The way I feel sometimes its too hard to sit still
Things are so passionate times are so real
Sometimes I try an chill mellow down blowin smoke
Smile on my face but its really no joke
You feel it in the streets people breathe without hope
They goin through the motion they dimmin down they focus
The focus gettin clear and the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly sometimes ya dont hear me
I push it past the bass no nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones black Im so wide awake
That I hardly ever sleep my flows forever deep
And its volumes or scriptures when I breath on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
Im every where penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave tall lead you onna shell
Universal ghetto life holla black you know it well
Quiet storm vital form pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force high level right across
Shoulders the lions raw voice is the siren
I swing round ring out and bring down the tyrant
Shocked a small act could knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous theres no need for fightin
Suttins tryna hide like the struggle wont find em
And the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him
Everywhere penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave talkll lead you on a shell
Universal ghetto life holla black you know it well
You dont know here it is
and always on time and rockin ya mind
Sit and come relax riddle of the mac its the patch
Im a soldier in the middle of Iraq
Well say about noonish commin out the whip
And lookin at me curious a young Iraqi kid awww
Carrying laundry whats wrong G hungry
No gimme my oil get fuck out my country
And in Arabian barkin other stuff
Till his moms come grab him and they walk off in a rush
Distrust feelin like I pissed upon wounds
Im like surely hope that we can fix our differences soon bye
Buyin apples Im breakin on
You take everything why not just take the damn food black bastard
I dont understand it on another planet
51 of this stuff how Im gunna manage
Gettin down on their middle eastern instruments
Walk over kicked one of my fabulous raps la dee da dee
Arab jaw drop they well wished they glad wrapped
Now the kid considered like an Elvis of BaghdadLyrics submitted by Jordan
Lawwwwd lawd have mercy
All nice and peace and true follow me now we say
Say hitek yes youre ruling hiphop
Say j rawls yes youre ruling hiphop
Redefinition say youre ruling hiphop
Say black star come to rock it non
Yo from the first to the last of it delivery is passionate
The whole and not the half of it vocab and not the math of it
Projectile that them blasted with accurate assassin shit
Me and kweli close like bethlehem and nazareth
After this you be pressing rewind on top your master disk
Shining like an asterisk for all those that be gatherin
Connectin like a roundhouse from the townhouse to the tenaments
Cause all my brooklyn residents heavy regiments
Dont believe here the evidence where brooklyn whaaaaaaaoohhhh
See that bound to take it all kid believe that
From where they sellin tree at to where the police be at
Talib kweli ekwelity yo tell them where we be at
Brooklyn new york city where they paint murals of biggie
In cash we trust cause its ghetto fabulous life look pretty
What a pity blunts is still fifty cents its intense
Tree scents is dominant cant be covered with incense
My presence felt my name is kweli from the eternal reflection
People thinkin mc is short hand for mis conception
Let me meditate set it straight came to the conclusion
That most of these cats is featherweight let me demonstrate
Walkin the streets is like battlin be careful with your body
You must know karate or think your soul is bulletproof like sade
Stop actin like a bitch already be a visionary
And maybe you can see your name in the column of obituary
Third rate teacher readin and talkin about
i knew hed amount to nothin
Neighbors like he was the quiet type
Whod have thought they was frontin
Talkin loud like you in rca get carted away
With body parts and treys what a way to start your day
Chorus mos def and talib kweli
Mos def and talib kweli
We came to rock it on to the tiptop
Best alliance in hiphop wyahhhhh
I said one two three
Its kind of dangerous to be a emcee
They shot tupac and biggie
Too much violence in hiphop wyahhhhh
I said manhattan keep on makin it bo brooklyn keep on takin it bo
So relax were takin it back redhook where were livin at
Plenty cats be strugglin not hustlin and bubblin
It aint about production and what else we discussin
When the cock crows my crop grows enable me to rock flows
Strivin for perfection ever since I was a snotnosed
Colossal true original bboy apostle
Standin on the rooftop with the zulu gestapo
You think you the shit
Somebody in the wingsll force you to quit
It could be your crew or click
Or some random kid you smoked buddha with
Consider me the entity within the industry without a history
Of spittin the epitome of stupidity livin my life
Expressin my liberty it gotta be done properly
My name is in the middle of ekwelity
People follow me and other cats they hear him flow
And assume Im the real one with lyrics like Im cyrano
Still sippin wishin well water imported from pluto
Three hundred and sixty milliliters for all our believers
In miles or kilometers most cats cannot proceed us
In the jungle with the leaders we the lions you the cheaters
A cypher will complete us if we come through your receivers
You can play us and repeat us and then take us home and read us
line for line good jesus mos def and kweli just
Make a pussy freeze up thinkin we will ease up
Llámame Flac pero mi primer nombre es Jacin Andante
El apellido el pay
La hermosa el peligro distinto claro que si la verdad
Ciudad calidad no mejor mala mas
Guerra y vida amor y cambio
La luz en la distancia
Bien es mas cercana
Mi vista mi casa mis sueños mi alma
Quiero saber lo sentí tu abrazo
Claro claro claro que si
Claro claro claro que si
Y no hay nada mas
Claro claro claro que si
Call me thin but my first name is Jaci Andante the one who walks
The last name the one who pays
The beauty the danger is different of course it is the truth
City quality no better worse
War and life love and change
Food that is being kept
Pistol this prayer is for them
The light in the distance
My sight my house my dreams my soul
I want to know and feel your embrace
Of course of course of course yes
Of course of course of course yes
And there is nothing else
Of course of course of course yesLyrics submitted by Kiandra
