When I woke up this morning
I turned to touch her hair
And she was gone she was gone
And there beside my pillow
Were her tears from the night before
She said give up your guns and face the law
I robbed a bank in Tampa
And I thought I had it made
But the hounds picked up my trail within the glades
And I stumbled on this cabin
And she came to me to me once more
She said give up your guns
She said give up your guns
She said give up your guns
This is a stick up stick up
Pistols will lift up lift up
If you dont get up get up
And we get numb and get silent
Get my gun into firing
Im never runnin or hidin
Verse One Royce Da 59
About a hundred any minute bullets runnin from the guns
In front of any one of yall youngins
We aint trippin in the winter
We aint slippin we aint sittin
You aint listen this is me
Bitch this Is Nickel bitch
Get back gettin stacks since 03
No strings yo swing wack
Like a dope fiend oh
Me and my team hot
Dream team I done seen
Like a green screen stuck before its cream
So they stuck him up in Sing Sing
I know what you mean dog
I been caught between walls
I dont kill Im the boss
I just make Scream calls
I dont aim I dont give a speech in the streets
Like Im livin in the movie
I just let the thing off
Hittin up my funds while Im rippin up the slums
With the only pistol left
Cause they givin up they
And now Im in this cabin where my own true love should be
Instead there lies a note she wrote to me
And it said though you cant live by the bullet
But you sure as dead can die
My love give up your guns or say goodbye
And the sheriff now is calling with a shotgun at my door
This is a stick up stick up
Pistols will lift up lift up
If you dont get up get up
And we get numb to get silent
Get my gun into firing
Im never runnin or hidin
Hell naw my niggas dont make speeches
Cause we aint no fake preachers
Soon as the state releases
You quickly learn the difference
Remember when Sai got shot
Yo it was winter he layed on the ice shiverin
He was killed for being hungry and young
Violently is how the company run
They dump in the slum
See the flashing lights and the gun
At the end of the tunnel no rebuttal to run
The blood is the sum of the equation
When you add up the factors
Life dont matter to rappers
So we glorify and glamorize
Talk about our plans to die
And learn to always stay inside the motherfuckin cameras eye
Get my good side murder is so sexy
But the hood cried every time one of us would die
Give up my guns never you crazy
Put you right out lets try it out
Blow a hole in your vest
With suitcase money I roll up the stretch
Squeeze faster than new Vs
Fresh new bags of bullets or bean
Got my paper poppin and plottin
I blow a hole right through your stocking
Come out your back and scratch up your lockin
We real killas and don dons
Pop through the vagabond tons
Boulevards where niggas will pull a card
Wrong songs dont play me lady killas
Baby guerrillas with hate feelings
Thatll spray up the ceilings
The best ninjas in the business
Malicious team we live in the kitchens
And dis niggas go the fuck home
Come to the rally and flash if you with this
Im not playin We shoot niggas All day Keep them hollows nigga They got
New little guns New little joints with long baby missiles in it Them the
Joints we play with nigga The Einsteins is on nigga Hard bottoms in
The hoodie Ice Water nigga Word up General Shala Raekwon All day
Eday A professional Yeah Get that money niggas Dont never give up
Them guns You stupid Lyrics submitted by koalby owens
I don’t know what else to say
I can’t I can’t think of nothin’
Here we go Here we go
On your feet On your feet
Stand up Stand up
Everybody hands up Hands up
Uh man I dunno man
Everytime I go to think of something played out to say
You already said it
Verse 1 Royce da 5’9″
I ain’t calling names cause all of y’all the same plus
I’m the king all my past pain all done changed up
All these plains all these lames since the Slaughter’s came up
Cause they know they hands tied feet ball and chained up
Nggas be quick to call me the new 50 Cent
Because of my relationship with Marshall
Used to make me a little partial but here’s the brain fck
We the same cuz
I’m probably about to fall out with a young buck
While I attempt to fck the fcking game up
Bitch splat only thing I fear in here is chitchat
You are hearing bars like your ear against a Kit Kat
Shady guys like the Navy drive wavy byebye
Maybe my Glock can turn your top to baby’s Maybach
My shit is powerful literally sick trust me ngga
It’s ugly to kill a thing if the bigger I get
The more disgusting and fckin’ disfigured it gets
Nggas expect me to go pop oh stop
Y’all about the champagne I’m about the toast
I only fck with mailmen with heroin from Boca
Nggas that’ll smoke you while you staring in your postbox
Only incense he enlightens when he’s thinkin’
While that sinks in I got a Brinks ink pen
Notice the flyness on the cover of the XXL
I’m back from the dead like Tobey Maguire from the Brothers
How y’all realer How y’all realer If I said it I did it
If I didn’t I seen it firsthand like a car dealer
Give up the throne your lease up I am the Mona Lisa
That decoded Da Vinci Code you throwin’ your piece up
Is a waste of fake like a phony Bcup
Ngga the mistake was like my only teacher
Wait ’til they get a load of me ’cause
I’ve got Gucci’s on my feet
Diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my wrist
Bitches on my dick
But y’all already said that
Models in the front
Bottles in the club
But I don’t give a fck
But y’all already said that
Cause sometimes I feel like it’s so hard
For me to come up with shitty to say Ayyyyyy
I’m at a loss for words ’cause y’all already said it all
I think I’m runnin’ out of cliches
I’m gettin’ writer’s block
Verse 2 Royce da 59
When I stand up in this booth nggas notice it
Sittin’ on the same boat that Noah built
Floatin’ on the same water Moses split
Poetry in motion but we sittin’ on your grave site overkill
Aren’t you tired Why are you so loud Quiet
Real dudes move in silence like a mute drivin’ a new hybrid
You dudes is too excited
You a dude that’d try to sue a dude that’s suicidal
You will just be another victim
I am like a nickel of weed rolled in a doobie I’m a little twisted
I roll like the end credits in movies y’all just got scripted
Got y’all nggas’ bitches bobbin’ to this one when she witcha
When she wit’ me she bobbin’ not vibin’
Tryna put her mind into the inside of my zipper
I’m a sperate with a purpose havin’ problems
Not a problem I’ve encountered
I have found elephants lions clowns
Will jump through hoops like they workin’ for the circus
At the fire round the circle’s right in front of them fire rounds
Pun intended gun extended what are you mark’s askin’
Car’s Aston started as a hardtop and I saw past it
Since I decided to start Class diss
All black all glass panoramic roof been gettin’ marked absent
I authorize my own allaccess
Your bitch a whore I’m a catch she ballcatchin’
Her jaw’s been broadcasted all across the globe from the store to Japan
Her pssy need to blocked and reported as spam
Bong Interscope up in this dope and I sell it
My voicemail is full got bitches screamin’ inside of envelopes
And they tryna mail ‘em to me tryna reach my phone
I don’t know which one is harder
Tryna not to take your bitch or tryna get rid of my own
I got Gucci’s on my feet
Diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my wrist
Bitches on my dick
But y’all already said that
Models in the front
Bottles in the club
But I don’t give a fuck
But y’all already said that
Cause sometimes I feel like it’s so hard
For me to come up with shitty to say Ayyyyyy
I’m at a loss for words ’cause y’all already said it all
I think I’m runnin’ out of cliches
I’m gettin’ writer’s block
We need to start bringin’ that shit back Mad flava
Man fck it I’m ’bout to catch some wreck We in effect money
Mad props to Royce for keepin’ it real
On the strength no diggity
I’m ’bout to go pull some hoes get my mack on
Let me know what you think of the Royce Da 5’9′ Writers Block LyricsLyrics submitted by Kaylen James St
