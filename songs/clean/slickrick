La di da di la di da di
You know what you peep this
La di da di we like to party
We dont cause trouble we dont bother nobody
Were just some men thats on the mic
And when we rock upon the mic
We rock the mic right
For all a yall keepin yall in health
Just to see ya smile and enjoy yaself
Cause its cool when you cause a cozy conditionin
That we create so thats our mission so listen
To what we say because this type of shit happens everyday
I woke up around ten oclock in the mornin
Gave myself a strech up a mornin yawn and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
Had some soap on my face and my hand upon the cup
I said a mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top choice of them all
There was a rumble dumble
Five minutes it lasted the mirror said
you are you concieted bastard
Yo thats true thats why we never have no beef
So then i washed off the soap and brushed the gold teeth
Used oil of olay cause my skin gets pale
Then i got the files for my fingernails
True to the style on my behalf
I put the bubbles in the tub so i could have a bubble bath
Clean dry was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new gucci underwear
For all the girls i might take home
I got the johnsons baby powder and the polo colonge
Fresh dressed like a millions bucks threw on the valley shoes
And the fly green socks
Stepped out the house stopped short oh no
I went back in i forgot the
Then i dilly dally ran through a alley
Bumped into my old girl sally from the valley
This was a girl playing hard to get
So i said whats wrong cause she looked upset
She said uh its all because of you
Say what im feeling sad and blue
She said what you went away
And now my life is filled with rainy days
And i love you so how much youll never know
Cause you took your love away from me
Now what was i to do
She was crying over me and she was feeling blue
I said dont cry dry your eye
Here comes your mother with those two little guys
Her mean mother steps and says to me hi
Hit sally in the face and decked her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong the kids was gone
Something was wrong i said what was going on
I tried to break it up i said stop it leave her
She said if i cant have you she cant either
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So i broke the hell out like i had the chicken pox
But uh she gave chase she caught up quick
She put a finger in the face of mc rick and said
So we can go cruising in my oj and what
Ill give you all my love today
What ricky ricky ricky what
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And i just love your jazzy ways
Yo mc rick my love is here to stay
And on and on and on she kept on
The bitch been around before my mothers born
I said cheer up i gave her a kiss
I said you cant have me im too young for you miss
She said no youre not then she starts crying
I says im thirtyfour she says stop lying
I said i am go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy i cant be your lover
To the tick tock and you dont stopf
To the tick tick ya dont hit it
Doug e fresh yall give him a round of applause yall

A teenage love a teenage love
Dont dont hurt me again
Aye sport heres a thought from the old school crew
A serious situation we all go threw
It deals wit your feelins so here what I say
Its like a dyke but nothing seems to go your way
Bust this two people they really like each other
He says theirs no one else
And she claims theyre is no other
The feelins are same and you receive a notion
To reveal your inner thoughts deeply hit emotions
Precious times hopin they wont end
Tell your mother bout your lover
Or so your best friend
Ya mighty proud while your holdin her hand
Boys yo thats my woman and girls yeah thats my man
This pressure brings a sort of warmth to ya heart
And everything seems so great at the start
For she loves him and he also loves her
And its hard to turn back to who the person you were
But later on problems start to occur
And the bond which combines yall turn into a blur
For the feelins were the same now heres the score
You love him to much and they dont love him anymore
Or did you have to choose a number
Or because your not bein true
Or maybe theyre just plain sick of seein you
Word now it might seem strange
You better take his quick and make the right change
See just when you swore the boy was wrong and
Then theyre gone and part of ya hearts been stolen
Get back on your feet wit a hop and a skip
But no you rather go wit this dead relationship
Hangin around and buyin him stuff
You seem him every darn day you dont see him enough
You follow them around and they claim ya hawkin
When conversation comes you do all the talkin
Not to mention attention we all need a bit
Behind ya back theyre sayin yeah hes all on my tits
Theyre gettin sick of you and quite annoyed
And if you had plans for the future theyre now destroyed
You saw what was happenin and you still let it
And if you ever let him make love to ya girl you can forget it
Sweetheart you been caught spread around town
And break up time and your recitine the words
Yo this is fromt the heart and I know the part hearts
Get over it from now dont take short slick
If its not true love you shouldnt deal wit it
Just think of your future and what is to come
And pay attention to the words thats in this song they go
Do you know where ya goin to
Do like the things that life is showin you
And are you going to Lyrics submitted by Marquita Chocolatechip Foreman
