What if the sky was turning red
I know well be safe
Right here in my bed
Ooh girl I love the way you sound
When you rain on me
So tonight lets act it out
Show you how its gonna be
Im gonna kiss your other set of lips
Hold yo body by yo legs and hips
The world cant end until the finish
We gonna do its bout to be the end of the world
And they dependent on us
To make earth shake in love
Tellin to go harder Go harder
Ya tellin me to go deeper Go deeper
I feel yo knees gettin weaker and weaker We can go longer if you try to lay down Lay down down
All these vibrations from ya legs
I got ya body shiverin
Cause we covered in sweat
And girl I like the way it opens up
When you throw it back baby
Girl it might be too much ohh
Baby if you keep doin that
I got that pillow for your knees right here
Baby can you make it disappear
Your voice is the last thing your gonna hear
Then I wanna make you holla
We gonna do it like its bout to be the end of the world
And they dependent on us
To make the earth shake of love
Lay down Tellin to go harder
You tellin me to go deeper Go deeper
I feel yo knees gettin weaker and weaker
Do it like we only got one Got one
Baby lets pretend we only got one Night
Let me take my time
Do it to you right
Buildin them bridges may be fallin down
But that wont stop me
From turnin that thing around
Wont ya on come over
And we can treat it like its the mother fuckin
To make the earth shake in love
As we lay down
Tellin me to go harder Go harder
A nigga goin harder in the paint Tellin me to go deeper go deeper
So deep you can feel my submarine I feel yo knees gettin weaker and weaker
Lay down downLyrics submitted by Clayvonte Abner
And Im just tryna try angles
Just tryna solve the whole equation
Whats it about you about you
Picking you up picking you up
So I can touch you
Should we do that Can I do that baby
Answers are usually in the back
Baby just add me baby just add me in
Baby just add me baby just add me in
Ill calculate her home invasion
Divide your legs and count to 3 3 2 1 come on
Hes just not the answer baby
And thats just my hypothesis
Whats it about you about you
Picking you up picking you up
So I can touch you
Should we do that Can I do that baby
Answers are usually in the back
Girl if I said I loved you I need you
So many things that I could learn
Baby if we do the math it will equal up to me
Whats it about you about you
Picking you up picking you up
So I can touch you
Should we do that Can I do that baby
Answers are usually in the back
Baby just add me baby just add me in
Baby just add me baby just add me in

How did you get so young
I heard you were born today
Heard that you came and found
The sky and i just wanna say
Welcome the world is glad youre here to stay
Have fun is time to give another day
Sometimes the fire gets in your way
I will have one too
I wish i can stay with you
How much I want all your wishes to come true
Its all about youIts all about you
I swear Ill give you everything
New car parked out front
Flowersbags and weeding rings
Well done the world is glad youre here to stay
Have fun is time to give another day
Sometimes the fire gets in your way
I will have one too
I wish i can stay with you
How wishes to come true
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
If I have a moment
Id capture that moment
You would be right here next to me
If I had the secret
The secret to your love
I would plant your treasure beneath my heart
Lock it all up
Throw away the key
I would never give it up
Cause I was just a fool
A fool for you
And I loved you so childishly
And I want it all back
I want it all
I want it all
Girl I want it all back
I want it all back
I want it all
I want it all
Girl I want it all
You never miss a good thing til its gone
I want it all now I want it all back
If there is a green light
And its bout to turn yellow
Pedal to the floor cause I know your heart is turning red
If I had the minutes I would turn them into hours
And make love to your mind and not your body instead
I was just a fool
That didnt know what I had until I lost you
Every single moment that youre not here
Its evident to me that everything just seems all clear
Now everything isnt everything
If everything everything isnt with you
And I want it all back
I want it all
I want it all
Girl I want it all back
I want it all back
I want it all
I want it all
Girl I want it all
You never miss a good thing till its gone
I want it all now I want it all back
Now I want it all back now I want it all back
Now I want it all backLyrics submitted by Mateo

You don’t even call anymore
It’s so different from the way it was before
Everyday I’d hear your pretty voice
I’ve had no choice but to be all alone without you
There are so many mistakes we make in love
Cuz still I’m think this is something we can solve
I’ll take all the blame for breaking your heart
But you can’t let it tear us apart because
She didn’t mean anything to me nothing
She wasn’t the one I see in my dreams ohh nooo
And you know it aint true if you believe yeaa
Please accept my apology please accept my apology baby
I didn’t mean to hurt you girl
I didn’t see myself settling down
But I knew from the first time you came around
From the moment I looked into your eyes
I’d never wanted to see you cry over me
But I knew if we got serious in love
We would never ever wanna break it up
I wasn’t ready for until this day
Could you believe when I say that she
She didn’t mean anything to me no she didn’t
She wasn’t the one I see in my dreams no she was not
And you know it aint true yeaif you believe
Please accept my apology baby I didn’t mean
I didnt mean to hurt you girl
She didnt mean anything to me nooo
She wasnt the one I see in my dreams
Girl you know it aint trueif you believe
Please accept my apology whoaa
I didnt mean to hurt you girlLyrics submitted by Jaedon
If you leave this time I fear that youll be gone for good
So I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and
He said hell be back with that same
Tone that you just said youll stay forever with
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like youre the only reason for it
All the things you do all the things you do all the things you do
All the things you do all the things you do all the things you do
Its safe to say youre the only reason for it
Ive been bleeding in your silence
I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves and fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God
He must be mad with me its coming
Im confused to wholl Ill spend my forever with
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like youre the only reason for it
All the things you do all the things you do all the things you do
All the things you do all the things you do all the things you do
Its safe to say youre the only reason for it
So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it
And I poke and I poke and I poked at it
But it stayed stagnant then I poked at it some more some more
And in my notepad man I wrote and I wrote
If I dont have it if I dont grab it
If it dont chip then a toe tag is one last
Im a hope Im a hope so the iceberg dont float
If I do manage to do damage to you dammit
Itd be grandest ten grammies or my granite still standing
With a note a note that read granted dont you panic
When you make mistakes the most the most
One day itll make you grow you grow
When you outlandish and you lose manners
To God you shall consult consult
When the bright cameras are still cramming
In your face and it provoke provoke
You to act manic just stay planted
Cause you reapin what you sowed
Keep positivity in your heart and
Keep a noose from round your throat and
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just know man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you renew your vision
Just think if it had sunk Titanic what the fuck would you do to a critic my nigga
Yeah yeah tell me when doves cry do you hear em love
Do you hear em love Do you hear em
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort
And they wont let me live even when we mustard the gift
When it gon rejoice and forgive tell me how I stay positive
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me
Dont mean he wont redeem me Lord
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like youre the only reason for it
All the things you do all the things you do all the things you do
All the things you do all the things you do all the things you do
Its safe to say youre the only reason for it
I know its late I know its late

Some people have to learn
some people wait there turn
some people have to fight
some people give it up
They wanna hold you back tell ‘em pee off
whenever they say you can’t take the T off
I remember when they told me I couldn’t be famous
now my dream and reality is simultaneous
and work your own way to the top
if they put you on a pedestal they can take you off
and there’s a higher level than the top
you gotta make more don’t do with what you got
yeah so get it in go sunny
not everybody gets a second chance at getting money
or even getting lucky so you gotta feel
the hunger in your tummy
I’m always pushing myself to the limit
making sure I stay ahead
you made me who I am from the words you said
Some people have to learn
some people wait there turn
some people but not me
I was born a champion
some people have to fight
some people give their lives
I was born a champion
but I was born a champion
but I was born a champion
Chris Brown Verse 2
This gon be the realest shit I ever wrote
off the record no camera’s forget a quote
some of my family doing good most doing dope
I from Virginia where they hang the nggas by rope
I used to see my momma getting beat down
Is that the real definition of me now
I fell off back on my feet now
headed to the sky can’t even see down
award shows I poured my heart out
and people still steady trynna point my flaws out
and I’d be lying if I said it ain’t get to me
but I’m a champion legend history
Imagine you was the one that couldn’t get a look in
couldn’t get a push in when you needed a shove
or your buttons they be pushing
so now they tryna shush him
it’s only you believing in you
they turn you into a bastard than moment you rude
attitude a little out of tune
but thats how champions move
yeah so go and get it in sunny
not everybody gets a second chance at getting money
so you gotta feel the hunger in your tummy
I guess you’re on your own
build a foundation with the bricks they throw
in a black and white World True colours show
change if you wante verybody grows
life’s like an ill but try and get a hold
opinions aint fact take em and let em go
You made me who I am from the words you said
Some people have to learn
some people wait there turn
some people but not me
I was born a champion champion
some people have to fight
some people give their lives
but I was born a champion
Some people have to learn
some people wait there turn
some people but not me
I was born a champion champion

Waiting for me to fuck up
You’ll regret the day when I find another girl yeah
Who knows just what I need she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free

I know you mad but so what
I wish you best of luck
And now im finna throw them deuces up
Im on some new shit
Im chuckin my deuces up to her
Im moving on to something better better better
No more tryin to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye say bye bye say bye bye to her x2
Uh Use to be valentines
Thought it was true love but you know women lie
Its like I sent my love with a text two times
Call cause I care but I aint get no reply
Tryna see eye to eye but its like we both blind
Fuck it lets hit the club i rarely sip but pour me some
Cause when its all said and done
I aint gon be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars fuck love Im tired of tryin
My heart big but it beat quiet
I don’t never feel like we vibin
Cause every time we alone its a awkward silence
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit is over whatchu trippin for
I don’t wanna have to let you go
But baby I think its better if I let you know
Im on some new shit
Im chuckin my deuces up to her
Im moving on to something better better better
No more tryin to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye say bye bye say bye bye to her x2
Look my shorty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces we aint got no future in tomorrow
I’m a dick so it shouldn’t be that hard to swallow
The other chick Im with never complain
She make wanna leave the one im with Usher Raymond
Probably didn’t register don’t trip later on it will
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles
I finally noticed it it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo it finally hit me
I got a new chick and she aint you
She paula patton thick She give me déjà vu
And all that attitude I don’t care bout it
But all that shit I do for her you gon hear bout it
Breezy rep two up two down
But im just puttin two up chuckin up the deuce now
Im on some new shit
Im chuckin my deuces up to her
Im moving on to something better better better
No more tryin to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye say bye bye say bye bye to her x2Lyrics submitted by Samantha
Im the one that lost the view
I hope you havnt said it too
So where do we go from here
With all this fear in our eyes
And where can love take us now
And weve been so far down
We can still touch the sky
till we can walk again
Until were strong enough to jump
Until there is no end
Why did I change the pace
Hearts were never meant to race
Always felt the need for space
And now I cant reach your face
So where are you standing now
Are you in the crowd of my folksvoice
Love cant you see my hand
Lend me one more chance
We can still have it all
till we can walk again
until were strong enough to jump
until there is no end
Well I never wanna lose that view
Till we can walk again
Until were strong enough to jump
Until there is no end
Till we can walk again
Until were strong enough to jump
Until there is no end

You make me wanna say ba bye
Say ba bye say ba bye
Ah used to Valentines together all the time
Thought it was true love but you know women lie
Its like I sent my love with a two times
Call cuz I care but I aint gettin no reply
Tryna see eye to eye but its like we both blind
Fk it lets hit the club I rarely said but pour me some
Cuz when its all said and done I aint gonna be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars fk love Im tired of trying
My heart big but it be quiet
Ill never feel like we vibing cuz everytime we alone its an akward silence
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter and gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond
St is over what you trippin for
I dont wanna have to let you go but baby I think its better if I let you know
Im with some new st
Im chucking my deuces up to her Deuces
Im moving on to something better
No more tryin to make it work Deuces
You make me wanna say ba bye
Say ba bye say ba bye
You make me wanna say ba bye
Say ba bye say ba bye
Look my shawty always on some bt like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces we aint got no future and tomorrow
Im a dk so it shouldnt be that hard to swallow
The other chick Im with never complaining
She make me wanna leave the one Im with Usher Raymond
Probably didnt register dont trip
Later on it will
Shawty full of drama like gangsta grazilles
I finally noticed it it finally hit me
Like Tina did iking in limo it finally hit me
I got a new chick and she aint you
She ballin pack a dk she give me deja vu
And all that attitude I dont care about it
But all that st I do for her you gon hear about it
Breezy rap two up two down
But Im just putting two up
Chucking up the deuce now
Im with some new st Im chucking my deuces up to her
Im moving on to something better
No more tryin to make it work Deuces
You make me wanna say ba bye
Say ba bye say ba bye
You make me wanna say ba bye
Say ba bye say ba bye
I dont know why I even try
Cause you dont want this no more
I would rather leave before I hurt you
And I would have died long ago if I didnt have my faith
I see youre starting to hate me
I see it in your face
My home dont feel like home
Just like my heart its empty
Changed the number on your phone
So when I call you aint gotta listen
And all your girls think that I aint shit
And they the same ones lost in the club
Now Im number one thats lost in love
Girl I cant take it
Youre gonna see a grown man cry
Im starting to hate me
A little more and more each day
Its like I cant get out of my own way
And you dont love me you dont love me
If I knew better I would do better
Looking at the names on your list and I cant find me
Im deep underwater are you gon let me drown
I see youre happy now
Youre the life of the party acting out
Aint seen you in months you aint call me once
And all your boys say that I aint shit
And they the same ones lost in the club
And Im the one who lost in love
And I cant take it
Dont you hate to see me cry
Im starting to hate me
A little more and more each day
Its like I cant get out of my own way
And you dont love me you dont love me
If I knew better I would do better
Thinking bout you and I thinking bout you and I
My hearts beating in slow motion knowing that its a lie
Thoughts got me thinking bout suicide
Baby this is do or die
When you told me its over
Aint no point in being sober
All I wanna do is fade away
I hope that God for forgive me
Cause I know you aint gon miss me
Baby girl I wont try to say my goodbyes
You aint gotta shed a tear for me
Im starting to hate me
A little more and more each day
Its like I cant get out of my own way
And you dont love me you dont love me
If I knew better I would do better I would do better I would do better
I would do better
I dug a single seed into the ground
I hope it grows grows
In a year or two if youre around
Youll see a rose rose
Pack me up and keep me hidden somewhere that you can find me
On a train to Paris going nowhere trouble is behind me
Dont be gone too long too long
Cause you wont be there to love me when youre gone
Dont be gone too long too long
Tell me whos gonna love me when youre gone
Golden leaves are dancing on the ground
Safe from time will be forever young
See a ball of fire out in space zooming up behind me
All the wonder written in your face
Dont be gone too long too long
Cause you wont be there to love me when youre gone
Dont be gone too long too long
Tell me whos gonna love me when youre gone
Bring it back to me bring it back to me
Bring it back to me bring it back to me baby dont worry
Bring it back to me bring it back to me
Bring it back to me bring it back to me
Bring it back to me bring it back to me baby dont worry

Dont be gone too long too long
Tell me whos gonna love me when youre gone
Dont be gone too long too long
Cause you wont be there to love me when youre gone
Dont be gone too long too long
Tell me whos gonna love me when youre gone
I dont wanna go there
We should never go there
Why you wanna go there
I guess I gotta go there
Youre hearing rumours about me
And you cant stomach the thought
Of someone touching my body
When you so close to my heart
I wont deny what they saying
Because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you
So please dont judge me
And I wont judge you
Cause it could get ugly
And I wont judge you
And if you love me
Then let it be beautiful
Let it be beautifuuul let it be beautiful
Let it be beautifuuul let it be beautiful
Everything I say right now
Is gonna be use in another fight
And Ive been through this so many times
Can we change the subject
You gonna start asking me questions like
Was she attractive Was she an actress
Youre hearing rumours about me
And saw some pictures online
Saying things got you so angry
Making you wish you were mine
Before we start talking crazy
Saying some things well regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset
So please dont judge me
And I wont judge you
Cause it could get ugly
And I wont judge you
And if you love me
Then let it be beautiful
That are gonna make us laugh
Take me as I am love who I was
Ill promise Ill be the one that you can trust
So please dont judge me
And I wont judge you
Cause it could get ugly
And I wont judge you
And if you love me
Then let it be beautiful
Let it be beautiful x4

Dearly beloved if this love only exists in my dreams
Too much light in this window dont wake me up
Only coffee no sugar inside my cup
If I wake and youre here still give me a kiss
I wasnt finished dreaming about your lips
Dont wake me up up up up up up
Dont wake me up up up up up up
Dont wake me up up up up up up
Dont wake me up up up up up up
So much life in the city you wont believe
Been awake for some days now no time to sleep

Tell me what is the music inside my head
Dont wake me up up up up up up
Dont wake me up up up up up up
Dont wake me up up up up up up

My tongue writing you letters
Well be making love until the morning after
And I can feel your tide slowly rising
As Im sipping from your water fountain

If I could take a trip to outer space
She would be the one I will see
When I get to heavens gate
She would welcome me with her arms open wide and a smile
Will shadow me brighter than the sun
She hasnt had a fair chance so Ill give her one
Let me tell you who she is yeah
shes a fallen angel
Sent from heaven up above
shes a fallen angel
Waiten for me to love her yeah
know that she is a fallen angel
Take your judgment off her
i know that shes a fallen angel
You know I could help her mend her broken wings
So she can fly again
But I dont want to lose everything that ive gained
Its turnin me a selfish man oh
Cause without my heart just dont go
I couldnt take the pain from watchin her fly away
So say that youll stay
shes a fallen angel
Sent fron heaven up above
shes a fallen angel
Waiten for me to love her yeah
shes a fallen angel
So take your judgment off her
i know that shes a fallen angel
Baby dont you dont you worry worry
Yo mama dont you worry you goin reach the sky

Sent from heaven up above

Waiten for me to wrap my heart around her

Baby I know I know that they done hurt you
But Im here lets just take it all away
So if you let me
You know what just put your heart in my hands and everything they say
And youll never make it

Ye wouldve said youre So Amazing
So how could you be so Heartless girl
Live your life take TIME
Day N Nite just like Kid Cudi
You think of me you will
Drake would say that youre the Best He Ever Had
Rumors come and go but you keep your shadow
Everywhere you go it follows
Cant understand I still love you
Since I thought I found the right woman
There were other guys who thought the same thing about her
Like damn you let me down down down
Cuz youre famous girl for breakin hearts
Youre famous girl girl girl x3
Shouldve know youd break my heart heart heart
Keri wouldve said my love Knocked Her Down
Keyshia wouldve told me I was Sent From Heaven
Sorry B I dont wear no Halo
You were first to play the game though
Sorry I Bust The Windows Out Your Car
I mightve cheated in the beginning
I was wrong for writing Disturbia
but I meant it in Forever
We were supposed to be together
And I cant let you go
Since you thought you found the right man
There were other girls who thought the same thing about me
Like damn I let you down down down
Cuz Im famous girl for breakin hearts
Im famous girl girl girl x3
Didnt know Id break your heart heart heart
Im famous girl girl girl x3
Didnt know Id break your heart heart heart
Many hearts we shouldve left unbroken
Empty words are better left unspoken
Too much pressure I wish time was frozen
Since we lost our way now
I hope youre happy being famous
Youre famous girl girl girl x3
Shouldve known youd break my heart heart heart
Im famous girl girl girl x3

I see you writing on my wall why you wanna do that do that
my names tagged you already see that see that the media wants to paint it all black and they do it right in my face
See I can’t sit back and let it all wash away I worked to hard for it to be erased
before you talk Imma finish what I gotta say
cause i allready put in time with all of my grind
and all of my grinding grinding
trough all of this struggle
even through the pain I still wanted to hustle
Man I had to feed my family and that’s just sayin
and that’s just sayin damn keep my sanity
Man I cant let you do it
Graffiti you tryna spray Spray on me
Graffiti you tryna spray Spray on me
Graffiti you tryna spray Spray on me
All the graffiti you try to spray on my name
but its already writin on the wall cant cover it up
but its already writin on the wall cant cover it up
Who got award shows rocking every time I hit the stage
Even the haters went and bought a CD
Without my fans I’m an empty spray can
and I just cant paint a thing
seems like the less I have the money the less I have the problems
the more I got the money the more I got the problems
Let me clear my book gotta make sure you hear me go
It’s already done aint got no pain anymore
All this pain that I
I know it was wrong for what I did
and I make some mistakes cause I’m human
and I aint gonna beat it to the negative
I was 15 a Virginia nigga with ambitions
Young but I envisioned fucking them bad bitches
Live my life with no regrets
I tried to show respect but you don’t give it
I guess you don’t understand winning
It might take me a life time to take it back
And it might take you a life time to know the facts
Yeah just cuz we different don’t mean we distant
And if you kill a man aint no way to bring him back
Yeah they say its mind over matter
But what we living for what really matters
Some niggas silver spoon just on a platter
And other niggas is just doomed for disaster
All along sleeping in my bedroom
As I wet the sheets mama gon’ be dead soon
Cuz a man beat her but he don’t realize she important to this family
Like a fucking heir loom
Yeah a nigga still found his way out
Record deal came a nigga played out
My mama living good she taking days out
They saying boy all that hard work paid off
500 racks for a hour show
But I aint never gonna do no 60 minute interview
Cuz all you wanna do is twist my words up
And all I wanna do is flip my birds up
Kinda tipsy off that red rum murda
Im a singing ass nigga I know you hurda
Me everyday my cliques stunting
Niggas talking down but imma make them pick their words up
I done said all I had to say whatevs
Cock suckers low blowing under my belt
Yeah they hanging from the tip trying get a sip
Don’t let them get a grip
I’m pissing on them myself
19 a nigga went through a tragedy
3 years a nigga just found a better me
Yeah you might find another lover
But you always started with Breezy like the letter B
Thinking do I really like this thug shit
Huh because fame aint freedom
And this diamond chain only mean they hold you hostage
Now I got a lot of offers telling me they wear they clothes
And they wanna be my sponsors
But when a nigga fall off again they be like off him
And then gonna smile up in your face just like awesome
Great wait police and the thug cannot relate
I guess why this wars on drugs is a debate
So I’m gon keep living my life from day to day…Learn from my mistakesLyrics submitted by Ashanti Black

I need your touch but your hands are locked away
I hear your voice youve got nothing left to say
Ill take this start of my heart
Ill take this bullet Ill take it for love
So if the lights in the sky come crashing down
I still can find your love even in the crowd
But will you remember me
Girl youll remember my name
Remember my name will you remember my name
Remember my name I love you I love you love you
Remember my name I love you I love you love you
Remember my name I love you I love you love you
I need my kiss but your lips are far away
So I have no choice so I guess Ill have to stay and love away
And Ima take this stop from my heart
Bang bang I take this bullet bang bang Ill take it for love
Bang bang Ill take it for love
Bang bang Ill take it for us

My heart is broken in two
She has a ring on the other hand
Too scared to tell me the truth
I want you to know that
I shouldve loved you way more way more
So this is the end of us now
You mean more to me than anything
And finished cause you dont love me
So I just wanna see you happy
I think that Im losing my mind
Its crazy cause we were so inseparable
Guess things change with time
Does he kiss and wipe away your tears
Does he tell you that theres nothing to fear
Oh if I had a wishing well I would have you right here
I want you to know that
I shouldve loved you way more way more
So this is the end of us now
You mean more to me than anything
And finished cause you dont love me
I didnt listen you went missing
He has your heart now
Wish I could keep you all to myself
I wanna work it out
But you dont see it now
Guess Ill see you around
Why am I mad I dont get it
It seems like everytime you give me signs
I left you standing there
And now I regret it
Lose my cool and I blow it
and I get all tongue tied
Im a fool and I know it
Told you just how I feel
And next time I wont stop
Ill listen to my heart
Cause what I feel is real
I shouldve told you how I feel
I shouldve showed you just how i feel
Give you my two cents
A million reasons why I should have
and it makes no sense
Stopping for green lights and Now I know
I wanna be more than friends
How come everytime I get the chance I
Lose my cool and I blow it
And i get all tongue tied
Im a fool and I know it
Told you just how I feel
And next time I wont stop
Ill listen to my heart
Cause what I feel is real
I shouldve told you how I feel
I shouldve showed you just how i feel
So I turned the car around
And you were right where I left you
And your smile said you were feeling me too
And the moon shined bright
Cause when your lips met mine
And yeah I finally got it right
Ill be leaving with you tonight
And I wont have to say
Told you just how I feel
And next time I wont stop
Ill listen to my heart
Cause what I feel is real
I shouldve showed you just how I feel
I shouldve showed you just how i feel
Girl I shouldve kissed you
I shouldve told you told you just how I feel
And this time I wont stop
Until I have your heart
Because This feeling is realLyrics submitted by taylor

Cause she was the only one
And I know I dead wrong
But if you youuuu
Ask her will she forgive me
If you ever see her

Then tell her its so cold

If you had a choice then
what would you choose to do
I could live without money
I could live without the fame
and if everyday was sunny i could live
without the rain and if i ever
went up to heaven i would fall
right back down that life wouldnt be living
cause your the one i couldnt live without
if i couldnt blink would i still be able to see you
without arms could i reach
no way could i ever hold you
i need these things like i need you
if u had a choice what would you choose
I could live without money
I could live without the fame
and if everyday was sunny i could live
without the rain and if i ever
went up to heaven i would fall
right back down that life wouldnt be living
cause your the one i couldnt live without
If i couldnt dream would i believe that
there could be a you and me
and if i couldnt sing would you be
able to hear my melody
i know that somethings wrong and im afraid
How can i fly when your my wings
i need these things like i need you
if you had a choice what would you choose
I could live without money
I could live without the fame
and if everyday was sunny i could live
without the rain and if i ever
went up to heaven i would fall
right back down that life wouldnt be living
cause your the one i couldnt live without
You can take it all from me
and it wouldnt mean anything
Turn the whole world against me
as long as you dont leave
Its getting hard for me to sleep
even harder for me to breath
Im used to life with you tell me what i need to do
I could live without money
I could live without the fame
and if everyday was sunny i could live
without the rain and if i ever
went up to heaven i would fall
right back down that life wouldnt be living
cause your the one i couldnt live without
I could live without money
I could live without the fame
and if everyday was sunny i could live
without the rain and if i ever
went up to heaven i would fall

If youre only as good as the company you keep
Then Imma blame you for what they say about me
Free your mind and let your conscience be free
When I was by myself I was fast asleep
Since you came around Ive been up for weeks
Free your mind and let your conscience be free
Yiyiyikes Ive been with the wrong crowd

I thought we were great
You took your love back and ran us off track
I count all the days
Til you would come back how stupid was that
Now youre missing what we used to have
Guess the vodka brought the feeling back
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now if you really want to know
Ask how many nights Ive been thinking of you zero zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you zero zero
I thought you were the one then you turned and runned
Found somebody better like I never met ya
Ask how many nights Ive been thinking of you zero zero
Zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
Thats how many fucks I give
Wake up with a dime
Get up to no good better than you could
Go out free our minds
Like you never would never understood
Now youre missing what we used to have
You been creepin round my Instagram
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now if you really wanna know
Ask how many nights Ive been thinking of you zero zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you zero zero
I thought you were the one then you turned around
Found somebody better like I never met ya
Ask how many nights Ive been thinking of you zero zero
Zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
Thats how many fucks I give
Broke back then but a nigga rich now
Got dollars got euros got yen I got pounds
Calling me up cause your bank check bounced
My new chick one hundred
And she got her own dinero zero
You think Im thinking about your ass
Ask how many nights Ive been thinking of you zero zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you zero zero
