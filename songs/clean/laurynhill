Its been three weeks since youve been looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
Member when he told you he was bout the Benjamins
You act like you aint hear him then gave him a little trim
To begin how you think you really gon pretend
Like you wasnt down then you called him again
Plus when you give it up so easy you aint even fooling him
If you did it then then you probably f again
Talking out your neck sayin youre a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the gin
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon tell when the repercussions spin
Showing off your ass cause youre thinking its a trend
Girlfriend let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it cause Im truly genuine
Dont be a hardrock when youre really a gem
Babygirl respect is just a minimum
Niggas fed up and you still defending them
Now Lauryn is only human
Dont think I havent been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly Penn
Its silly when girls sell their soul because its in
Look at where you be in hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again come again come again come again
Guys you know you better watch out
Some girls some girls are only about
That thing that thing that thing
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Dont care who they offend popping yang like you got yen
Lets not pretend they wanna pack pistol by they waist men
Cristal by the case men still in they mothers basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of their three and four kids men
They facing a court case when the childs support late
Money taking heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men the punk domestic violence men
The quick to shoot the sn stop acting like boys and be men
How you gon win when you aint right within
How you gon win when you aint right within
How you gon win when you aint right within
Come again come again come again come again
Girls you know you better watch out
Some guys some guys are only about
That thing that thing that thing
I was just a little girl
Skinny legs a press and curl
My mother always thought Id be a star
But way before my record deal
The streets that nurtured Lauryn Hill
Made sure that Id never go too far
Every ghetto every city and suburban place Ive been
Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem
Story starts at Hootaville grew up next to Ivy Hill
When kids were stealing quartervilles for fun
Kill the guy in Carter park
Rode a Mongoose til its dark
Watching kids show off the stolen ones
Every ghetto every city and suburban place Ive been
Make me recall my days in New Jerusalem
You know its hot dont forget what youve got
Looking back looking back looking back
You know its hot dont forget what youve got
Thinking back thinking back thinking back
A bag of Bontons twenty cents and a nickel
Springfield Ave had the best popsicles
Saturday morning cartoons and KungFu
Main street roots tonic with the dreds
A beef patty and some coco bread
Move the patch from my Lees to the tongue of my shoe
Member FrelngHuysen used to have the bomb leather
Back when Doug Fresh and Slick Rick were together
Looking at the crew we thought wed all live forever
You know its hot dont forget what youve got
Thinking back thinking back thinking back
You know its hot dont forget what youve got
Thinking back thinking back thinking back
Drill teams on Munn street
Remember when Hawthorne and Chancellor had beef
Moving Records was on Central Ave
I was there at dancing school
South Orange Ave at Borlin pool
Unaware of what we didnt have
Writing your friends names on your jeans with a marker
July 4th races off of Parker
The Untouchable PSP where all them crazy niggers be
And car thieves got away through Irvington
Hillside brings beef with the cops
And everybodys name was Muslim
Sensations and 88 attracted kids from outofstate
And everybody used to do the wop
Jack Jack Jack ya body
Nah the Biz Mark used to amp up the party
I wish those days they didnt stop
Every ghetto every city and suburban place Ive been
Make me recall my days in New Jerusalem
You know its hot dont forget what youve got
Welcome back welcome back welcome back
You know its hot dont forget what youve got

What is meant to be will be
After winter must come spring
I wrote these words for everyone
Who struggles in their youth
Instead of what is truth
It seems we lose the game
Before we even start to play
Who made these rules Were so confused
Let me tell ya that
After winter must come spring
Beat drum Abyssinian street Baptist
Rap this in fine linen
My practice extending across the atlas
Flippin in the ghetto on a dirty mattress
You cant match this rapper actress
More powerful than two Cleopatras
Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti
MCs aint ready to take it to the Serengeti
My rhymes is heavy like the mind of Sister Betty
L Boogie spars with stars and constellations
Then came down for a little conversation
Adjacent to the king fear no human being
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum
Where hip hop meets scripture
Develop a negative into a positive picture
What is meant to be will be
After winter must come spring
But things come slow or not at all
And the ones on top wont make it stop
So convinced that they might fall
Lets love ourselves then we cant fail
To make a better situation
Tomorrow our seeds will grow
All we need is dedication
Let me tell ya that
After winter must come spring
What is meant to be will be
After winter must come spring
What is meant to be will be

It could all be so simple
But youd rather make it hard
Loving you is like a battle
And we both end up with scars
Tell me who I have to be
No one loves you more than me
And no one ever will
Is this just a silly game
That forces you to act this way
Forces you to scream my name
Then pretend that you cant stay
Tell me who I have to be
No one loves you more than me
And no one ever will
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
And when I try to walk away
Youd hurt yourself to make me stay
I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself
As painful as this thing has been
I just cant be with no one else
See I know what we got to do
You let go and Ill let go too
Cause no ones hurt me more than you
And no one ever will
Care for me care for me
I know you care for me
There for me there for me
Said youd be there for me
Cry for me cry for me
You said youd die for me
Give to me give to me
Why wont you live for me
It could all be so simple
But youd rather make it hard
Loving you is like a battle
And we both end up with scars
Tell me who I have to be
No one loves you more than me
And no one ever will
Is this just a silly game
That forces you to act this way
Forces you to scream my name
Then pretend that you cant stay
Tell me who I have to be
No one loves you more than me
And no one ever will
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
And when I try to walk away
Youd hurt yourself to make me stay
I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself
As painful as this thing has been
I just cant be with no one else
See I know what we got to do
You let go and Ill let go too
Cause no ones hurt me more than you
And no one ever will
Care for me care for me
I know you care for me
There for me there for me
Said youd be there for me
Cry for me cry for me
You said youd die for me
Give to me give to me
Why wont you live for me
I treat this like my thesis
Its abuse how I juice up this beat
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it
Like particles while I make international articles
Dont discuss the baby mother business
I been in this third LP you cant tell me I witness
And get flown around the planet
Rock Hard like granite or steel
People feel Lauryn Hill from NewArk to Israel
So I keep makin the streets ballads
While you lookin for dressin to go with your tossed salad
You could get the money
You could get the power
But keep your eyes on the final hour
Now I be breakin bread sippin Manichevitz wine
Pay no mind party like its 1999
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine
Say your rhymes lets see if that get you out your bend
Now Im a get the mozzarella like a Rockerfeller
Still be in the church of Lalibela
Whether posed in Maribella in Couture
Or collectin residuals from off the Score
Ive been here before this aint a battle this is war
I makes a lot like a Sunni
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community
But it aint what you cop
Its about what you keep
And even if there are leaks
you cant capsize this ship
Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip
You could get the money
You could get the power
But keep your eyes on the final hour
Im about to change the focus
From the richest to the brokest
To the lines gonna win it
You gonna fall tryin to ball
While my team win the pennant
Im about to be in it
Make a slum lord be the tenant
Give his money to kids to spend it
Every law that ever prevented
Our survival since our arrival
Things gon change its apparent
And all the transparent gonna
Watch out what you cling to
You can get the green too
Observe how a queen do
And I remain calm readin the 73 Psalm
Cause wit all this on I got the world in palm
You could get the money
You could get the power
But keep your eyes on the final hour
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us
Although them again we will never never never trust
Dem noh know weh dem do dig out yuh yei while dem sticking like glue
Fling skin grin while dem plotting fah you
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Beware the false motives of others
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers
And you never suppose its those who are closest to you to you
They say all the right things to gain their position
Then use your kindness as their ammunition
To shoot you down in the name of ambition they do
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Why every Indian wanna be the chief
Feed a man til hes full and he still want beef
Give me grief try to tief off my piece
Why for you to increase I must decrease
If I treat you kindly does it mean that Im weak
You hear me speak and think I wont take it to the streets
I know enough cats that dont turn the other cheek
But I try to keep it civilized like Menelik
And other African czars observing stars with war scars
Get yours in this capitalistic system
So many caught or got bought you cant list them
How you gonna idolize the missing
To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition
Even when they comin gunnin
Ls known the mission since conception
Lets free the people from deception
If you looking for the answers
Then you gotta ask the questions
And when I let go my voice echoes through the ghetto
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto
Why black people always be the ones to settle
March through these streets like Soweto
Like Cain and Abel Caesar and Brutus Jesus and Judas
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
It took me a little while to discover
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves to themselves
A friend once said and I found to be true
That everyday people they lie to God too
So what makes you think that they wont lie to you
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Gwan like dem love while dem rip yuh to shreds
Trample pon yuh heart and lef yuh fi dead
Dem a yuh fren who yuh depen pon from way back when
But if yuh gi dem yuh back den yuh mus meet yuh end
Dem noh know wey dem do
Dem no know dem no know dem no know
Dem no know dem no know wey dem do
Its funny how money change a situation
My emancipation dont fit your equation
I was on the humble you on every station
Some wan play young Lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston
My ting done made your kingdom wan run
Now understand L Boogies non violent
But if a thing test me run for mi gun
Cant take a threat to mi newborn son
Ls been this way since creation
A groupie call you fall from temptation
Now you wanna ball over separation
Tarnish my image in your conversation
Who you gon scrimmage like you the champion
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
Now now how come your talk turn cold
Gained the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin to grab hold of what you cant control
Now youre all floss what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless now Im on Hope road
Every man want to act like hes exempt
When him need to get down on his knees and repent
Cant slick talk on the day of judgement
Your movements similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight how your whole style bent
Hypocrites always want to play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when its time for punishment
I know that you dont wanna hear my opinion
But there come many paths and you must choose one
And if you dont change then the rain soon come
See you might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you really lost one
You just lost one its so silly how come
When its all done did you really gain from
What you done done its so silly how come
Now dont you understand man universal law
What you throw out comes back to you star
Never underestimate those who you scar
Cause karma karma karma comes back to you hard
You cant hold Gods people back that long
The chain of Shatan wasnt made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some dont know what they have til its gone
Now even when youre gone you can still be reborn
And from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that theyve reached perfection
If you look closely youll see what youve become
Cause you might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you really lost one
You just lost one its so silly how come
When its all done did you really gain from
What you done done it so silly how come
My world it moves so fast today
The past it seems so far away
And life squeezes so tight that I cant breathe
And every time Ive tried to be
What someone else thought of me
So caught up I wasnt able to achieve
But deep in my heart
The answer it was in me
And I made up my mind
To define my own destiny
I look at my environment
And wonder where the fire went
What happened to everything we used to be
I hear so many cry for help
Now I know that His strength is within me
And deep in my heart
the answer it was in me
And I made up my mind
to define my own destiny
And deep in my heart
the answer it was in me
And I made up my mind
to define my own destiny
Now the skies could fall
Not even if my boss should call
The world it seems so very small
Cause nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters at all
See I dont need no alcohol
Your love makes me feel ten feet tall
Without it Id go through withdrawal
Cause nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters at all
These buildings could drift out to sea
Still theres no place Id rather be
Cause nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters to me
Youre part of my identity
I sometimes have the tendency
To look at you religiously
Cause nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters to me
Now you wont find me at no store
I have no time for manicures
With you its never either or
Cause nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters no more
Now my team could score
And make it to the Final Four
Cause nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters no more
Come on baby light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired
Music is supposed to inspire
How come we aint getting no higher
Now tell me your philosophy
On exactly what an artist should be
Should they be someone with prosperity
And no concept of reality
Now who you know without any flaws
That lives above the spiritual laws
And does anything they feel just because
Theres always someone there wholl applaud
Come on baby light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired
Music is supposed to inspire
How come we aint getting no higher
I know you think that youve got it all
And by making other people feel small
Makes you think youre unable to fall
And when you do who you gonna call
See what you give is just what you get
I know it hasnt hit you yet
Now I dont mean to get you upset
But every cause has an effect
Come on baby light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired
Music is supposed to inspire
So how come were not getting no higher
I cross sands in distant lands made plans with the sheiks
Why you beef with freaks as my album sales peak
All I wanted was to sell like 500
And be a ghetto superstar since my first album Blunted
I used to work at Foot Locker they fired me and fronted
Or I quitted now I spit it however do you want it
Writing rhymes my range with the frames slightly tinted
Then send it to your block and have my full name cemented
And if your rhymes sound like mine Im taking a percentage
Unprecedented and still respected when it vintage
Im serious Im taking over areas in Aquarius
Running red lights with my 10000 chariots
Just as Christ was a superstar you stupid star
Theyll hail you then theyll nail you no matter who you are
Theyll make you now then take you down
And make you face it if you slit the bag open
and put your pinky in it then taste it
Come on baby light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired
Music is supposed to inspire
So how come we aint getting no higher
The sweetest thing Ive ever known
Was like the kiss on the collarbone
The way you walk your style of dress
I wish I didnt get so weak
Ooo baby just to hear you speak
Makes me argue just to see
How much youre in love with me
See like a queen a queen upon her throne
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know
I get mad when you walk away dont walk away
So I tell you leave when I mean stay
Warm as the sun dipped in black
Fingertips on the small of my back
More valuable than all I own
Like your precious precious precious precious dark skin tone
Ahbut baby its in vain
Speaking on my mothers phone
The touching makes me think Im grown you aint grown
Sweet prince of the ghetto
Your kisses taste like armoretto
How sad how sad that all things come to an end
But then again Im Im not alone

The answer it was in me
And I made up my mind
To define my own destiny
Unsure of what the balance held
I touched my belly overwhelmed
By what I had been chosen to perform
But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a man child would be born
I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart
Look at your career they said
Lauryn baby use your head
But instead I chose to use my heart
Now the joy of my world is in Zion
Now the joy of my world is in Zion
How beautiful if nothing more
Than to wait at Zions door
Ive never been in love like this before
Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come
See life for you my prince has just begun
And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of his grace

When it hurts so bad when it hurts so bad
Whys it feel so good
When it hurts so bad when it hurts so bad
Whys it feel so good
I loved real real hard once
But the love wasnt returned
Found out the man Id die for
I tried and I tried and I tried
To keep him in my life
I cried and I cried and I cried
But I couldnt make it right
But I I loved the young man
And if youve ever been in love
What you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you dont catch it
If you dont catch it
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it
If you just let it
See I thought this feeling
It was all that I had
But how could this be love
And make me feel so bad
The voodoo youd do yeah
But I I loved the young man
And if youve ever been in love
What you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you dont catch it
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it
See what you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you dont catch it
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it
If you just let it
When it hurts so bad when it hurts so bad
Whys it feel so good
When it hurts so bad when it hurts so bad
Whys it feel so good
When it hurts so bad hurts so bad
let me be patient
let me be kind
ill envy it not
hes all that I got
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him And it will be all right
Tell Him be all right be All right
Now I may have faith
but if i lack love
then i am nothing at all
I can give away
every thing that I possess
but am with out love
then I have no happiness
and not with out sin
but now that im older
all childish things end
Ill never be jealous
And ill wont be to proud
Cuz love is no boastsful
oh and love is not loud
Tell him i need him
tell him i love him tell him
and everything will be alright
Oh oh ohh yeah yaeh all yeah
Now i may have wisdom
but if i speak wrong
oh then what is it worth
See what we now know
to the love that was shown
when our lives were spared
