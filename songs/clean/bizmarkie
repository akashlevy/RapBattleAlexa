Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin to this girl from the US nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin pourin with sweat
I was walkin through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof
I asked her her name she said blahblahblah
She had 910 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said How do you like the show
She said I was very amused
I started throwin bass she started throwin back midrange
But when I sprung the question she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked Do ya have a man she tried to pretend
She said No I dont I only have a friend
Come on Im not even goin for it
This is what Im goin sing
You you got what I need but you say hes just a friend
And you say hes just a friend oh baby
You you got what I need but you say hes just a friend
But you say hes just a friend oh baby
You you got what I need but you say hes just a friend
But you say hes just a friend
So I took blahblahs word for it at this time
I thought just havin a friend couldnt be no crime
Cause I have friends and thats a fact
Like Agnes Agatha Germaine and Jacq
Forget about that lets go into the story
About a girl named blahblahblah that adored me
So we started talkin getttin familiar
Spendin a lot of time so we can build up
A relationship or some understanding
How its gonna be in the future we was plannin
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin
Everytime that I called her it seemed somethin was brewin
I called her room a guy picked up and then I called again
I said Yo who was that Oh hes just a friend
Dont gimme that dont ever gimme that
You you got what I need but you say hes just a friend
And you say hes just a friend oh baby
You you got what I need but you say hes just a friend
But you say hes just a friend oh baby
You you got what I need but you say hes just a friend
But you say hes just a friend
So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitors form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
Yo could you tell me where is door three
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didnt know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh snap Guess what I saw
A fella tonguekissin my girl in the mouth
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I send
Dont ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend
