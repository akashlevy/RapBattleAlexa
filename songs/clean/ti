Automobiellies so pretty but Im Illy though

I went from Smart Car to a bitch with some smart lips
And the FN make my hip limp
Im goin fishin with these little bitty shrimp dips
And my bank roll got a big dip
She gon bring it on a big ship
Quite trill no Quik Trip

Poppin’ bottles with a thick red super model bitch
They may talk a lot of that but they cant do alot of this
Ay Rico told me turn the lights on
So I grab the Audemar and threw the ice on

A lot of niggas rapping ain’t none this raw
They like eh look at TI ballin’ in the VI
Bunch of bad bitches with a looking like Aaliyah
We just pull up hop out
Buy the whole bar pop bottles go hard
This club so packed these hoes so drunk
This club so packed these hoes so drunk
This club so packed these hoes so drunk
I got a bottle got a model got a molly got a blunt
I got a bottle got a model got a molly got a blunt
The club full of bad bitches and they came to play
Okay it must be your hair cause it aint your face
Now if you looking for them bottles and them stacks girl
You make your way up to my section where it’s at girl
Okay do you wanna kick it with a nigga with a meal ticket
Broke nigga looking mad they just gotta deal with it
Get right hoe roll a dice hoe
And oyu aint gotta be a dyke cause you like hoe
But everyday I step behind a wall
I do it big ride fly stunt shine and ball
I got a bunch of money so come and get it from me
And a bucket full of bottles buss it open
If you wanna get drunk
Lil Wayne Verse 3
Ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
Pop that pussy like a gun pull the trigger
Shake that ass like a salt shaker
I keep a L lit up like an elevator
Bitch shake it like a dog hop like a frog ride it like a horse
I throw that dick like darts
Drink all muddy flag all bloody
I’m killin’ these hoes like that nigga Ted Bundy
I’m a good looking rapper I ain’t tryna stunt
Ima fire my blunt like Donald Trump
Where you at hoe Where you at hoe
Can a nigga stick key up in ya back door
And do ya thing in slow motion like Soulja Slim
And come around wipe me down like Boosie dem
That thang up for me show me that you love me
If it’s really too much for you you can bring a couple buddies
Everyday I do my thang big stones and chains
She let me drill all in her mouth no novacane
Them other broke niggas all they did was told ya thangs
I could get ya on that G4 and show ya thangs
I like my women fat ass pretty toes and thing
Long hair dont care as long as none down there
If its manicured I can have fun down there
Take you to whatever club throw some money in the air

Jackers lying say they caught me slipping how could that be

The trap be jumping with that 100 dollar slab
If I wanted I could get 100 on the tab
Sell em all double down do the math

Do it like I wanna do it do it right in front of you
Real vision pimpin I aint seeing none of you
I Do it for my partner phil daughter and his momma too
Do it for my oldest sons and they Grand momma too
Do it for my daughters and my youngest son momma who

Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long

The old me is dead and gone dead and gone eeyy
Ever had one of dem days u wish woulda stayd home
Run into a group of nias getting they hate on
U walk by they get wrong u reply then sht get blown
Way outta proportion way past discussion
Just u against them pick one then rush em
Figure youd get jumped hell thats nothing
They dont wanna stop there now they bussin
Now u gushin ambulance rushin u to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus ya hit 4 times plus it hit ya spine paralyzed waist down now ya wheel chair bound
Nevermind that now u lucky to be alive Just think it all started u fussin with 3 guys
Now ya pride in the way but ya pride is the way u could uck around get shot die anyday
Nias die every day all over bull sht dope money dice game ordinary hood sht
Could this be cuz of hip hop music or did the ones with the good sense not use it
Usually nias dont kno what to do when their back against the wall so they just start shootin
For red or for blue or for blo I guess from Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress now im straight now I get it now I take
Time to think before I make mistakes just for my familys sake
That part of me left yesterday the heart of me is strong today
No regrets im blessed to say the old me dead and gone away
Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone dead and gone
Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone eeyy
I aint never been scared I lived through tragic
Situations coulda been dead lookin back at it
Most of that sht didnt even have to happen
But u dont think about it when u out there trappin
In apartments hangin smokin and rappin
Nias start sht didnt next thing ya kno we cappin
Get locked up then didnt even get mad
Now think about damn what a life I had
Most of that sht look back just laugh
Some sht still look back just sad
Maybe my homboy still be around
Had I not hit the nia in the mouth that time
I won that fight I lost that war
I can still see my nia walkin out that door
Whoda thought Id never see Philant no more
Got enough dead homies I dont want no more
Cost a nia his job cost me more
Ida took that asswhoopin now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A nia put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there talk sht all night
Cuz I hit you you sue me
I shoot you get locked up who me
No more stress now im straight now I get it now I take
Time to think before I make mistakes just for my familys sake
That part of me left yesterday the heart of me is strong today
No regrets im blessed to say the old me dead and gone away
Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long

The old me is dead and gone dead and gone dead and gone
Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone eeyy
I turn my head to the east I dont see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the east I dont see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north swallow that pill that they call pride

Hey yo this for all my homegirls like to see a baller do his thing
Get ya shit together come on
All the eight nines and dimes
Id like to welcome yall to the best time of ya life
All the stones is real
And its all chrome on the wheels ya know
Pull up to the club lift both doors up
Hopped out clean and yo ho chose us
Walked in the door make the show hold up
Cause my neck and my bracelet is so froze up
The kind of stones bitches wanna see close up
So we dont appraoch them they come and appraoch us
Roll the dro up then go post up
Look down with the west fixin go sho nuff
In the VIP and all eyes on us
Hoes chill poppin pills blowin dro no dust
What cha say got a man so what

Ya think ya fixin be thinkin bout him no sir
Probably prefer to tel ya man good night
Unless you dont wanna know what the good life look like
Hook Lil Kim TI
If you aint gettin money good night

Boy them diamonds aint real get ya shit together
Now we can ball seven days six nights
If tht head and that pussy hit right
Hey match ya panties with ya bras get ya shit together
Go get ya hair and nails done get ya shit together
Hey Im off the scene with Louis the thirteenth
Chains swings to my jeans and my Tshirt clean
In case you been researching Im the King
With a style as mean as the Earth seem
Chest on ice and my wrist on gleam
30 karats in the ring money aint no thing
You think Im playin but I aint joking
The dro king if it aint purple I aint smoking
Rubberband bank rolls fifty thousand dollar cheddar knots
Try to shine is you out your mind boy you better not
I walk around with more money than you ever got
Shrewd attitude like I never had to sell a rock
Shawty I can get you in whatever spot
Backstage front row what I got to front for
Im getting bored dont even know what I stunt for
Got a lot of rides what it hurt to cop one more
Hook Lil Kim TI
To all my hot girls if you wanna come chill
Or roll on chrome wheels let me tell you what it is
We fixin throw a little party at the crib
Where the floors tricked out and the rooms like ill
The basements cool but the pools unreal
Where that millionaire lives shit remains concealled
So pop a pill put on your blindfold
Im hitting the dance floor and grab eightynine more
Let em know we on the way where they been trying to go
I knew I had em when they asked me What kind of diamonds are those
Headed to the spot pouring double shots of XO
Play the Love Below ane watchem undress slow
Flicks on the flat screen make em want to Get Low
And spit shine this dick of mine until it gets swole
When they kick it with the king they dont wanna let go
So whatcha gonna tell a nigga when he tell ya Lets Go

Chorus Keri Hilson TI
I got your back boy
but I promise I will never let you go
said I got I got I got I got your back boy
I got I got I got I got your back boy
I know you got my back right
keep it looking good for ya
keep it looking hood for ya
shawty if you don’t know
I got I got I got I got your back boy
yes Valentino blouses summer houses cash check
you can get it you deserve it flawless diamonds Louie purses
my mission’s to purchase Earth for her
present the gifts without the curse
her pleasure is my purpose
pleasure to be at your service
front row at fashion shows as well as Sunday morning service
but better days or for worse
if I’m paid I’m hurting in my pocket
she still got a ngga back that’s for sure
no matter what may occur in life
everyday with her is like a plus
I’mma love her til she be like that’s enough
pop a bottle get a couple wine glasses fill em up and lift em up
let us toast to the future here’s to us
They wonder how we do what we do
Panamera Porsches me and you
stuck to your side like like like glue
be by your side whatever your gonna do
This is for the women who man caught a sentence
who gon be there for a minute but they didn’t keep their distance
they stayed home waiting on the phone
and on visit day show up looking good smelling better playing kissy face
just wanna let you know we appreciate
everything you do for us on a day to day
and I know we don’t show you all the time but we lucky that you ours
no bouquet of flowers could ever show how much we know we need you
we do all that’s in our power just to please you
see boo fck them girls I would leave the World ‘fore I leave you
may God say even now …
even though them chicks be hating on us
still I’m gonna keep her by my side
In whatever situation we gon ride
make all my fantasies come alive
I’ll be … as long as your gon be beside me
10 million dollar mansions won’t suffice
if you ain’t gon be in there with me at night
the pieces to my puzzle’s in my life
with all of my good days and all of my bad
you stood by your man and you know you got my back
worth every car every bag with me they wanna be that
I know what I got at home
I ain’t never gon leave that
them btches best believe that
Aye have you ever loved somebody so much you cant stand it but cant do without em
Do anything for em cause you truly do adore em
Like dedicate songs write poems
But they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore em
But you feel like they feel like you aint right for em
Between being with em forever leaving em never
But it seem like you argue and fighting over whatever
Maybe we can leave find someone better
Even though you will you never known none better
My heart says nah she cant leave wont let her
Been head over heels since the very day I met her
Fell so deep in love I aint been able to get up
Sometimes I want some peace of mind and she dont shut up
Love her to death dont know whether to kiss her or kill her
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
Even love couldnt save us
On a bed of guns and roses
And we dont know which one to choose
But either way were gonna lose
Even love couldnt save us
On a bed of guns and roses
Hah I guess Id rather suffer with her than be miserable without her
I buy alot of Prada Gucci and Belinciaga
To keep her content and keep down the nonsense
But every corner we turn around the conflict
Mostly dumb shit like who she run with
Where the fuck have you been Them pants – they dont fit
Really honestly speaking some things I dont get
No matter how much she try she cant make it make more sense
Therefore here we go again
Screaming yelling at the top of our lungs she going in
Seeing the kind of shit I be like if you was a man
I would go in your shit real no shit
But I love her so much that I cant forget
That the feel of a kiss it could heal when Im sick
Still I dont like to feel like this
If I wouldnt miss her I would probably to get a kill right here
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
Even love couldnt save us
On a bed of guns and roses
And we dont know which one to choose
But either way were gonna lose
Even love couldnt save us
On a bed of guns and roses
Every time we say our goodbyes
A little piece of my heart breaks off inside
I dont really ever know why
If I could live without you Id try
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
Even love couldnt save us
On a bed of guns and roses
And we dont know which one to choose
When either way were gonna lose
Even love couldnt save us
On a bed of guns and rosesLyrics submitted by lee
It’s the king representing once more you understand When people see me on Bankhead man on four star point yelling screaming and waving I don’t wanna roll over no toes in my Rolls You just back up let a pimp pass through you dig
Baby better double arthur burger
Every time I see shorty
Selling out arenas chasing asses like Serena
Shorty live a hell of a life
I’m shining in and out of foreign
Cash steady flowing they got shorty where you goin
People see me they ask me shorty where you goin
Partners see me they ask meshorty where you goin
Shorty goin extra hard when they release his passport
Why I need a credit card what you think this cash for
Hit the dealership and give them every dime he ask for
Just so I can see 260 on the gas board
Trying to get some luck somebody better get the task force
Love when hoes love me let me fuck em til their ass hoarse
Pimpin 101 just come and see me take a crash course
You wanna count my money go to college need a math course
On a main dashboard 100 milligramy
Breakneck speed til I see a billi coming
I’m building jimi hendrix good grumbling in my stomach
I’m still stunting off the chain chasing niggas for my money
Pair of poodles ike I’m playing gin rummy
No cards just broads when a nigga get hard
Love the offshore autobahn tar like a car star
Put it in her wristwatch
Balling like a big shot
Baby better double arthur burger
Every time I see shorty
Selling out arenas chasing asses like Serena
Shorty live a hell of a lifeLyrics submitted by chantel
I still love you my love
I still need you my heart
I love you honey bunny
you are the only one believe me
and I hope I be the only one for you
I still love you I still need you
Yes Ive done something wrong
and Im so sorry about that
Im so sorry about everything
Forgive me I thought youd always be mine
I thought I could never lose you
but now I know I feel I believe
theres an other guy
you love an other heart in your mind
that I could lose you now
that I could see you
with an other person in your arms
oh help me my god
tell me that Im wrong
tell me that this is not the truth
Do you still love me
do you still need me
do you still know that Im here for you
if you need me too
CHORUS repeatsLyrics submitted by Bobby
I never let you down I’ma shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off mine alright
Hard Imma ball on them squares I float
Quarter million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may see it might be
But no matter what they doing they don’t do it like me
Like a G I hold it down for the town I’m at
And I flash like that
Strike a match catch a fire
Any moment I decide thats enough of all your lies
Noy your buzz just died
Step inside super fly to the shoes in their coupe
Then exit out with all the btches like we always do
My desire to retire growing every new coupe
Cause these guys just don’t ride like mi ngga you too
Tight jeans funny hair cuz dancing on the screen
It’s about the real nggas in the game so it seems
Just pretending holla pimpin get a sht a black eye eye
Next he say he trapping in my head I’m like why
Be yourself you aint gotta pimp on in your body
I can tell ya aint never bought a key or caught a body
Ngga probably just seen Wayne Gucci Mane Me and Boosie all go to prison
And they flip their whole image ngga tripping
Listen do for you that aint in the cars
Think the power is in your gun but over all it’s in your heart
Nowadays I don’t know wassup with nggas in the A
Guess he think he in the game but he really in the way
Violating I was having conversations in the joint
But guess who done it and I promised I would put you on point
I’m disappointed in you dog you aint hold it down at all
But I aint going in your jaw just gon show ya how to ball
Standin tall thru the storm on the yard or in the dorm
Cats in prison who expecting me to represent for em
I never let you down I’ma shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off mine alright
Hard Imma ball on them squares I float

Quarter million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may see it might be
But no matter what they doing they don’t do it like me
Like a G I hold it down for the town I’m at
And I flash like that
Strike a match catch a fire
Catch a fire see TI add gas
Whats a molotov cocktail to never break a glass
Scary ass ngga wanna come for me you better bring it
I ain’t mad I forgive em God I know they aint mean it
Yeah I seen it all before hey I’m popping and they ain’t
Rack they brain try to think how to stop it and they can’t
Ain’t that lame but then that hatred manifest to pure malice
I’m no longer being callous so I’m gon let you nggas have it
Won’t be satifsied till somebody dies and Im patient
Waiting on me and the reaper on a first name basis now
I’mma let you make it now stay totally out the way for you
But know that we can take it any place you wanna take it to
Hating in your blood cuz guess it’s just too late for you
All I could do is pray for you or organise a wake for you
Your choice clearly I aint hearing your voice
Keep it up and I’m gon send your ass to
Hey you can the bottom partner Im gon bring the sky box
I got sht locked down ngga why stop now
Im so above you hover over suckers why drop down
I’m so profound its goes down and I never let you down…
I never let you down I’ma shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off mine alright
Hard Imma ball on them squares I float
Quarter million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may see it might be
But no matter what they doing they don’t do it like me
Like a G I hold it down for the town I’m at
And I flash like that
Strike a match catch a fire
Rappin for the hell of it
Hella rich never have to sell a brick again
Must I tell a bitch again
The Bullshit Im addressing check Im on some next level shit
Never been fucked in the game Im celibate
Barely out the ghetto with
One foot out and one foot in intelligent as fellas get
Be clear I could fall back seven years
Still aint no one ahead of me
Consider it a blessing if you get to stand next to me
Stack that cash like the US Treasury
Every single thing I ever done was done heavily
Still aint no catching me
Put it on my pops Big Phil Aunt Beverly
Be standing on the top still after they bury me
Nose in the air so stuck up arrogant
Aint got long hot songs best cherish it
Whoever drop mine thats over finito
You paying for your foul like a freethrow
Now how could a nigga think that he could see me
Other than the magazine covers or the TV
You know I sold more mixtapes than your cd
You’re waiting on your big break praying you can beat me
You aint made it far as DC on the low
I been all around the globe like a god how they treat me
Broads hit they knees eyes closed when they greet me
Mouth wide open just begging me to skeet skeet
You in a deep sleep stop dreaming
Im 6 albums in for 10 years I been firin hot semen
The limelights mine Im gleaming
Thats why I say Im King bitch
All on my mind is to get more millies
Niggas talk shit thats silly
Shawty he aint about that
Tell em get lost I’m busy really
Where niggas get off piss off
Me and mine oughta take time to pop a lid off
Shit all over the way bouncing me is yall
Seeing your fucking mind you figuring Ima fizz off
Never cooled off Tip scorching
Minimal injury though they wishing me maximum misfortune
Everybody think you stink like horse shit
House full of chicks on some girl next door shit
A king go on sell 30 mil out the store quit
Of course this case lost all my endorsements
Tripled up on real estate still buying more shit
But Tip bankrupt according to your sources
Im still caked up along with more reinforcements
Tore shit up from the ladder to the rooftops
Officially the hottest nigga rapping since Tupac
Before you rap bout me best ask bout me
Im out my fucking mind need counseling
Please dont doubt me trust me
Its all fun and games till somebody start busting
Remember my discussion when rappers be battling
I find out about it better get to skedaddling
Pack your family’s bags move em out to Seattle
You ever crawl back youll need an ambulance and bandages
Live life glamorous so extravagant
Hip hop champion for real though
You couldn’t fuck with me with a Brazil hoe nigga
All on my mind is to get more millies
Niggas talk shit thats silly
Shawty he aint about that
Tell em get lost I’m busy really
Nigga Im illyLyrics submitted by young
A little closer to the keyboard
Its hard to read between your lines
We were the clock hands at midnight
Now youre four whole hours behind
A little closer to the keyboard
I cant quite see the whites of your eyes
Though you bat your eyelids from across the ocean
And I fall over in their breeze
I dont bring you spices from the East
And I dont bring you the worlds you crave
cause everyday you need a new one
A little closer to the keyboard
We pass light bits in the night
Though you send your flare to the horizon
I just stare and blink in your light
No I dont speak in all your tongues
So I dont even know if Ill be welcome
What if I appeared as if by magic
Just like in Mr Benn
So go if youre going
You keep pouring when I say when
Come home when your work there is done
A little closer to the keyboard
Its hard to read between your lines
We were the clock hands at midnight
Now youre four whole hours behindLyrics submitted by Brightone

cope with all three you kno what Im saying I feel like the only thing havent done die you knoJust

goes around comes back you knoSo when I die I hope I love in the skyAll my folk who aint survive may

My cousin Toot aint have to die right in front of his son and his wife
He lost his life struggling over a gun
give a damn what he done that my muthafuckin folk and I love that nigga til death no muthafuckin joke
I can feel my eyes feelin the lord is my witness
If I catch em Imma kill em I made it my bizness
back in the day you stayed in my bizness taught I didnt have to corporate yay in my bizness
coincedently thats why today you not wit me
my cousin died ova some yay and I miss em
plus he had his family out lets say she the eye witness
but her boyfriend did the shooting judge gave her life sentence
I heard that now Im dressed up in all black
shot up the whole apartments and still and brought back
the best friend I had in Jamel I lost that
I guess your death was a lesson in life it taught me that
Who ever seen a nigga go to jail sleep til day two
well thats how sick I was when Jay blew
the hard way that whating pour they was tooting
overdosed on heroin died at 22
If you aint heard about
daughter she smile just like you

and I got 4 myself yep its been a few
now everything I do is for
lord they all I got so please dont take em from me

dough and a little crack
never could apolygize cause you died thats why they saying
I bet you niggas thinking that I living it up
til you see polices laughing as they pickin me up
Went from seeing how many bitches i can fit in the truck
to 3 hots and a cot is you kidding or what fuck how
many millions I got nigga so what if Im hot when I got prices on my head
Feds rushing my spot a million
haters wont me dead force to carry me gat
but you a seven time felon wat you doing with dat
22 either you lose or lose
Thats the way the game structured for real niggas to suffer
been a busta alway stood on my feet
like a man prepared to take what ever coming for me
or polices wit a warrant for me
Im a G prepared to die for whats important to me
eye who say they want it wit me
put up the house and bet the odds if coming from me
OGs say I need to
you telling me wit these seven years of probation
pistol charges and a host of
if niggas only knew the kind of time I was facing
I tried to keep to myself but
sometime I couldnt take it
got 4 kids wit smiles on they faces
mean more to me than my crown and my braclet
take that away from me and my life is butt naked

Youre gonna be a shining star in fancy clothes and fancy carars

Just living my life Ay my life Oh my life Ay my lifeOh

Nevermind what haters say ignore them til they fade away
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
Youd still be wasting days away not had I never saved the day
Consider them my protégé homage I think they should pay
Instead of being gracious they violate in a major way
I never been a hater still I love them in a crazy way
Some say they sold yay and no they couldnt get work on Labor day
It aint that black or white their hands in areas the shade of grey
Im West side anyway even if I left today and stayed away
Some move away to make a way not move away cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away
I pray for patience but they make me want to melt their face away
Like I once made them spray now I could make em put the ks away
Been thuggin all my life cant say I dont deserve to take a break
If you ever see me catch a case and watch my future fade away
Youre gonna be a shining star in fancy clothes and fancy carars
And then youll see youre gonna go far
Cause everyone knows just who you areare
So live your life Ay ay ay ay
You steady chasing that paper
Just live your life Oh ay ay ay
You got no time for no hatas

No telling where itll take ya
Just live your life Oh ay ay ay
Cause Im a paper chaser
Just living my life
Im the opposite of moderate immaculately polished with the spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid
Allergic to the counterfeit impartial to the politics
Articulate but still Id grab a nigga by the collar quick
Whoever having problems with their record sales just holla tip
If that dont work and all else fails then turn around and follow tip
I got love for the game but ay Im not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame and the rappers nowadays are comedy
The hootin and the hollerin back and forth with the arguing
Where you from who you know what you make and what kind of car you in
Seems as though you lost sight of whats important when depositing them checks into your bank account and you up out of poverty
Your values is in disarray prioritizing horribly
Unhappy with the riches cause you piss poor morally
Ignoring all prior advice and fore warning
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden arent we
Youre gonna be a shining star in fancy clothes and fancy carars
And then youll see youre gonna go far
Cause everyone knows just who you areare
So live your life Ay ay ay ay
You steady chasing that paper
Just live your life Oh ay ay ay
You got no time for no hatas
Just live your life Ay ay ay ay
No telling where itll take ya
Just live your life Oh ay ay ay
Cause Im a paper chaser
Just living my life Ay my life Oh my life Ay my lifeOh

Them busters cowards though and I’ll take a bullet for you
Mansions jewelry all I need is for you and me to have some understanding
Have a couple candid conversations
Your frustrations I take in consideration
I’m rough around the edges dont bat with me and be patient
And you’re sadly mistaken if you think I’m into chasing

You watch it while I live it live it

Just here for your amusement
You watch it while I live it live it
You waitin for me to lose it
I guess Im just here for your amusement
The price of fame I think I paid want my change I done gave
Errything in my possession for my seconds on the stage
For my name up in lights and multimillion record sales
I done gave up my life cant get a moment to myself
When alone I ask myself is it worth it I aint perfect
Neither is anybody else but I think my kids deserve
To be with Daddy out in public without all the interruptions
When the lies and gossips published Im the topic of discussion
And I stay in trouble just to show these suckers I aint lost it
And Id do it all again thats the funny thing about it
I aint playing boy Im bout it
Will I change boy I doubt it
I done been a lot of things I aint never been a coward
See the paparazzi crowded all around me now
Same niggas who was dissin want a pound like Im C now
Showered with support from my adoring fans
They hear TIs arrested theyre like here we go again
You watch it while I live it live it
I walk they follow ay
I talk they holla ay
Just here for your amusement
You watch it while I live it live it
You waitin for me to lose it
I guess Im just here for your amusement
Ay Youve seen it all before guys know how the story goes
Its like 2Pac never died sit back enjoy the show
You see the shit that scares you senseless I done lived through it
Knew the risks and the consequences and I still do it
And then Im so fresh them niggas mildew it
Not just a actor by profession pimp I live movies
Thats why they whisper when they see me point and stare at me
Cause they just wanna live through me vicariously
Fashion weekend Paris week party like a rockstar
Get blown by a top model til she catch lockjaw
Got the dough you get a year stashed in my sock drawer
Showed you the troubles and the struggles of an outlaw
Top dog would not fall I am not yall
Couple pages out the calendar and Im out yall
Kid listen pay attention you dont wanna be me
Its safer to watch it on TV
You watch it while I live it live it
I walk they follow ay
I talk they holla ay
Just here for your amusement
You watch it while I live it live it
You waitin for me to lose it
I guess Im just here for your amusement
See I dont think it would even matter to me
Woking a nine to five would it be better
I mean be honest would you care to gossip about me
I guess thats just the way that it goes the way that it goes
Cause I know See I can be somewhere out keeping it cool
And get told Almost anything instead of the truth
Yall know more than I do its breaking news to me too
Easy killer yall know that aint how I move ooh
He said and she said what I did what with they who
No not me I said not me she gave me no head ooh
Wont get me again hey I pleaded the fifth hey
I know better than to ever talk during the film
In and flashing lights can blind your eyesight
To when you cant see whats wrong from right
Well shorty til you walk a mile in my shoes
And understand this is who I am
Life can be such a blur obviously we prefer
Our privacy but instead we endure
Yes sir dont expect nothin less of me
Cause this goin probably be this way until the death of me
But for the hustle and the lady on my arm now
Plus all my kids and my moms Im a calm down
And yo we doin just fine and the times just flyin
Live one headline at a time

Told me she can write this shit

So she give me brain getting head on the scooter
Had sex on the beach

But I’m looking for a cute bitch

let me go im on my path let me go My mama loved me
more than i do she said your pop was jus like you
trapped in a vicious cirlce Jesus youngest disciple tell
the judge if he throwed the book at me make it the bible
Start calling myself the king for lack of a better title
Loyal beyond belief to my detriment its so vital I
change or blow opportunities like a choir recital Now
while I do not care who telling meanwhile selling powder
puts food in the bellies Well its unfortunate the orphanage
couldnt keep up the mortages
Kid go to school stupid they teachers ignoring it sorta just
doomed forced into being a goon selling kush in a jar
mixing guitar and the volume Consumed with the same way
of life I left everything i know now learned by myself all you
see is the wealth the Maseratis Ferraris So dont sympathise
dont nobody feel sorry no mercy
Everybodys standing and waiting chanting and hating Gospels
say they should forgive me they rather hand me to satan
blatant displays the day of hypocrisy boy you got to be
kidding could it possibly be second coming of Pac is me
Remember that when he was there and when he died
you realised you need him here
God with me partner aint no one for me to fear hindsight
2020 future not as clear but Im a rider til I die put bullets
tween my eye Hide your S I can make my peace with God
and say goodbye fuck up the world like Lady Di on the day
he died His wife and sons and daughters know that everyday
he tried to be a better person all they want is better verses
They could market to the merchants but when they closed curtains
aye you could be for certain aint nobody perfect but when
your rich nobody gives a shit no mercy
i used to dream i used to dream oh whoah
about the money and the cars and girls and the girls
but now i sing now i sing oh whoah
because im sitting on top of the world the whole world
and now i sing sing sing sing cause im sitting on top of the world
and now i sing sing sing sing sitting on top of the world
man i remember before i say that wait let me issue this statement
no way should reflection be mistaking for glorification
now i remember so vivid me and my niggas was living
substandard condition still handling business
still laughing and tripping still having the bitches
im rapping now reminiscing and god damn it we did it
from trapping standing and pitching with rich we stand in the kitchen
splitting it eight ways flipping it 8 days
thought that while in a room it was just the way to behave
kept the weight and the yey for most the paper we made in all dimes
i aint lieing the pleasure was all mine
have big work to move but we served the small time
i always outshined the niggas with small minds
who would of thought we would be arguably the greatest of all time
around here we developed such a sound down here
but duplicate it off the steel it can only be found here
only listen to gs that other shit i dont hear
shit they so far in the rear how would i even care
im too busy being a player staring at niggas careers
but talk about it for years and now we finally here
i used to dream i used to dream oh whoah
about the money and the cars and girls and the girls
but now i sing now i sing oh whoah
because im sitting on top of the world the whole world
and now i sing sing sing sing cause im sitting on top of the world
and now i sing sing sing sing sitting on top of the world
they say what goes up must come down but i aint reached my cruising altitude
take a look at what i did but can you imagine what im about to do
the places im bout to go and the money im bout to see
gave bill gates some binoculaurs and said look out for me
and see these expectations even at def jam
cause i married the streets and atlanta has been my best man
my momma quit her job and now she works with six figures
cause im a selfmade nappyheaded rich nigga
private planes help me travel in peace
to four cities in one day and four countries in one week
cause i work for myself and no one else cause im too smart too
put one of my partners right through culinary art school
now he my personal chef so that bread he get it
put them all in houses cleaned up all of my friends credit
and now they witness all the glitz and the glamour
catch us eating at straits atlanta with women with table manners
order in singapore and lobster
celebrating coming from nothing to winning grammys and rappers winning oscars
and they say rappers shouldnt act nahh suckers
we see samuel jackson like whats up mother fuckerrr
On Top Of The World Lyrics On httpwwwelyricsworldcom
i know them haters dont stop plotting and wish you would fall
cause im standing on top looking down at it all
i see you down there to yall this aint like i got it all
homie i aint get enough im still trying to triple up
so all we got is street cred and a cool building up
say im doing too much shit i say i aint did enough
remember saying damn if i could just get to a million plus
and now im like shit what the fuck is a million bucks
triple that on my bun thanks to bigs and run
but nevermind what ive been through just look at what i become
all the shit ive avoided what i done for my sons
hand dollars and momma just call her
i sold dope and dropped out of school seems its all they can see
they dont notice none of my family did that since me
i broke that cycle now my family live a life of
mandatory minimals but not when the judge sentence them
cousins in college where you think they get tuition from
jeffrey standing around wishing huh
and while you standing around looking dumb
i make it happen taking action over time got damn good at it
i used to dream i used to dream oh whoah
about the money and the cars and girls and the girls
but now i sing now i sing oh whoah
because im sitting on top of the world the whole world

Dont do no business until you check his paperwork
And if all else fails I just hope that this paperwork
Wanna swing Bentley doors blow smoke through the roof
Everything got a cost they gone need something on you
ATL Westside thats the only home I know
In 85 me and Uncle Quint used to ride around in the big Bronco
Took me up to Charles Disco
Daytime set me down at the bar
Where I drank Shirley Temple
Till he walked out with a bag and we got back in the car
What you wanna be he asked When you grow up big head
I just wanna be like you ridin round town gettin bread
We shared a couple laughs couple summer pass
Uncle Quint aint nowhere to be found
Later we learn that someone ratted him out
For that reason 10 years he wont be around
Dont do no business until you check his paperwork
And if all else fails I just hope that this paperwork
Wanna swing Bentley doors blow smoke through the roof
Everything got a cost they gone need something on you
Im the only man I see
Fresh up off the porch
Lookin for a drop Porsche and a fake ID
Introduce me to the crack game
Rap game was the furthest from my mind
Had a notebook full of rhymes
And a pocket full of crack rock dimes
Time on my side lil 45 in my jeans
Open fire if you seem to be blocking my dreams yessir
Section 8 me and Ma lived in the trap
I said fuck school it holdin me back
I wanna bankroll chasin after that
Dont do no business until you check his paperwork
And if all else fails I just hope that this paperwork
Wanna swing Bentley doors blow smoke through the roof
Everything got a cost they gone need something on you
Look at me at 17
Livin on my own peddlin
Quarter ki now and then sellin weed
Totin tools caughtt my first felony
Thats one of many that were to follow
Drinkin Henney up out the bottle
Tote a choppa I think Im bein followed
Family dont think Ill live to see tomorrow
Plenty have a story like mine
Know many of you had a little nine
Know many of you did a little dirt
Too many of us did a little time
Wake up 10 years of your life passed
When you get your cake up
Dont it seem lil odd
When the Feds on your ass passin out
Dont do no business until you check his paperwork
And if all else fails I just hope that this paperwork
Wanna swing Bentley doors blow smoke through the roof
Everything got a cost they gone need something on you
If you think that you high baby look above you
Its drones in the sky theres nothing you could do
So left two three snap
Dont get serious now its too late for that
Time on my side lil 45 in my jean
Open fire if you seem to be blocking my dreams yessir
Dont do no business until you check his paperwork
And if all else fails I just hope that this paperwork
Wanna swing Bentley doors blow smoke through the roof
Everything got a cost they gone need something on you
Is it just me or you got too much ass in them jeans
I been watchin’ you a while now
And i just wanna find a way to make you smile now
Why you blushing forget about them other guys now
I know you aint trying to tell me that you shy now
I realize that youre beauty could intimidate
Them suckers you aint got no business for them anyway
With such a pretty face big booty little waistline
I wanna grab from behind to the bass line
Have a great time pull yourself a shot girl
Chase it with the lime now you feeling like a hot girl
I know you’re probably used to deal with them wannabe’s
But honestly I gotta say im who they wanna be
I promise all I wanna see is you up under me
Now we can disappear whenever when you wanna leave
I could guarantee the ride of your life
Any fantasies on your mind we can try them tonight
Oh yeah sitting here im looking at you like that
We sippin’ on patron something’s on my mind you wanna leave with me tonight

Oh girl I wonder for real shawty let me tell you what I’m thinking ‘bout
It’s the end of the night and I’m thinking you might
Wanna leave the bar park the car turn into a porn star
Yes I’d love to hear about your interests
I gotta say your intellect got me impressed
See youre panty’s do your dress like a silhouettelook at that
Patrone got me thinking sex did you feelin’ that
All due respect though a simple yes no
Hey let yourself let go shawty let’s go let’s go
Pull you to the crib get you to the dress show
Kiss you from your pretty lips till you red toes
I’m thinking it’s the end of the night
Hey you could leave with your friend if you like
But I’m saying no I’m saying no
Hey we could ride out
I wanna see you satisfied inside out
Once I’m in you aint gon’ want me to slide out
You tell your girlfriends they gon’ wanna try out

Wanna leave the bar park the car turn into a porn star
Could youplay with it with your tongue just alittle
You such a sexy individual physical and mental
And if it’s sentimental shouldn’t rules bend a little
Hey let me start at the top stop in the middle use a popsicle
Make you shiver giggle when it tickle
I could talk to you dirty if you’d like that bad girl
I finish once hit a blunt start right back
I know you told me you a good girl
But shawty you’s grown woman not a little girl
You could blame it on the patron or the champagne
But sometimes being bad could be a good thing
Oh yeah sitting here im looking at you like that
We sippin’ on patron something’s on my mind you wanna leave with me tonight
It’s been killing me all night long and I wondermisses shawty let me tell you what I’m thinking ‘bout
Oh girl I wonder for real shawty let me tell you what im thinking ‘bout
It’s the end of the night and I’m thinking you might
Wanna leave the bar park the car turn into a porn star

Wit the soul of a old man
Im shell shocked get shot
With the glock on patrol man
Im just lookin for that dro man
For ma niggas slangin blow pimpin hos
Let these other niggas know
Chorus 2xLyrics submitted by Kathy
When I think about all my time and all my struggle
Through all my grinding and all my troubles
Man I came up from nothing all I had was a hustle
with a blindfold trying to find pieces to the puzzle no muzzle
I tell it like it is thats that
Right or wrong Ima call it like I see it dont forget
That impossible is nothing your environments irrelavant
just dont let your emotions overpower your intelligence
Refuse to give up your mistakes dont define you
they dont dictate where your headed they remind you
The Time keep ticking let your mind keep clicking
Never stop thinking be aware of your positions
Be aware of the collisions and the potholes sitting
on the road that you travel on your life long mission
just listen every day is like a snapshot taken
if you live you can learn to be patient
Cuz life is like a slideshow
all the places that I go
and I the things that I know
through all the highs and low
Cuz life is like a slideshow
All things that Ive seen
and all the things that Ive dreamed
you cant take away from me
cuz life is like a slideshow
As I look back at a fly young cat
who could rap with a dream look where I took that
Beginning on Bankhead then it spread out
vision in my head all I had to was get it out
when I walked out of my house and looked at my street
All I seen was opportunity that led me to truency
I aint really have a role model to infleunce me
Uncle Quinn in prison they say next its going be you in it
As I juvenile caught cases so fluently
Look at my life and learn from it dont do it
if I only knew back then what I know now
how much better life would of been if Ida slowed down
Maybe Ida been Kanye instead of seeing Gunplay
But God got a plan Ill understand one day
But one day of life like a snapshot taken
Just believe you can make it have faith be patient
Looking back on my lifetime
see the slides go by sometimes I wonder why
looking back on where Ive been
do you remember thenLyrics submitted by Leandra
My cup runneth over with pinot grigio hold up
You bogus in the lambo if you aint lifting the door up
You bogus popping pills if you aint picking the ho up
You bogus running out on your kids my nigga grow up
For Gods sake like a wedding cutting large cake
For large stakes let the hammer bang broad day
Aye nevermind what the blogs say
This what my mind and my heart say
My philosophy profit off of my properties
Get it flip it we got to be rich that broke shit is obsolete
Possibly off of my rocker watch how you watching me
Sophisticated psychotic fly as a pilot
Officially silent all you wish you could get I got it
Unlimited titanium nigga whats in yo wallet
Out of gladiator college I made it summa cum laude
While you clowns couldnt have got a cap and gown if you bought it
I parlay with Saudis buying crude oil and diamonds
Hustle January July fly to Dubai
A broke nigga telling me about how Im dividing the pies
Like a blind nigga telling me its an eye for an eye
Bullheaded and stubborn I be that way until I die
But find a nigga with more hustle then me I dare you to try
And according to the hand on my Audemar
Its my time to shine so fück yall
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
The fact is you cant please everybody
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
I grew up in the gutter life a motherfücker
I get that why I dont trust a motherfücker
Seen a nigga snitch on they mom shoot at they brother
Go to prison in love with a bítch and a nigga fück her
I seen real Gs destroyed by real suckers
Innocent ladies raped and defenseless babies abducted
Such a horrible truth but you see it over and over
Its nothing get numb to it and your heart grow colder
Pacify your pain with a chain and a Rover
Fück it justify your action with stacking your dough up
You show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda
Just enough for me to blow up nigga hold up
Switch the flow up cause these niggas be snitching so much
I promise all they missings the badge coffee and doughnut
Go to jail so what never see my integrity perish
That aint the Harris way study my pedigree
Promise Im one of the only ones who keep it 100
Probably why I think they all out to get me you cant convince me
Large money and fame will plant seeds of envy
To make my partners resent me enough to come and get me
Catch me slipping and hit me just like they did 50
Cause Im in the position that he think he should be given
Listen dawg the fact of the matter is
Im on a narrow path and we all cant travel
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
The fact is you cant please everybody
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
What it aint What it is Even if you gotta live
I learned that apartment is way more exciting than a big ass house on a hill
I used to be a way better writer and a rapper
When I used to want a black Karmann Ghia
Now a nigga speeding in a Porsche
Feeling like Im going off a course cut these fück niggas off
Nigga TIP in my life scream that till Im horse
Duck these get the fück off me projectiles bítch you aint really got a choice
Im living my life live yours wwwelitericscom
I dont even like rapping fast but thats how the world come to me
Talk to me sideways nigga thats your ass
Slow it down this that shit thatll make you call your momma
Say hey Im sorry for begging for all them clothes you couldnt afford
And this the type of shit thatll make you call your rap partner
And say Im sorry Im awkward my fault for fücking up the tours
I hated all the attention so I ran from it
Fück it if we did but I hope we aint lose no fans from it
Im a grownass kid you know aint never cared about no damn money
Why do we try so hard to be stars just to dodge comments
And this that shit thatll make you call your baby mama
When you gone on half a pill dont know why but that I did
Then you take a flight back to the crib yall make love like college kids
And you say all the shit you gon do better we can try this shit again
Round the time the dope wear off you feel stupid she feel lost
Thats that dope I mean I mean dopamine you think Cupid done worn off
Waiting in the hallway with her arms crossed
Her baby boy face full of applesauce
Maybe should have stayed but it aint your fault
Too much pressure I fell off Im sorry
Was young and had to choose between you
And what the rest of the world might offer me shit what would you do
Well Id probably do it differently if second the chance
Only if some cool ass older man wouldve let me know in advance
This this quarry that is dug so deep in a fathers chest
When he feel that hes broken up his nest
And he figured shit he was just doing the best that he could
Which end up being the worst that he could
And all some pussy nigga on the internet can say is that verse aint good
Its boring boring Really Hahaha
When Im disgusted with this world and I can hardly breathe
Told so many lies dont know what to believe
I discussed it with this girl and this is what she said
She said lay down baby baby rest your weary head up
I love these distractions but my mind dont wanna rest
But my body disagree so I laid up on her breasts yes
Oh you are so fücking fine
I woke up the next morning with new purpose on my mind
Oh who pulls your ponytail who knows your body well
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to

No one has swagga like these fo guys
When it comes to styles I got several
Sharper than a swagger dagger all metal
And my jewels blue and yellow
Type of shit that make em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet make you feel special
Ha what the fuck you boys talking about
I know its us cause we the only thing you talk about
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us swagger like us
YeaYou thinkYou go see Weezy for the wordplay
Kanyeezy for diversity and me for controversy
All my verses picture perfect only spit to serve a purpose
You aint living what you kickin and you worthless
Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it
Last thing Im worried bout is what another rapper do
Aint nobody hot as me
Even if they rap they ass off blast off and have outstanding qualities
Sell alotta records I respect and salute that
But spitting real life on hot beats
Im the truth at you kick it like me no exaggeration necessary
Living revolutionary nothing less than legendary
Gangsta shit hereditary got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us swagger like usLyrics submitted by Leandra
Alright okay I dont dance no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it round in the air
Alright okay I dont dance no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it round in the air
New Akoo outfit with a Gucci rag
Tied to my belt loop and my Louis bag
Full of stacks rubberbands round big cash
Got a sick swag til the haters get mad come on
We in the club homes gettin our thug on
Bottles of Patron if you grown get your buzz on
We brought the broads out and brought the cars out
Im like the moon I shine and bring the stars out
When it dark out get the squad out
We ball hard suck a dick eat ya heart out
Im too advanced super swag in my Louis pants
Fallin on my Louis shoes shirt match my Louis rag
Alright okay I dont dance no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it round in the air
Alright okay I dont dance no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it round in the air
I say whoa kimosabe big ballin is my hobby
Im boppin while Im walkin rag fallin out my pocket
If big money aint the topic homie I aint even talkin
Hated on by the workers but Im cool with all the bosses
Catch me flossin at the mall talkin to a broad
She follow me in Gucci and I taught her how to ball
3 pair of shoes 4 shirts 6 rags
Chick said damn thats more than my bag
Shawty I can show you how to spend this bread real fast
Then get a group of chicks to give you head real fast
Silk scarf hangin outta my jeans yall
Homie I aint thinkin Im just doin my thing
Alright okay I dont dance no way

Take my Gucci rag out and wave it round in the air
Alright okay I dont dance no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it round in the air
I took some time off and now Im back yall
You in the line at the club Im in the back dawg
And when this song on ballas peel stacks off
And make it rain on them broads watch the stacks fall
And pull your rag out and wave it left right
Let it sag with ya pants get ya swag just right
Ride Bankhead flare flyin out the Benz
Once a fool with it we gon bring em out again
Alright okay I dont dance no way

Alright okay I dont dance no way

Goodnight its over with thats all she wrote
Its stupid how Im going on everybody knowing that
Im sewing up the game destroying like they hate me for it
Eventually see they cant beat than with me they join
others sworn under oath or banished left completely scorn
you tell lies get caught ngga kick rocks
you never did blend in with the big shots
on the fast track aint no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at ngga wishing it was this hot
guess they mad at me huh really pissed off
better that than pissed on
Im the Jetsons you the Flintstones
catch me in the end zone
high stepping prime time
thought you nggas been on
aint no blocking my shine
like my new air Yeezys you can see me in the night time
I get rich off living life you check to check reciting rhymes
so call me what you want wanna hate have a nice time
while I get stupid paper hey my dough aint in its right mind
Now I dont really care what you call me
just as long as you dont call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight its over with thats all she wrote
streets like cold Chicago
aint nothing new Ive seen it all before
but still I ball like no tomorrow
goodnight its over with thats all she wrote
Your staring straight into a barrel of hate
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah youre late your train left
Mascara and egg smeared on your face
Nights over goodbye hoe
I thought that I told ya the spilled nut aint nothing to cry over
Never shoulda came within Range of my Rover
Shoulda known i was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick whos coming up after I blind fold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with the mind hold up
She mistook me for some high roller
But i wont buy her a soda
Unless its rock n rye cola Faygos cheaper
Buy u a bag of fritos I wouldnt let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldnt die for ya
tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars
you get your eyes swole up im on my straight grizzly
so why would I buy you a gay ass teddy youre already bipolar
Chorus 2 Eminem
Now I dont really care what you call me
you can even call me cold
these bitches know as soon as they saw me
its never me to get the privilege to know em
I roll like a desperado now I never know where Im gonna go
still I ball like theres no tomorrow until its over and thats all she wrote
TI Verse 3
The credit roller curtain closer movie over with
But dont get mad at me
go blame the chick who wrote this shit
ya life is sure a bitch
but she know Im rich
that why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
here I go again
I kick this shit give a damn got it pouring in
Peso Euro yeah ah ha Im paid never gon be broke again
see me posted in anything wearing any chain
never gon see me toting anything
all you gon see is BANG
its so nice where I kick it
hate you never get to visit
yeah Im on another level
but you nggas still can get it
its all over fore you finish
sorry bro this road we end it
wont give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business
Yeah I guess life is a bitcha aint it TIP
and this one can say this shit
shirt off my back I wouldnt give you the dirt off my handkerchief
Im giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
let em get a good taste of it
Im sure you got that relationship memo by now
but in case you didnt
this is so bad better stick your nose to your forehead and staple it
life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
so I pace this shit a little bit quicker
that clock come racing in double time in it
but I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
it may take you pricks to catch on
while you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
man I still say Kmarts like theres an apostropheS on it dog
and they say McDonalds isnt a restaurant well I guess Im wrong
but if you gon tell me that the AW aint the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the F on dawg
and on my throne I remain all alone in my lane
Im as strong as they came
they were gone fore they came
now I dont wanna hang I slap fire with them rap guys
they just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty thats why
Now I dont really care what you call me
you can even call me cold
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight its over with thats all she wrote
I roll like a desperado now I never know where Im gonna go
But still I ball like theres no tomorrow
Good night is over with thats all she wrote
all she wrote all she wrote
I said its over with
thats all she wrote all she wrote all she wrote
Goodnight its over with thats all she wroteLyrics submitted by anais
