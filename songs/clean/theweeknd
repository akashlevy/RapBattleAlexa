Cause they warned me bout your type girl

You got me puttin time in time in
Nobody got me feeling this way
You probably think Im lying lying
Im used to bitches comin right way
You got me touchin on your body
You got me touchin on your body
To say that were in love is dangerous
But girl Im so glad were acquainted
I get you touchin on your body
I get you touchin on your body
I know Id rather be complacent
But girl Im so glad were acquainted
All my niggas think Im crazy cause Im thinkin bout us lately
But really if I could
Id forget about you get about you get about you
You got me puttin time in time in
Nobody got me feeling this way
You probably think Im lying lying
Im used to bitches comin right way

To say that were in love is dangerous
But girl Im so glad were acquainted
I got you touchin on your body

I know Id rather be complacent
But girl Im so glad were acquainted were acquainted
Momma called me cryin cryin cryin cryin

The fast life keeps gaining on me shit
But ever since I met you

Cause Im trying to love you crazy
Put some more inside your cup
And drink till you numb the pain
I got you touchin on your body
These girls keep touchin on their body
They got accustomed to the life we live
These girls born in the 90s are dangerous
I got em thinkin that they want me
Although they know they not the only
I got em wanting to embrace their sins
These girls born in the 90s are dangerous
You loved me for all the wrong reasons
Theres nothing but pain left gere I know
Whats killing me is that Im killing you
Three years of torment and torturous love
Stained with tears and mistrust
I cant hold you any longer in this hell Im in
Cause your heart is to weak for me to break it again
All the mistakes that Ive made
You forgave what the fuck You shouldnt have stayed
Youd always said theres so much love in you
I cant believe that you cant see that
You loved me for all the wrong reasons
Im not the same I used to be
Theres nothing but pain left gere I know
Whats killing me is that Im killing you
Do you remember the beginning Heartbeats one and the same
Burning bright as a flame
So young and in love no care what anyone said
Til my soul grew cold and my heart turn dead
What went so wrong with me
Why did I break this
Why was I so blind and fucking dumb to see
That we were perfect til I turned around and gave in to debauchery
This is your chance to escape this my goodbye with a last kiss
Cause I know deep down you know that
You loved me for all the wrong reasons
Im not the same as I used to be
Theres nothing but pain left gere I know
Whats killing me is that Im killing you
You loved me for all the wrong reasons
Im not the same as I used to be
Theres nothing but pain left gere I know
Whats killing me is that Im killing you
And I know shell be the death of me at least well both be numb
And shell always get the best of me the worst is yet to come
But at least well both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know yeah this I know
She told me Dont worry about it
She told me Dont worry no more
We both knew we cant go without it
She told me youll never be in love oh oh oooh
I cant feel my face when Im with you but I love it but I love it
I cant feel my face when Im with you but I love it but I love it
And I know shell be the death of me at least well both be numb
And shell always get the best of me the worst is yet to come
All the misery was necessary when were deep in love
This I know yes I know and I know
She told me Dont worry about it
She told me Dont worry no more
We both knew we cant go without it
She told me youll never be in love oh oh oooh
I cant feel my face when Im with you but I love it but I love it
I cant feel my face when Im with you but I love it but I love it
She told me Dont worry about it
She told me Dont worry no more
We both knew we cant go without it
She told me youll never be in love oh oh oooh
I cant feel my face when Im with you but I love it but I love it
I cant feel my face when Im with you but I love it but I love it
You’ll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won’t you please let me be
I’ve been here times before
But I was to blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won’t seduce me
Hey baby do what you please
I have the stuff the you want
I am the thing that you need
She looked me deep in the eyes
She’s touchin’ me so to start
She says there’s no turnin’ back
She trapped me in her heart
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician’s fan after the curtains comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that’s so carefree
Hey baby do what you want
I’ll be your night lovin’ thing
I’ll be the freak you can taunt
And I don’t care what you say
I want to go too far
If you make me a star
She said I have to go home
Cause I’m real tired you see
But I hate sleepin’ alone
Why don’t you come with me
I said my baby’s at home
I didn’t call on the phone to
Diana walked up to me
She said I’m all yours tonight
At that I ran to the phone
I said unlock the door
Because I forgot the key
She said he’s not coming back
Because he’s slepping with me
Dirty Diana no Lyrics submitted by shayla struve
It wont be in vain
And learn to love what burn
And gather courage to return
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night
The light will shine through the rain
And heaven will hear them call your name
And home will feel like home again
Corruption will fill your brain
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night
They will parade upon your victory
They will parade upon your victory
Youll put a smile upon their faces
The world will be yours for the taking
The story you birth will be ageless
Just learn to love pain and be patient
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night
You make it look like it’s magic
Cause I see nobody nobody but you you you
Im so use to being used
So I love when you call unexpected
Cause I hate when the moments expected
So Ima care for you you you
Ima care for you you you you yeah
Cause girl youre perfect
Youre always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it
You know our love would be tragic
So you dont pay it dont pay it no mind
We live with no lies
Youre my favorite kind of night
On that lonely night
We said it wouldnt be love
But we felt the rush
It made us believe it was only us
Convinced we were broken inside inside
You make it look like it’s magic
Cause I see nobody nobody but you you you
Im so use to being used
So I love when you call unexpected
Cause I hate when the moments expected
So Ima care for you you you
Ima care for you you you you yeah
The way you work it
Cause girl you earned it
You know our love would be tragic
So you dont pay it dont pay it no mind
We live with no lies
Youre my favorite kind of night
We said it wouldnt be love
But we felt the rush
It made us believe it was only us
Convinced we were broken inside inside
Tell me what youre feeling
You say you dont need to go
Dont you pretend you didnt know
How all of this would end up
Girl I saw it in your eyes
And baby I can read your mind
And expectations were not in sight
You knew that talking dirty to me on the phone would get me here
Cause we both wanted to do this but I could tell that you were scared
Cause you thought there was more to us but you knew how this would end
Its gonna end how you expected girl youre such a masochist and I ask why
And you reply I like the thrill
Nothings gonna make me feel this real
So baby dont go home
I dont wanna spend tonight alone
Would you end your night with me
Dont you leave me all behind
Dont you leave my little life
No no no no no Lyrics submitted by Tina Marie Landry

And its kinda hard to breathe
But youre turning 23 so Ill fuck you if you need
Imma give you what you fiend
But I aint taking off my black boots
Cuz Im numb from the neck down
You wont know that I cant feel it
I can win a fuckin Oscar
By the way I fuckin hid it
And you wont ever fuckin know
Cuz Ill never fuckin show it
Except when I be wheezy from another cup of potion
Said im gone gone gone
You dont know whats in store
But you know what youre here for
Hold tight for this ride
We dont need no protection
Even though you dont roll
You wanna be high for this
Cause I know what youre feeling
Its okay girl I feel it too
Let it be baby breathe

Well be good I promise
Even though you dont roll
You wanna be high for this

All alone she was living
In a world without an end or beginning
Baby girl was living life for the feeling
But I dont mind I dont mind
And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so codependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I dont mind I dont mind
And I know that shes capable of anything its riveting
But when you wake up shes always gone gone gone
In the night she hears him calling
In the night shes dancing to relieve the pain
Shell never walk away I dont think you understand
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
Shell never walk away I dont think you understand
He sang a song when he did it
He was cold and he was so unforgiving
Now she dances to the song on the minute
Yeah all the time all the time
It make her weak when she hear it
And it got her on her knees like religion
She was young and she was forced to be a woman
Yeah all the time all the time
And I know that shes capable of anything its riveting
But when you wake up shes always gone gone gone
In the night she hears him calling
In the night shes dancing to relieve the pain
Shell never walk away I dont think you understand
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
Shell never walk away I dont think you understand
I dont think you understand
In the night she hears him calling
In the night shes dancing to relieve the pain
Shell never walk away I dont think you understand
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
Shell never walk away I dont think you understand
Got you drinking out them white cups sodas
All this shit sounds foreign to you thick smoke choking
Baby get familiar with the order
Just crack it then pour it then sip slow then tip low
My eyes red but my brim low that XO she climbing
Straight to the top forget why she there in the first place
No more crying heart rates low put that rum down you dont wanna die tonight
I promise when you’re finished we’ll head to where I’m living
The party won’t finish it’s a fucking celebration
For my niggas out tonight and they high off Shakespeare lines
Theres enough to pass around you aint gotta wait in line
And the clocks dont work you aint gotta check the time
And the blinds dont work you aint gotta check the sky
We be going all night til light
I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
Theres just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys
Youve been going hard baby now you rolling with some big boys baby
Got a lot you wanna show off baby close that door before you take your fucking clothes off baby
Dont mind all my writings on the wall
Thought I passed my peak and Ill experience some fall
And all I wanna do is leave cause Ive been zoning for a week
And I aint left this little room trying to concentrate to breathe
Cause this piff so potent killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo got me gum chewing
Call one of your best friends
Baby if you mixing up
Cup of that XO baby I been leaning
Back from the come down girl I been fiending
For another round dont you blame it on me
When youre grinding up them teeth and its fucking hard to sleep
I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
Theres just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high

Work that back til I tire out
Roll that weed blow the fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Get so wet when I eat you out
Girlfriend screaming that Im creeping out
If theyre not down better keep em out
Exman hollering keep him out
Hard to let go I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking weed for now
Take a shot of this cognac ease you out
Just one night trying to fucking leave you out

You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all

And we can make you right
And if you get too high

I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around bring your friend with you
But we aint really going to sleep at all
You aint gonna catch me with them sneak pictures
In my city Im a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious
My god white he in my pocket
Get me redder than the devil til I go nauseous
Ask me if I do this every day I said Often
Ask how many times she rode the wave Not so often
Bitches down to do it either way often
Baby I can make that pussy rain often
Often often girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin do it how I want it
Often often girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin do it how I want it
Infatuated by the fame status
She wanna ride inside the GClass Grain matted
I come around she leave that nigga like he aint matter
That girl been drinkin all day need to change bladder
Shes just happy that the crews back in town
Shes bout to go downtown for a whole hour
If I had her you can have her man it dont matter
Im never sour Im just smokin somethin much louder
Ask me if I do this every day I said Often
Ask how many times she rode the wave Not so often
Bitches down to do it either way often
Baby I can make that pussy rain often
Often often girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin do it how I want it
Often often girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin do it how I want it
Oooh the suns risin up
But I see your eyes
Ask me if I do this every day I said Often
Ask how many times she rode the wave Not so often
Bitches down to do it either way often
Baby I can make that pussy rain often
Often often girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin do it how I want it
Often often girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin do it how I want it
I’ll let you show me his moves
Let you do what he taught you
Let you reminisce how you used to do
Girl I’m open to anything that’ll get you into that zone
And understand that we’re all alone
So you can slowly take off your clothes
Baby girl you know what’s in store
Baby I will stay up all night
And I’ve been goin’ hard since last night
And I’mma go harder tonight
Wish you can see you through my eyes
Ooh I’m tellin’ you this ain’t the same
And I know he’s still in your brain
I’m ‘bout to burn that shit into flames
‘Cuz baby when I’m finished with ya you won’t wanna go
And I’mma work you like a pro baby
And you gon’ take it like one
Yeah you gon’ take it like one
And I’mma give it like you asked for it
Why cuz you been talkin’ ’bout it
I know you been talkin’ ’bout it
Ooh baby when I’m done with you why
Yeah you ain’t sayin nothin’
Ooh baby when I’m done with you why
Yeh you ain’t sayin nothin’

All the pain that you feel you can tell that we ain’t makin no love

Got me drowning in the mist
Gimme my attention or Ill start drowning from my wrist
Baby if you knew the feeling I would give to you
Cause I got it girl oh I got it girl
Oh I got it girl oh I got it girl
I got a brand new girl call it Rudolph
Shell probably OD before I show her to mama
All these girls tryna tell me she got no love
And all these girls never ever got her blow job
And if she stops then I might get violent
So mama please stop calling
We could play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fucking prove this feeling Ima give to you

Where were you when I needed you eight months ago
All your girlfriends talkin bout me now you ringin up my phone
Bet you miss me now baby bet youd kiss me now baby
Especially since you know that this aint nothin and I only just begun
You never thought that I would ever go this far
You said potential could never last this long
Well baby Ive been alone for almost all my life
What makes you think that you could ever do me right
Youre the same old song
Youre the same old song
Youre the same old song
Youre the same old song
And now Im poppin yea
Aint nobody showed me how
I made it big poppin yeah
Tell me how you like me now

And you probably went and fucked the world
Well you can take another shot everytime you hear me playin in the club
You never thought that I would ever go this far
never thought Id go this far I made it
You said potential could never last this long
you never thought it could last so long
Well baby Ive been alone for almost all my life

If you try to play your luck
Ain’t nobody gonna care enough

Cause you look even better than the photos

Cant believe I made it but I made it thats for sure
For sure loving I need more I need yours
She aint looking for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on

Baby livin off bliss got me drowning in your love
Got me drowning in the mist
Gimme my attention or Ill start drowning from my wrist
Baby if you knew the feeling I would give to you
Cause I got it girl oh I got it girl
Oh I got it girl oh I got it girl
I got a brand new girl call it Rudolph
Shell probably OD before I show her to mama
All these girls tryna tell me she got no love
And all these girls never ever got her blow job
And if she stops then I might get violent
So mama please stop calling
We could play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fucking prove this feeling Ima give to you
Oh you Oh I got it girl oh I got it girl
Oh I got it girl oh I got it girl
Oh I got it girl Lyrics submitted by milagros
You did many things that I liked that I liked
And you like diamond rings
I can provide I can provide for you
You made me feel so good
Before I left on the road
And you deserve your name on a crown on a throne
I havent been around the town in a long while
Ive been trying to get this money like I got a couple kids who rely on me
I remember on the bathroom floor
Before I went on tour
When you said we couldnt do it again
Cause you had a thing with some other man
You said it was love
And you said you were lost
Then you wished me good luck
To find somebody to love
Now Ive heard that youre single
And oh Ill give you something to live for
You never thought youd ever see my face again
But your love just swayed the lies
When he stared into your eyes
He just might be too good for you
Youre almost dead to him
Youre sleeping with a frozen heart
Well baby girl its over now
And you can always count on me
Your unshackled bind unrestrainted touch
And it feels so priceless to me
That youll take me in
Now Im everything your everything
I bet youll take me in
I know youll take me in now
The same place I left you in
I bet youll take me in
I know youll take me in I know youll take me in
The same place I left you in
You did many things that I liked that I liked
And you like diamond rings
I can provide I can provide for you
You made me feel so good
Before I left on the road
And you deserve your name on a crown on a throne
I tell myself that Ill take you for the last time
Ill be over you eventually
Time after time you seem to push me off
I understand what we have become
You wash your neck when you leave now I know your routine
I was in love with your mystery
Now I just take what I can get from you
Im not embarrassed to be what you want me to be
Cause unlike you I got nothing to hide
I dont pretend to have any shame
I got a box we could put all your lies in
Until the end of days
You know that I will be a call away
The call you make when youre all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done
Well here comes the sun
And youre in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That youll stay through the night
You just wanna fill the void now
I can tell that youve been yelling at him all night long
And I can hear it in your voice now
He got you smoking extra packs a day
Dont you worry bout me talking
I know why youve been coming
Ill be quiet this aint nothing to me
Just wrap your legs around my waist
I wont stop until you ask me
Dont you worry bout us messing up my sheets
Cause unlike you I got nothing to hide
I dont pretend to have any shame
I got a box we could put all your lies in
Until the end of days
You know that I will be a call away
The call you make when youre all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done
Well here comes the sun
And youre in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That youll stay through the night
Girl I know you so well
Girl I know you so well
Girl I know your routine
Yes I know your routine
Girl I know you so well
Girl I know you so well
Girl I know your routine
Well here comes the sun
And youre in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That youll stay through the night
This house is not a home to you
But you decide to go ahead and lay down lay down
There are no words to describe the depth of your indifference
Cause I see your here to stay
Shouldve known to pick my fate Oh no
Im so wrong Im so wrong to let you in my
To let you in my home Now you know where I sleep
Now you know where I sleep
Never felt so damn weak
Did you have to tell your friends about the way I got you screamin my name
Did you have to tell the world
Now your girls all wanna fuck
Girl you coulda been the one
Gotta change my number twice a month
When you coulda simply kept me on the down low
Im so wrong Im so wrong to let you in my
To let you in my home Now you know where I sleep
Now you know where I sleep
Never felt so damn weak
Baby if I knew youd be living in my sheets
I wouldntve shown you any love
I wouldve left you in the club
You say you dont belong
You keep saying theres no one
And theres no where to go
But who keeps calling on your phone
Im so wrong Im so wrong Im so wrong
Im so wrong Im so wrong to let you in my
To let you in my home Now you know where I sleep
Now you know where I sleep
Never felt so damn weak
Im so wrong Im so wrong to let you in my
To let you in my home Now you know where I sleep
Now you know where I sleep
Never felt so damn weak
There comes a time in a mans life
When he must take responsibility
For the choices he has made
There are certain things that he must do
Things that he must say
And nobodys going to know
I never thought Id feel this kind of hesitation tonight
My hand on another girl ooh
I wish I didnt have to lie
I wish I could let you know
And nobodys going to know if its true
I know you can see through me
I know you can see through my lies oh oh
You just choose to never know
No you just dont know what I do what I do
Why pretend to trust in me
I dont know why you try to trust in me baby but I think I might know
Youd rather this than be alone
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I only want you oh
And nobodys going to know if its true
Cause I love you ooh
And I need you yea
I only want you ooh
And nobodys going to know if its true
And I love you cause I love you baby
And I need you and I need you
And nobody gonna know ooh
It was so hard to say the same thing
And youre so weak to say the same thing
Girl dont hold onto your apprehensiveness
And let the wildfire shine
And repeat after me
Good girls go to heaven
And bad girls go everywhere
And tonight I will love you
And tomorrow you wont care
I leave it all to you
Let it come to you
I leave it all to you
Let it come to you
Youre in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Youre too shy away from me
Just sacrifice your every last inhibition
Im on your side
Is the only time well have each other
Why would you try to waste this precious time
Cause tonight Ill be right here
And tomorrow you wont care
I leave it all to you
I leave it all to you
Let it come to you
I leave it all to you
I leave it all to you
Let it come to you
Youre in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Theyre in love with this idea of love
Its a shame that theyll believe it will come
For us all for us all
Youre in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
I leave it all to you
I leave it all to you
Let it come to you
I leave it all to you
I leave it all to you
Let it come to you
I leave it all to you
I leave it all to you
Let it come to you

And Ima love you girl

Blame it on the night life lights passin you yeah

Hipster nights downtown and your daddy dont know youre out

When your hairs a mess
And youre filled with regret
And you feel like you gotta go home
Cause these nights pass so much quicker then the days did
Same clothes you aint ready for your day shift
But you up you need money for ya face lift
Waken up with most of ya side wet
Another room you hear your mom cryin
Cause she found your bag stuffed in the laundry
And the Bacardi from the last party
If they wont let you in
You know where to find me
And if you wanna go again

Cus all we ever do is love
Open up ya mind you can find the love
Dont you worry bout a thing

Oh theres so much love to pass around
Girl the nights almost done
And who you came with is already gone
You said you want me
But I remember who you are
Girl it wasnt long ago

You said you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all

Need for you is to meet my boys

And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby come over here and ride it out
Just ride itLyrics submitted by Ambistaytrue
