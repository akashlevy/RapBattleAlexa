Yeah Im taking niggas lunch money
Too bad I was fing hungry
Real niggas dont notice you
Im the only dopeboy quotable
Mami tryna land a Sinatra
So she dont f niggas with Apple watches
Cause Rolex shopping is more exciting
Shout out to dopeboy LED 16 swipers
Movie on my neck with the screen gems
Me and my nigga havin bottle wars
40 thousand on the floor when them bottles pour
Spill nigga a Blu Ray to your DVD
You mightve caught me on TMZ
Cameo tryna sue a nigga f em
Cuz I party hard like its three of me
Americas still abusing us
And 911 is the Ku Klux
So why wouldnt I fire back
When everyday them niggas shooting us
True enough Im out of line
You better stand for something before you out of time
This is crime by design
If the crown aint mine tell me who am I behind
Yeah Im taking niggas lunch money
Too bad I was fing hungry
Real niggas dont notice you
Im the only dopeboy quotable
Pocket get me everything I want
Riding round with Miguel Cotto in the trunk
What Im cooking in the kitchen niggas
Bobby Brown New Edition niggas
What Im wearing in this blizzard nigga
Mink leather or its lizard nigga
St Laurent Im in all layers
The mannequin to you ballplayers
Shout out my Mac 11 monster
Grew up on Nintendo playing Contra
And though that nigga only 59
100 bodies on his timeline
Whats the price of success
Lost my bitch bought a chef
The 911 cost 211
Watch looking like a jewelers heaven
Hottest 7 Im so alive
Your bank account Swiss nigga so is mine
This is crime by design
If the crown aint mine tell me who am I behind
Yeah Im taking niggas lunch money
Too bad I was fing hungry
Real niggas dont notice you
Im the only dopeboy quotable
You know what happens when GOOD Music and MMG get together right
Millions Millions in the ceiling
Millions Millions in the ceiling
Millions Millions in the ceiling
Millions Millions in the ceiling
Choppers choppers in the closet
Choppers choppers in the closet
Choppers choppers in the closet
Choppers choppers in the closet
This that shit that yall wanted
This shit cook up hard dont it
Yall gotta beg my pardon on it
But this shit sound like God dont it yeaah
Im tired and yall gotta pay your tides
Call my Phantom the Holy Ghost
Church on chrome wheel tires
Pop tags when Im paranoid
Cause a pawn shop was my paradise
I was there pop when that powder came
For that not safe in that shoe box
Blue tops blue tops bad bitch in that blue fox
This big face and Bluray and these black diamonds like boondocks
I restore the feeling of when niggas made a killin
Hiding choppers in the closet half a million in the ceiling
And them bitches with angel faces cryin loud with ill intentions
Just so I can buy them Christians have em stuntin on all their bitches ah
Im haunted by horror stories wannabe home owners
Horrible outcome but the boy got one motive
Cries when he convicted cried on every visit
Im crying sayin his name ride for all my niggas
Used to fiddle my fingers until I found me a fortune
Finger fuckin Ferraris South of France early mornin
Do drugs like Donatello Versace my Acapella
Never see me in Neimans nigga commiting treason
Soft loafer prefered frost organic herb
Stay away from the forbes of our only can tell you more
I got this I got that
I got that I got this
Got a kilo for twenty
My niggas say Im the shit
This that shit yall ask for
Make a nigga mash on the gas floored
2 door 4door roll through the hood like task force
Fast forward Oops they say they wanna see proof
My record sales aint much as theirs and we still ridin same coupes
How we still fuckin same hoes
Why we still buy the same clothes
How we both got the same watch
Im just keepin yall on your toes
That price drop and that coke rise
Then set it over that blue flame
Then hang to dry like clothes line
I restore the feeling of when niggas made a killin
Hiding choppers in the closet half a million in the ceiling
Got the razor on the counter Arm Hammer in the kitchen
Just to keep my feet in Christians and keep dickin all your bitches aaah

Shake that body party that bod
Shake that body party that bod
Shake that body party that body
Come and have a good time with GOD
I believe theres a god above me
Im just the god of everything else
I put holes in everything else
New God Flow fuck everything else
Supreme dope dealer write it in bold letters
They love a niggas spirit like Pac at the Coachella
They said Pusha aint fit with the umbrella
But I was good with the Yay as a wholesaler
I think it’s good that Ye got a blow dealer
A hot temper matched with a cold killer
I came aboard for more than just to rhyme with him
Think ’99 when Puff woulda had Shyne with him
Matching Daytonas rose gold on us
Goin H·A·M in Ibiza done took a toll on us
But since you over do it I’mma pour more
Well if you goin coupe I’m goin four door
Step on they necks til they can’t breathe
Claim they five stars but sell you dreams
They say death multiplies by threes
Line them all up and lets just see
Fuck em Ye fuck em Ye
I wouldnt piss on that nigga with Grand Marnier
Woo They shitty shoppin at Targét
Woo My shit is luxury Balmain Ay
A nick sold in the park then I want in
Whats a king without a crown nigga
Whats a circus without you clown niggas
Whats a brick from an outtatown nigga
When you flood and you can drown niggas
Heres the GOOD Music golden child
MA dollar sign cant nobody hold me down
Hold up I aint trying to stunt man
But these Yeezys jumped over the Jumpman
Went from most hated to the champion god flow
I guess thats a feeling only me and Lebron know
Biggie Smalls Dr Kings Rodney Kings
Cause we cant get along no resolution
Till we drown all these haters rest in peace to Whitney Houston
Cars money girls and the clothes
Aww man you sold your soul
Naww man mad people was frontin
Aww man made something from nothing
Picture working so hard and you cant cut through
That can mess up your whole life like an uncle that touched you
What has the world come to Im from the 312
Where cops dont come through and dreams dont come true
Like there the god go in his Murcielago
From working McDonalds barely paying the car note
He even got enough to get his mama a condo
Then they ran up and shot him right in front of his mom
40 killings in a weekend 40 killings in a week
Man the summer too hot you can feel it in the street
Welcome to Sunday service if you hope to someday serve us
We got green in our eyes just follow my Erick Sermon
Did Moses not part the water with the cane
Did strippers not make an arc when I made it rain
Did Yeezy not get signed by Hov and Dame
And ran to Jacob and made the new Jesus chains
In Jesus name let the choir say
Im on fire ay thats what Richard Pryor say
And well annihilate anybody that violate
Ask any dope boy you know they admire Ye
And all my niggas say GOOD Music
And all my ladies say GOOD Music
I dont know but Ive been told
I dont know but Ive been told
If you get fresh get all the hoes
If you get fresh get all the hoes
Im way fresher than all my foes
Im way fresher than all my foes
Somebody please pick out they clothes
Somebody please pick out they clothes
And all my niggas say GOOD Music
And all my ladies say GOOD Music

It’s the blackout ‘rari got the back out
Showing my black ass engine in the glass house
Started in the crack house Obama went the back route
Kill bin Laden another 4 up in the black house
Still got the Macs out pull the mask down like a mascot
Still trick with bitches out with money or with ass shots
GOOD had room for one more I took the last spot
Reup gang done hit the jackpot
Whole ‘nother level then you add fame
That’s a whole ‘nother devil legit drug dealer
That’s a whole ‘nother bezel the carbon Audemar
That’s a whole ‘nother metal but still keep it ghetto
Behind the scenes pull strings like Gepetto
The gun blow steam whistle like a tea kettle
You and LV Sport shoe on a pedal I let you niggas settle
I got trouble on my mind
So much trouble on my mind
Verse 2 Tyler The Creator
Pharrell said “get ‘em” so I got ‘em
Tripped on Bristol Palin then I accidentally shot ‘em
Then it ricocheted and killed the game
I’m a problem cause I wanna fuck the world but not a fan of using condoms
Pardon my french I’m going hard as my dick
When I envision my tip on the crust of bitch’s lips
Mr Lipschutz has been trippin’ since I mentioned Reptar’s
I feel it in my gut to kill these motherfuckers
As a musk like the arm of my pits
You niggas coming shorter than a Bush Wick Bill costume
On sale during Christmas in Philly
Uhm well not really it’s gettin’ kinda chilly
Let’s hit a couple bars and give some bitches wet willies
Soaked getting’ jiggy with it and BelAir’s britches
With a bag of pills couple berries and a biscuit
Verse 3 Tyler The Creator
I’m a fucking walking paradox
And a really shitty rapper in my favorite pair of socks ironed pair of dockers
Two Glocks cocked screamin’ west side
With the speakers blastin a pair o pacs
Yonkers 10 milli you’re silly
Thinkin’ that this ‘Preme wasn’t free willy
The feeling is neutral the gang is youthful
And fuckin’ tighter than Chad Hugo’s pupils
It’s Wolf Gang and the
With the reup’s a helluva buzz
Rick James said cocaine’s a helluva drug
Who else could put the hipsters with felons and thugs
And paint a perfect picture of what sellin’ it does
This is for the critics who doubted the chemistry
Two different words same symmetry
And this black art see the wizardry
When you at the top of your game you make enemies
