Hasty decisions we may still prevail
Both needed breaks we both needed to bail
Walking thru the corridors of my mind
The hideaways the nooks there filled with good times
Memories certainly yes they still bind
Still a common man and yeah thats for sure
Still a bankroll and yeah still can tour
The madness the thing we had was much more
Come back home dont be out in the world
Its a bad race and always for a girl
And most scavengers have found the pretty pearl
Its for the faint of heart who never get enough
Gotta get tough buckle em up we call em duds
And we and we and we ahhh
Today is nice come on we gettin up
Tonite is right come on we gettin up
Come over here baby dont look so grumpy
This kind of lifestyle could be so comfy
We can start a clan just like the Kennedys
You and I advance certainly we can expand
Feelings that should never end
And you respect me like a friend
But love me like your man
Or we could be like Doves exposed 2 history
Like staying with each other with truth and chivalry
The things we go thru they shape our identity
Yes pretty lets do this all nite
Consummate this thing and make it alright
And when we cuddle up and promise that its right
Today is nice come on we gettin up
Tonite is right come on we gettin up
I like to watch everybody gravitate towards you
Your magnetic presences make them come thru
The same way you got them you got me too
Now look at our lives so colorful
A wonderful spectrum not 1 tone dull
Full of excitement and not 1 luve
See we had an understanding oh yes we did
Im bringing it back Im puttin in my bid
Have a couple of kids have a couple of cribs
We like Louie D and Ossie like martin and corretta
Doin it to death no one can do it better
When we leave our physical our sprits still together
Come on now heres a placement for your hand
You rockin with the 1 MC man
The 1 controller of right with the plan
Today is nice come on we gettin up
Tonite is right come on we gettin up
Said we gettin upLyrics submitted by Destini
Lifes filled with graaaay
But now it comes clean
