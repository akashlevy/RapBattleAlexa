I find a certain comfort in searchin through the
Darkness on my quest to find the light
And as Im digging through the ruins that line these city streets
A sense of hope walks with me
Still I hold onto this dream of and I spite this mind
No longer shall I try to find a name with nor provide
Demons theres so many I smell brimstone
Come in through family Im seein all of the sin shown
Kin grown into enemies thatll be your friends gone
Aint you very lonely but a sanctuary when grims home
Got rules but I dig it God knows that Im wicked
Or does it cause when I tug it it never shows that I visit
Tell the judge yall make me feel like its hella love
So stand out amazed when I let loose on my
My spirit needs jumper cables never know love but I want ya label
Nothing lately makes me feel like they worthy of trustin
So I load my gun with the intentions of bustin
Im cool with the trauma now
Cause its abundant ever since I laid my mama down
Some members talked me so bad til my persona found
No mercy go Earthly cock and make the llama sound
Cause thats the language they know deepened anguish they grow
To people without rules and make you doubt whos
Gonna love you forever cause they gave you some hateful mouth ooze
I was so effin true but I became the person to shout to
Now that Im lonely I dont get no fun like Laos food
And Im such a meanie wanna come and see me Reroute dudes
Im chillin in hell in hot water sittin on my couch fools
So it aint no problem walkin through yo hell in ya house shoes
Im good where I am in the dark and darkness alone
Bring it if you got it to bring
Aint no way you bout to stop this sickness from the
Deepest darkest part of misery psycho alpha schizo
Get your chick she digging me
See me clownin look at all you player haters
Raw God said killem all Techs backs to the wall
Fighting 4 my life and Imma bust back till they fall
And I aint even slangin them thangs Im hollin 187
If you trippin with strange
Im really real with it
like my homey AJ say deal with it
Pushin and pullin fightin 4 the mill ticket
in a minute imma do it like a villain
Imma getem in the middle of a Bomb
putem on the spot till the funk go pop and
I bet he never have another quam
Tech nizzle when Im thizzled its who B you
Dave Trav Violet Brown and 3DQ
for those who not knowing that Mizzou thee true
Imma tell ya like the swedish would say it
Thats the only way to roll
They love us everywhere we go
Tecca ninas bout to blow
I do hip hop and I mix it with the hard rock
Designing this rhyming 4 climbing
greedy so we constantly grinding
I been in the game 16 years making rap tunes
raising hella havoc up in the classroom
now in 02 you can watch me
clownin diamonds shining watchin dvds on
Its all Jesus now I keep the crowds pumpin they
Jumpin get back to the tele we rollin and stickin
Somethin racing to the main line absolute power
Is having Halle Berry and Juliet Lewis at the same
Oh thats how strange niggas run listen to the villain
With the gun associated tongue were close to the
the Techs just began begun
beginning to begin to have fun
The curse is tryin to put me in the hearst

Enemies they runnin now all my haters bummin

Ready to noose me cause they know that

I see you looking at me
Looking at me so I ask
Am I a psycho Am I a psycho
Yeah I’m a psycho I guess I’m a psycho
You’re crazy I like you but you’re crazy my tours paid me
So I used that dough to allure ladies to manure bathe me
Never that my minds for sure shady
Pure Hades Rev X Steady couldn’t endure to save me
Why did I let this stripper burn me on the arm with a cigarette
In the same spot 10 times in a row when i feel that burn I palm the clitoris
I’ma get her wet sorry to get carried away I feel stupid cause I ain’t did her yet
Maybe she never let a fine nigga stare at her breasts and get vexed so N9NE bit her neck
Open I try to contain it but that damn dame thang’s soakin’
Alter ego say why you let them gang bang folk in
Strange Lane hopin’ I can maintain coping
But ain’t nobody talkin when the insane mane spoken
I like fire on my skin blood on my draws
From up on her walls I’m suffering I’m stuck in her claws
Stuffed in her jaws huffin’ and puffin’ hollerin im a dog afterwards i like really hot scalding water on my balls
Mom Dad I’m no longer the boy you’ve used to seeing
I’ve changed a lot plus I’ve grown to hate every human being
My mood swings have now turned my dreams into gruesome scenes
Now I’m doing things I don’t normally do
When illusions seem to be the only pleasures I can gain
Heck if I was sane I’d put down the mic and say fuck it I’ll never rise to fame
But with the wicked records I contain I could probably jeopardize your name
No loveydovey let’s ignite the flame if you’re lucky you survive the pain
Sorry that ain’t very merry to say why is this game so scary to play
Well let me think cause every day my balls are getting too hairy to shave
Pause a minute I’m stressin’ the game if I go to hell than heaven’s to blame
I don’t mean to come off crazy but you mothafuckas seem to think that I’m hella deranged
When I was seven years old I fell on my head and I severed my brain
If you think I’m lying then ask my mama nigga she’ll go tell you the same
Should I be ashamed No I’m living my life so ghetto fabulous
Before you get bent outta shape my nigga let me ask you this
I stab you with this mic and rap this verse I’m rappin’ to you
Matter fact I’m rapping through you never say my motherfucking name
Unless you absolutely have to I am not no fucking jacket
With no matching shoes and you are not no fashion guru
Can’t even see you niggas y’all wish I was rappin’ to you
Matter of fact act like I’m rappin’ to you if that gives you passion
To use as an excuse to jump out of conclusion
That I’m attackin you dudes is just like old fashion voodoo
Y’all ain’t even the shit no ya’ll ain’t even the doodoo
I got more flavor on the tissue paper under my two boots
So I’m slapping you fools with wooden paddles you stupid
Baby sitting little bastards like little afternoon children
You can call me psychotic but it’s more like schizophrenic
And I can speak can anyone tell me just where my medicine is
Guess I gotta show these minors just what my avenue is
Man I swear I’m all about my brain like graduate students
I’m sorry I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings
I see your tears come here give me your face let me clear it
But I wonder how it would look if I could peel it back with a skillet
Then I would feel it crack when I hit it then I’mma split it back when you heal it
Dammit Bobby boy what in the hell what in the heaven what in the Earth
Where is your mom Why do you curse Where are you from
Where was your birth Where was you first Why weren’t you in church
Why is there dirt all on your shirt Man I think you’re going berserk

The same situations that occur throughout your life
that gives you an attitude you know a really bad attitude
because youve been taught by good people how to treat people with respect and you learned right wrong
so when shit is always wrong around you and you a mothafucka just taught to do right
you have a certain attitude towards those kind of mothafuckers or towards those things that are wrong and not righteous
you start getting a fuckin attitude that might piss other people off
but you dont give a fuck
because the things they do are the unjust shit that they do
makes you anti as fuck
anti everything anti everything they are bout
cause they aint good anti everything they fuckin breathe or eat or whatever the fuck
youre just against everything that aint right

Depreciating for justice keep waiting cause you burned up everything except the police station

You hate me cause tough and freelys the tone
I aint never shopped on Black Friday nigga leave me alone
COINTELPRO we livin it out
Used to love turkey devour Thanksgiving about
Jack your land from the Indians and murk em on it
Make it bigger then get the niggers to come and walk upon it
Give em drugs and guns and excuses to never be
Better than a CRIP or rep the letter B
Show you you can YouTube it and make fights
Vatican at it again bangin for they gay rights
And Im supposed to follow YOU to the Promiseland
I aint got no insurance leave it in Obamas hand
At 19 I slapped the shit out a cop
Now Ferguson had me murderin burn down a donut shop
You dumb niggas Ooh youll be the only bum niggas
Get your ass out the street fore I shoot me more than one niggas

Question for the the maker…and its…aw yeah
This the way its supposed to be huh Alright
On a glass of red wine
This is Nina tellin you to listen
The vision Im givin everyday
Life is dumpin on us like a pigeon
I get many enemies with this Forbes list
But I get rid of energy from piss poor pricks
Can I get to heaven all I get is threatened
Every time I get more chips
For the sick forces I gotta fight
All of the night with cops Crips
And them Nazi’s wanna hem Hadji
Up it ain’t too many men godly
Hideous so many cities bust in
Human equality never been a level playin field
So many circles of sin rob me
That’s why we go angel to grim Cosby’s
Yellin this to my superior
Degrading of love is inferior
Upon this earth a lot of people jerked around about 300000 to Syria
I could never think of burying my children ppperiod
Nigeria Imma yell while Im walking through this hell cause Im furious
Zuse know whats up he said you got to pack a toy
But why you gotta let the bodies dropping at a coffee shop in Aussie Aussie Oi Oi Oi
But around here loving cocos the bomb
Meanwhile so many people are taken out by the hands of Boko Haram
They gotta suffer the penalty cause of our education
Nobody wanna say nothing but I gotta call it abomination
Pissed off thinkin what this cost
What these babies blood drippin for
So I say in Latin listen Lord
Only way people are gonna be able to kill off a demon is
Pick up a gun and be ready to put it between him
No fear the only way
Every day flatten the beast
At least Anonymous is hacking for peace
And yet we gotta bust cause we packing a piece
Choke not another one of us for the snappin police
Who the hell a brother gonna trust when its always dishonor
And I aint even got around to askin you the question God

A vendetta in hopes of unity

Knuckle up knuckle head niggas been with this knuckle game
Still fuck with Scoob Kutt n Kalli baby aint nothin changed

I dont make funny with niggas I dont get honey with niggas
Just keep it one hunned with niggas
Tripping one thousand with niggas
I rentin houses with niggas
I put in work with the squad we even so foul with a nigga
Bass ackwards anonymous with rappers
All these niggas claiming they maintaining with the factors
When you push a package would you ever clap shit
All these niggas talking aint done nothing but this rap shit
Reason why I take this place and had to find some spaces
I killed one of these fucking rap niggas and ate his fucking face
Glaze at this rap game mistake I ever made
It hit me wind and rewind deleting everything I layed
More frim a rap nigga rock nigga I dont lie for fun
Fuck fame and fuck you and fuck him and her too
Had to call the big dog I had to breathe smoke
But Yo Gotti and Big Scoob and this aint called dope
She let me hit that ass backwards
Pussy niggas act hard get killed for bad acting
Its funny how this shit go
Redrum was the case that they gave me
I sipped slow and stumbled down a slipped slope
I could hide the chopper in the trench coat
Tunechi go berserk in this bitch
Spellin stressed backwards dessert when my shit
My double R R I park on the curb in this bitch
The money Im submerged in this shit
So frankly Im stalking Ben Franklin
I am Wayne Carter oops I meant Cayne Warter
Bitch you are bass ackwards if you think thats awkward
Im just a young boy trying to get my money on
Making music in KC hehehehehe
But Mitch Bade niggas wanna hate Techa Nina
And they wont stop fucking with me so I’ma fuck wit niggas
Nanananana you can not fuck with
That nigga Tech N9ne coming wit that rough shit
Them niggas know that I deserve it when they heard it
Had the nerve to say its nothing nigga so I got to bust this
Be Jealous This is dedicated to all yall haters
Be Jealous I see yall watching me when I walk in the club
Be Jealous This is dedicated to all Mitch Bader’s
Be Jealous You mother fuckers aint showing Tech Nina no love
And the pain come nigga with a bang I’ma killer better duck MuhFucker
Watch you standing on Nada What you claim to bone Nada
What you plan to own Nada That shit done came and gone
Blood sweat and tears nigga been about fifteen years nigga
Aint never been no fears nigga All I hear is cheers nigga
That’s why I be in the bathroom with the bitches at Maniacs
That’s why them hoes in the club with Tech given blowjobs in the back
How many niggas really worry bout scars How many niggas wanna become a wuss
Fuck with a nigga like Tech and a buzz Right to the head and the grave is dug
Mean Mugs niggas aint never seen love
So they stream blood while I fiend bub full of green shrubs
And mushrooms I bust rooms open a custom
To float across the ocean with verbal motion the notion is boasting
Im hoaking with jealous mother fuckers embellish
But you can’t say I aint ready for fame yonks and relish
Be Jealous when you see me on the TV Screen whiling
Be Jealous when you see me in the magazine smiling
Be Jealous when they let me in the club for free niggas
Be Jealous cuz Im bumy wit bitches around me
Haha mother fucker haha haha
Haha mother fucker haha hehehehe
Haha mother fucker haha haha
And the lit I’ma spit I’ma kick that shit
No more stalling I’ma start prowling on niggas growling on niggas
And we smiling cuz the Villain album went six thousand on niggas
In Kansas City alone we packed the dome with Mike and Liddy alone
In the west side Lee Jone Milly Mal I left you but it’s a pity you’re gone
Niggas ain’t know mine cuz they know it and I’ma do it big
That’s why the Techa Nina never ever got a problem getting a gig
Cuz I rip shit they liked chea I flip shit you make right chea
When I spit shit I get rich quick and make hits from doctors they liked chea
9 millimeter guns gonna be the one making a million when I come
Never gonna be the bum where I come from niggas better get some
Tried to be right to these niggas tried to be nice to these niggas
So now its time for Nine Godzilla to make mice of these niggas
You envy me cuz your bitch play Techa Nina all day
And you see me on MTV kicking it with king Tech my nigga sway
Broke niggas ain’t friends to me you niggas really want me to disperse
Alright I’ll leave but when I come back it’s gonna be 20 G’s a verse nigga
Be Jealous when you see me on the TV Screen whiling
Be Jealous when you see me in the magazine smiling
Be Jealous when they let me in the club for free niggas
Be Jealous cuz Im bumy wit bitches around me
Haha mother fucker haha haha
Haha mother fucker haha hehehehe
Haha mother fucker haha haha
And the lit I’ma spit I’ma kick that shit
Niggas better stop talking about me I ain’t did shit
I don’t rap against niggas stop trying to get me to rap so ya’ll can make grits
Agony don’t be speaking my name I know I fucked up
On a personal tip but if you niggas talking about you better rap mother fuckers better duck
And if any of you niggas over there on the inside infiltrating me and my rouges
Them niggas don’t give no fucks about how many Tech N9ne units sold
And whoever you bitch niggas is saying I’m kicking it in Lee Joes log
Lee Joe’ll tell you I’m original and by the way Lee Joe my dog
And that justice mother fuckers won’t quit saying The Calm Before The Storm” aint shit
We killed yall when 9697 when about when the new shit hit
And I heard niggas said I was washed up said the Tech N9ne flow was sleep
That’s probably why I got new shit in new movies like Digging In Water and Its Too Deep
Niggas be jealous tie you up and beat you down to a bloody pulp son
Got my villains and me mad enough to bust one
I’m the second coming but you don’t know cuz you dumb
Before I go I’ll tell you jealous mother fuckers to suck one
Be Jealous when you see me on the TV Screen whiling
Be Jealous when you see me in the magazine smiling
Be Jealous when they let me in the club for free niggas
Be Jealous cuz Im bumy wit bitches around me
Haha mother fucker haha haha
Haha mother fucker haha hehehehe
Haha mother fucker haha haha

Insanity at its finest Fire starter riot maker
moon stricken animal need bad seed untaimable beast
”Everybody around me always think they know whats
going on inside my mind they think Im Mr Nice Guy all the time
How they say on Diary You think you know but you have no idea”
Must make mo more dough
We will be shaking your floor
Yo cause I’m a Beast
I can smell your womans rosy punani
on the dance floor all the way in VIP
Im a rapper I can snatch her
and she will leave with me because of my stature
Now everybody move everybody bounce
Whoever the Nina choose we about to pounce
With the 151 and a bottle of calm
helpfully let me hit this model in the grado
I like all woman tall woman and small woman
Ya gotta let tech knees tease your shakra
Species release freaks please the monster
Petite beast feast these G’s will rock ya
Handcuff a busta don’t trust a
Round these hustlers homie don’t be a sucker
When your lover say tecca Ninas a brother
shes trying to say that I rushed her then crushed her
Im about to get that money like a robbery
Now I got it all my enemies wanna clobber me
Squallery harder we need dollars comradely
the hotter the scholar be the larger the lottery
Need ten twins gotta succeed spend Gs Ben Franks
We cram G’s in bank breathe said we win thanks
Hungry like the wolf indeed but I give
money to my crooks in need I live
In Sherman Oaks but from Kansas City
I miss home Cali is Business but man its pretty
I aint lying yall Monster for money for mine yall
if I wasnt getting money Id do time dog
Youd never see the nine fall
maid cleaning the bitches with pinesol
Friend this industry is no kin to me
behold the flow of the century
But they scared of me
rappers they dont compare to me
Fair to be said that he dares to be sincerely a rarity
Check the sound scan look around man
Wake up look at you Jacob you in killer clown land
Face paint and jugalettes with bubble butts
And we rock it twisted diddy women in the button ups
Hands down we rock harder than kiss
but rap me Kutt and Krizz
Can I get two stomps and a clap in this bitch
Nina shot to the top cause the plots to get rich
Yet the best for Tech this aint
This is the beast baby
Money and I will destroy you I am the beast

Everyone are you ready for doom cuz Ive blacked the sun and Ive bloodied the moon I bring gloom when I step in the room With the fumes of a tomb flowers bloom when Im taken away

Everyone are you ready for doom cuz Ive blacked the sun and Ive bloodied the moon I bring gloom when I step in the room With the fumes of a tomb I consume all the light in the day
Everyone are you ready for doom cuz Ive blacked the sun and Ive bloodied the moon I bring gloom when I step in the room With the fumes of a tomb flowers bloom when Im taken away
Heat swells teet tells everybody eat nails sleep well Held the gun I come to attack everyone You little crumbs all are done Imma blacken the sun

Deep in the pit of yo brain let it rain
Nigga lookin for a spot to bust

Mother fucker let the glock erupt Box him up

Spray guns might result in you bustin some
Never let a hatin muh fucker
Bleed the chest no need regret
A fun day caper a Sunday paper
So I can read the rest
I can dig it you can dig it
Put a nigga in the grave
if he hate or penetrate
the loop of love a nigga made
if you step into me
Nigga if I start it Imma finish it
Run up on a mother fucka while he fuckin a chick
Put a bullet in her head while she suckin the dick
Wasnt a bit of evidence baby its irrelevant
You got it with yo nigga thats the luck of the grit
Bring pain 2 everyone in your face with the bane
You bury some Its a mother fuckin shame we carry guns
If you dont you insane or very dumb
Teccaninas too rough too rough too hard too hard
too tough too tough you scarred you scarred
Cause a nigga know a mother fuckin round will spit
Fuckin around with the killa clown and shit
If you really wanna do it nigga we can step into it
Put us up against some mother fuckers
and we runnin thru it
Fuck a nigga buck a nigga

Meant I when I said it you remember that
You dont wanna get in trouble

We dont ever stop and take a minute we
Hey son what the fuck are you duckin from
They come bets to fight every fuckin one

Get sprayed by the Tech 9 handgun
Now Im on the out run
Flowin the beginning hot cooked will done
Fuckin wit a crazy insane warlord
Punks wanna trip but they know
Im too mother fuckin hard
Deadly ticking like a time bomb
Fuckin with me you were think you were in Vietnam
When I explode aint nuttin left
but remains for those who are froze
For fuckin wit a nigga insane
Mentally minded mad mother fuckin mad man
Sinkin punks like quick sand
Any punk that bucks up bring a body bag
If you wanna get fucked up
There it is you little bitch made nigga
start runnin when Im playin with the trigga
of an uzi a twelve gauge it really dont matter
Many suckas die when the shot gun scatter
From block 2 block hood 2 hood street 2 street
Boy you cant fuck with me
So for those who chose to jump up and talk shit
Admit ya bitch your little ass got lit
I dont wanna be the one
to get a milla meter in the gut

Cut up in the middle Im a little sick
And different And I meant it

Burn it down Down down down down
Down down down down down
Burn it down Down down down down
Down down down down down
You build me up you build me up
To watch me fall Its under dust
Is this the place I used to love
Cant take no more Ive had enough
So burn it down down down down
Burn it down down down down
They lift you up and preach you
Then try to pull you down and beat you
Never knew a buddy would become seethrough
Make it up so high they cant reach you
They just feel the wind beneath you
Camaraderies a plum oddity with some modesty
People apology who lovin me never a dollar tree wanted
But they wanna demolish me question mark
When they know Im blessed at heart
Try to test Tech when I poke at they chest and bark
Givin my blood sweat tears and flesh in art
But they come in my circle and make a mess then dart
I feel like they wishin for me to be dissin so they can be quick and then witness me falling down
Gotta know thatll never happen forever rappin
So burning it down is the mission
Dismissin got a brand new condition Im falling down
Kill em in a really clever fashion
Why would a good businessman sign a artist
And he really believes he rhymes the hardest
And spend a lot of money and time just to start it
And you think he dont want you to make it sounds ret
Uh Trav aint the target I aint the puppet
If you got negativity boy you better tuck it
Givin everything and they trippin I had enough
It took me a while for this menace and now fuck it
Give em a record deal plus the CDs
Take em all on tour to give em the ups
Put em on my record I do my verse and then I send it to them so I can give em the ups
In the long run they aint givin a fuck
Said I aint takin care of my day ones
If I wasnt they wouldnt wait to spray guns
Makin the people think Im wrong is way dumb nigga
Now Im tired hearing my empires falling down
But its really the opposite and Ive got a clear
So many more Os fake family fake friends and foes falling down
But Tech N9nas outta hear
Its the reason me and Trav never had to say Were sorry in this business
Cause we believe if you stay righteous youll receive all your blessings
Ya its like the ultimate party favor baby ya know
two cups to get her hot and out of her clothes ya know
Pineapple juice and Malibu caribou get them all numb
Out of her shell and raise hell
Dont stop till the cops come
Half a bottle of 151
Off of the jug one cup of and Malibu rum
Then you fill the rest of the jug
With pineapple juice and its cracking
The only defect is waking up like what happened
I like red light parties and fed right bodies
Who like bread like dolly and head right totties at night
You pay the liquor store teller with no hairor tupay
I like them thick and juicy
You might be karate punching
Or at the back of the club
Koolaid get you hella 151
We gon drink it until we dumb Diddy dum
Here Kansas city come so give me some
Pineapple juice and and Malibu caribou get them all numb
Make baby girl come outta her shell and raise hell

We living it up in to double it up on sizzles
Why Im the one to drink it
And all the ladies that were doing time
Want you to become a member of my drinking club
You will find Tech N9ne
Trying to tell her truly get nudey
Yes I even do el words
Like to drink it and yell slurs at the movie
If Im heated Im off to get a caribou lou to cool me

And then I say we drink cariboubizzle like I ladie
Originated in Kansas city Missouri
Pineapple juice and Malibu caribou get them all numb

N9na this Water Whats up fam
Damn uh sorry to hear about your moms man
Techalicious this is Wendy Dae
I just heard about your mom
Im so so so so so sorry
Hey this your brother Chris man
Sorry to hear about you moms man
Hey this is Cook right here
I heard about what happened
Lemme know if you need me to do anything
And gimme a call lemme know something okay
Ill be waiting to hear from you
If there is a final hour
Lets hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo what about you x2
Grandma told me the good book said
in the last days get ready for the ten plagues
1st the rivers will be ran with red
2 3 and 4 dead frogs will cause lice and flies
sick livestock is 5 the living they must fight for their lives
6 7 and 8 a boil storms a fire and locusts
9 is darkness so dark its hard for you to focus
and 10 is death of the firstborn
If I said it was questionable the religions would make it a point
to get at me and battle me maybe have this verse torn
How will this curse form
Well creation is a bendarwinism
been at it forever bout at it I got nothin but hurt for em
Cuz really nobody knows when you live then you die where your body goes
if its Hell or its Heaven
6 or the 7 well Ill keep the nina for our be foes in a gamble
thats what life is and its hard to handle
when the bible says worship this by the scriptures written by man though
So when man destroys us the word might not stand so
till that day Im just gon protect my fam with ammo
Ive been looking for something supernatural for a long time now
but I never got proof that a spiritual realm existed wanted to find how
everybody sure of a supreme being are people just seeing things
wondering if we get wings seems sick to believe in an extreme king
I know it sounds far fetched every night i put knees on the carpet
then I pray to whos up with the star set
cuz the earth in its self is a target
cuz there aint too many you can trust in
think of all the women losing their husbands
in Iraq a lot of killing and suffering
what i hope for seems folklore
when the enemy kills and gloat more
cuz they killin us off in this hoax war
then I wake up yellin and my throats sore
cuz the fights there its a nightmare
if it come to me Im in my snipe wear
if a bullet give my lung a slight tear
I wanna believe that the lights there
so all you christians dont get mad at me
i just hope that your mystical magical miracles workin catastrophies
and this aint blasphemy but artillery is my strategy
I hope for a higher power when i look at all these tragedies
oh what a miracle angels and demons
but the only miracle is that people keep believing
right hand on the bible left hand on my rifle
keep that for my rivals and evil deciples
expand your mission man to women
when they attack do you plan to give in
or do you do like i do and say praise the lord and pass the ammunition
cuz we got evil to sweep and wipe up
devils and demons and humans irrelavent
if they looking deceiving i bust
I hope that the higher power is watching over me
cuz we young people dont see faith like most the older see
if he or she is listening
a mere sign can spark me
but if the laws in the bible are bogus
worst case scenario is there never ever was a higher power
so in the midst of chaos now
the only real savior is fire power
In a sun lit world
Of what he believes to be reality
There is unseen by most
An underworld that is just as real
But not as brightly lit a
I can write a verse and take the sun away DARKNESS
Say good bye to light bcause its gone today DARKNESS
Aint no smiling happiness is done away DARKNESS
Watch me paint a pic thatll make you run away DARKNESS
I dont really give of fuck what you think of me I had it up to here yep
Follow me into another demention of insanitys right here step
I know your feelin it Im lovein you when Im kissin n fuckin you n in a minute Im a veer
An by the pluck of the jugular see the blood of my lover and then I finish when your near
Im sorry but I mean it cause when I got the tool on bitch I got bulimic up in her like a
And when they bled on me I was giddy and never squeamish
Bad as a demon I cannot get rid of her I really rely on the feelin of the sex an the red of a
Can I take a bite of your cerebellum I think itll really get me up if I could be suckin your
Id rather just die than inflict any pain on somebody who truly put trusted me
Better yet I just make her the suffer who taught me mocked me n fucked with me
Maybe get up in the club and shoot it up and makem panic at the disco backwards
I can paint a dark picture
You dont want me to start with cha
Dont want me commin with the heart hit cha
Chew you up and if you really tart spit cha
After the brain I put the lemon moraine in
Blood of a dame is what I drain my fangs in
Takein the spirit and the body it came in
Away from the sun n forever you can remain in
When Im all up on a pallet a pain with blood of my name in vain sun up in it
Imna break it down the walls n try to stop me from poppin my gun up in it
Skits onta me honor me for the time never given to the rhyme in another mind lookin like a
Behind the face be the beast of another mutha fucka that be heard the least
So many here me when I say they can that I remember everybody that layd me astray yo fuckem
Nobody but my closest know about my darkness and when they fall away yo fuckm
Im to sick that I never checked outa my mentalward working in sweden
Burin the bodies this song made my memory feedm ghost made me loud and Im proud I can see them
I dont even wanna talk about it but I do it for the demons and the devils alive
Hopein that the nonbelievers get a number two in the eye please try to die save me the time
When I make a move when Im commin through Im a stay devoted to rhyme x9
Devoted to mine hex sign ruda wicked Im a be forever dedine
Picture this my wrist silt pissed off Im hangin from a meat hook
Yo Im bangin on a meat hook its the twist this chapter ya miss the darker the venom of a
Im tellin everybody Im not doin so well Im feelin my noggin to you better watch ya self
Subnoise when Im bangin on a tech set best believe the dark times are here my lips eclipse
If it blood thirst will you run from it
No need cause Im inside of you
When the sun is spit
You cannot escape me Im your last resort your
When you have a evil you cannot report

If ever you need an alibi rely on me I am

And where ganna be great together x6
Where ganna be beautiful together x3
And let me show you what I can do x3

Now shes callin your crib at nights so sick
Wanna pop up and try ta fight your chick
Lorena Bobbitt Told her to slice yo dick
If you Ever break up with a Psycho bitch
Dont give me that shit
But a nigga dont care never could it be fair
Then I was up in a middle lover
Came a double dare when
I was in a Mutha fuckin nightmare
How you ganna fuck me on Sunday
Then you wanna say you love me on Monday
Thinking everybody gotta bow down because your off in your lovin
If your on your telephone
And then she lose it when you use it
If sleep dont leave it on nigga for true she will go though with it
She call a bitch back from your phone and chew the chick a new uterus
Even if that situation not lewd the bitch is ludicrous
Bad when you gotta better bitch around
Sad cause you never wanna kiss her now
Never would got up in the women
If I knew about menace
And now never wanna take her down
If she take her seroquel and selects
The bitch would probably stop and then try to catch yea
Slipin with a beauty itchin to get chya
You betta hope you neva leavin the stretcha
If you with a psycho
Dont go thought with it
Right in the midst of happiness
Her mood will switch and ruin it
You thinking you know women and your just so intuitive

At the end of this
You will have to shoot a bitch
Pleeeease dont bring that Psycho shit to Meeeeee
I love you now dont you love me

Psycho Bitches Psycho Bitches x2
And I want you in my life forever
She poppin up at the club
Lookin for you with the rollers and
When push comes to shove
Here you go on the flo with this hoe again
Psycho bitches never let it go
Trippins enviable be ready to get up and go WHY
Because Tecca Ninna just ended the show
Lookin for white bitch hair on my balls
When you out with the family
She get it poppin right there in the mall
Fuck with a bitch is definite
Better watch who you stepping with
Better watch who the fuck you messin with
Just because I Fucked you that dont mean we getting married hoe
The way you sit around the corner from my house is scary though
Psycho bitch is when it comes to relationships are very slow
Bet chyall never understand its over till your buried Low
Dont me up on the myspace flippin out
Trippin with strippers you think Im digging out
Me sayin that Ill never be taken by the hands of another man

Verse 3 Tech N9ne Liquid Assassin
Stop callin me never really wanna heart felt shit
You aint healthy for me and bitch Im on a health kick
Psycho bitches are selfdestructive weak and helpless

Shes so sick with it I stick hit it and dick fit it
Never did I think for a minute to quit quit it
Chickens on the livin and trippin to get hit it
Turn around flip and then get you into deep shitted
Pussy was imbedded and get it your indebted
You could make a penny or money the man said it
You can run a bitch by adjusting the antennas
But if she demand it your betta forget it
You might go and wake up to knives and rifles
When your eyes closed shes liable
Like I know to move on you like Tae Bo
Even I know this sly hoe like rivals
Been turn you into fiveOh
Either that and your turn your back
And the bitch attack with a blade up in your spinal
Should have listen to phone call just stop with them harassing threats

Listenen hard when I give my heart is it Delusional
When Im thinkin ima boss in the biz but Im lost and I fake it that Im off
In the lid but they pay the cost when it is dark at the crib
Some say that if tell them to hate my people are at the gate ready for
Sealin your fate that is up for debate cause when I make my music aint no
Evil from mister yates callin me
A cult leader I dont really know but ima fosho heater wickedness commin
From mine rove they could blow me but the folks wanna soul see us at the
Bottom with the devil look around and it be no N9na they say I lead em to
Evil like I was jimmy jones and feedin the people when I bleed in the
Steeple the reason they seizin me aint no decreasin my ego my powers for
Good I think would I shrink if somebody took away how good I ink but that
Would never happen Im makin it with the rappin but they want me to collapse
And when I could I sink
I hope I find what Im looking for maybe I should drink just a little more
Im fightin but Im losin feel like the author of confusion Hear me
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life and confusion seems to be my
Alibi Delusional Im feelin like I dont belong feel like Im tellin you to
She feel like Im gonna make them hate because I was around and kick it and
Make them babys and now that I made it gotta escape them daily and thats
Crazy cause all Im doin is makin the industry pay me but when I show my
Face feelin everythings great did a show then we ate then Im outa that
State she said Im a good provider but daddy of the year man Im outa that
Race how I compensate for the losses they get often dates thats too
Personal well stop the tape
I hope I find what Im looking for maybe I should drink just a little more
Im fightin but Im losin feel like the author of confusion Hear me
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life and confusion seems to be my
Alibi Delusional Im feelin like I dont belong feel like Im tellin you to
They say Im seein things but everybody know Im bein things we dem kings
Like it or not we runnin this gotta lotta hype cause I wanna spit and I
Come to grip on the fith you gotta know techs never gonna miss I know I
Might be a little psycie but its nightly and brightly inside of me makin me
A little frightening rippin it with the right team I bring hella light when
Resighting when its all said and done Im sickened and heavened caused this

Im fightin but Im losin feel like the author of confusion Hear me
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life and confusion seems to be my
Alibi Delusional Im feelin like I dont belong feel like Im tellin you to

Who the hell is Satan
And why I gotta beem
So why you gotta seeem
When you look at me is it the Imagery
Its gotta godly evils not my energy
I pose as angels clothes is mangled
Instead of girbeaus and kangols
The hos still dangle I chose the angle
With foes those who stain
yo brain so bane though painful
Shit is what they like hit is what they might
Spit his stuff in life shit is fuckin tight
But some people think its an evil experiment
Some people is fearin it
those who do Beatles is hearin it
People who look and never listen
They thinkin that Im the tyranny of evil men
But I just tell it like it is dude
My life storys quite gory
spittin even if it is rude
So aint no brimstone I aint Jim Jones
So put your grins on listen to them songs
And you will see that they be classics
Verbal gymnastics you call me Lucifer
go to hell you bastard
They call me devil boy they call me devil boy
The way I come is sick
and Im on some other level boy
They call me devil boy they call me devil boy
Cause I am not the everyday
Im not no mellow boy
They call me devil boy they call me devil boy
And those who know me
yes they know that I am well annoyed
They call me devil boy if you call me devil boy
Youre going to all burn in hell
Hot Christians pop my disc in
Stop the dissin squat and listen
I never say hail Satan
Ill never bail out and sell out
and sell gay drama
Hey mama they trying to crucify me like Jesus
Religious groups deny me like skeezers
We mic pleasers rip it and write heaters
with quickness are light readers
I said Anghellic then let the man sale it
I let the fans smell it then I expand relish
But the devil tried to stop me thats JCOR
when its rocky and stay poor
Deus Vobiscum we playas go get some sprayers
And hitsem with layers of slayer inscriptions
That mean God be with you
we split dude then hit you
then giggle never dissing nizzle again
I talk about the rain I talk about the sun
about the pain I speak about the fun
Im sayin that Im bad Im sayin that Im good
Im saying this to the suburnites and every hood
Yaw act like Im sayin
I love Lucifer I will kill all of you
Mother Fucker I aint step into the lime light
To devil worship in front of kids
They call me devil boy
But I dont like that
Thats where the fights at
And Ill be right back
To the devil worshipers at my signings thinkin
I just wanna go to your parties
So I can run thru all your goth bitches
Takeem on the block and now they 2Pac bitches
I love the dark side with horror
You got hard lives
Missourah is our side
and its hella depressin hella a stressin
Retrogression back to depression
a hell of a lesson
This where it gets more sick
Who listen to this album and then say exorcist
You dense hence the word Ang it means good
you didnt catch it you should have
Idiots make me wanna bust it rebel toys
Tried to explain now I say fuck it several ploys
Foolish title I cant touch it devil boy

Is it true I can only fly so high
Without wings I truly die
If you trace it back to the beginnin
I never sold a single piece of music before Mitch Bade
This layed the foundation for me to get paid
This day you can still hear that gangster on a sick page
Now Im flyin high but dyin my
Fans that were buyin I
Does he have to get bigger and flow with artists from mainstream
Good music reaches all and hes creating a strange scene
How far up can I go
Before you say you love me
Im flying but Im dying faster
Hoping you wont go away
How the hell are you sayin that all the records Im playin
Since 2010 are not obeyin the Strange Law
Remain raw give your happy and pain all
Spit with a flame jaw with the teeth of a chainsaw
This what I do when Im flyin right off the shelf
And when something musical helps
You cant keep it all to yourself
It grows and grows always hard never tryin soft
So how in the world you fix your face to say that you dyin off
Frustrated cause Im thinkin that if enough hated
Itll make remaining fans start feelin their trust faded
I dont wanna die I just wanna keep my lifeline
And thats the family who recite N9nes passages
And back it just cause aint no other like mine tight rhymes
And even the people applaud
They still wanna bury hard cause they dont wanna be a god
Im higher than the stars now
The bottom is too far down
Whoever throws sand at the Nina
Yeah it kinda cuts but it aint enough to take me down
Ive been so true so things I do will go my way
With the power of the pen the paper the people do as I say
My fans are my lifeline so it kills me to think how they can just cut off
There can only be one
Thou shall only be me
And the whole worlds changing
Im flying higher more and more everyday
But lately Ive been feelin like I should just fly away
First entry for Sickology 101 Dysfunctional
Dont you bring me nothing stupid
If you dont want me to lose it
Step back if you dont want me to attack
Im a beast Better give me the deuces
I have no tolerance for nonsense
Me dont wanna get dollars
Dont wanna holler but you makin me
Youre the problem Please dont awakin me
And Im that way cause back in the day
Lodi dodi Im at the party
On a drunk night with a punk
Might dude wanna pick a fight because hes sorry
That he aint Gotti Like I be
Cause he sloppy Not me
Costly rocks be spot free
But he dont know Im roguish
And they be locked and loaded
Will explode if you cant hold us
And we dont got no scruples
We didnt come to fight and shoot you
But you busters better be mutual
Dont get loose because we cuckoo
Listen They call me genius I run the show
Woman be on my penis Its wonderful
Demons think they the meanest
But I brung the foe on the flow
Little bit sick Dont you know
Im a little dysfunctional Dont you know
If you push me It might be bad
Get a little emotional Dont you know
You could fool around and make me mad
Im a little dysfunctional Dont you know
If you push me It might be bad
Get a little emotional Dont you know
Might fool around and make me mad
Im a product of environment
So Ive been forced into retirement
But I make moves and I paid dues
And I got common sense
Since I cant lose and I cant choose
Then Ill come back to spit
I got hit songs but Ive been gone so long that I dont fit
Near death Dethrone but cant get on
So I need me a lick
I write these songs but dont belong
Im on some other shit
Im huntin leads in desperate need
I hope its comin quick
Id wrap my brain to find a lane
Thats gon bring me some change
But its so strange My life has changed
And I am not the same
I come around but since Im down
I try to hide it deep inside but Im dysfunctional
I never learned to hold it in
So please dont push to play me pussy
On some real shit Wont be defeated
Im a little dysfunctional Dont you know
If you push me It might be bad
Get a little emotional Dont you know
You could fool around and make me mad
Im a little dysfunctional Dont you know
If you push me It might be bad
Get a little emotional Dont you know
Might fool around and make me mad
I aint no killer but dont push me
QuQuQuQuiet boy never been no pussy
Could be carrying something up under my hoody
Course me never snap and kill a baller yall
Now I wanna be peaceful
But I carry Desert Eagles where ever black people are
You know how black people are
I peep em out Try to stay evened out
Wanna preach to em but their evil keep on seepin out
Emotions get the best of me
Messed up and then yall get the rest of me
Depressed and stressed Feel like my destiny
I know yall think less of me
Cause Im always sick and I cant let it be
Pharmaceutical soup be the best recipe
Its gon be the death of me
I need Depakote just to cope
While I keep throwin them pills down my throat
Smokin Bombay can give me Fung Shui
But I wish that it all would go away
Or maybe I should pray for Jesus Christ
Tryin to pray for change
But sometimes it feel like he lets it be
So I just take another couple doses
Probably be fine but if you get too close
Youll find out that I
Im a little dysfunctional Dont you know
If you push me It might be bad
Get a little emotional Dont you know
You could fool around and make me mad
Im a little dysfunctional Dont you know
If you push me It might be bad
Get a little emotional Dont you know
Might fool around and make me mad

Gimme women and much alcohol
Angels come in many shades

Living crazy is the only way

Gettin greeted with a stretch
And were leaving nothing left
Have em breathing last breaths
When I hold this dick

Yum a stick of 5 gum is the taste on my tongue
But for the right one I’ll spit it out and place her right on
The night’s young meaning we minus the bright sun
And I’m numb like I’m inside ‘em like white on a ripe bun
Like that one baby stacked wit’ a fat one
Actionpack wit’ a rack and a little bit of that ‘yac she’s passed on
Got a 36pack of Magnums I’m Vlad and I’m back
I’ll put a bitch in a sack and bring her back
And then I gotta go and leave a lash from the passion
I’m crazy Sick as hell for the ladies
They don’t give a damn that I’m manic
Even though I’m so shady
Baby girl but don’t play me
I ain’t tryna have no babies but baby
You braised in some slavery
Wanna excite ya ignite the fight so honey taunt me
I just wanna bite you and watch you drip out RomaneeConti
That’s 11 Gs angel from heaven she’s
Seven threes hot egg and cheese for Pain Tech and Weez
I know what you sayin’
But you know I ain’t playin’
Tryna get my dick sucked through my jeans
Girl sure look like fuck food to me
Girl sure look like fuck food to me
Spin that booty ’round drop it to the ground let it make a sound dodo it baby
Do it like that lemme see the kittykat then I hit it from the back for the baby
Girl sure look like fuck food to me
Girl sure look like fuck food to me
Uh now put that pussy on my lip and dip
Yeah let’s make a movie I’ma flip the script

And I like ‘em all colors multimack can make ‘em all love us
And make ‘em do all of us and we don’t be trippin’ on it ’cause we all brothers

Back up wait a minute
Why you looking at me like that
Do you really wanna trip are you flipping the script
Do you wanna rap with a nigga
Are we bangin so whoop in a rip
I dont ever want us to come the bustin off shots nigga misery cant produce enough cops and
Dont know if you willin or what
All you wanna do is freestyle in the cut
Fan or foe I dont really know
Off at the show niggas they know
what I look like was a good night
now its looking like a motherfucker wanna jack all me doe
My kids would be chillin
Better think twice Im a 56 villain
All they wanna talk about
Man I thought I was gonna get a bullet in a minute
You should be careful how you walk upon us
Got a bonus for all the opponents if they want it
I know they wait for Tecca Ninna moments
Till the opponent be poppin up and hes you dont it
We dont if they be tripin or not no
Probably cause all of them live on the block
When youre rapping niggas know what you got
Toughest ever when you up on the top
Show some respect when you approach me
Dont you be mugging me
Might have that drug in me
Plugging a nigga for nearly shrugging me
Aint nothing wrong with people peeping geeking
But the grandma so bama stama
I dont know if you fan or foe
If he trippin we can go
Peeping like hes seeking doe
Want to throw or want to poe
I dont know if you fan or foe
I dont know if you fan or foe
I dont know if you fan or foe
Easy how youre speakin bro
I dont know if you fan or foe
If he trippin trippin go
Want to throw or poe poe
I dont know if you fan or foe
I dont know if you fan or foe
I dont know if you fan or foe
I dont know if you fan or foe
Now be easy how youre speakin bro
TNutty a young flow heathin dont be chokin
So your ass and youll be walkin off with it broken
Run up on motherfuckers in the open
Woofing with that cold shit
Nigga you think this is with manikans
Thinking youre slicker than lotion
Back up wait a minute why youre looking at me like that
Im just a nigga with a little bit of fame but if you get the tripping than Im giving up my game
You can get it out your brain
Some kinda nigga tryin to get his hands on my doe
But if you really want come on
And try to get on you can be the opponent chokin with hands on your throat
Wantin a background for Sac Town
Better watch out from the Blao Blao
Black out black out black out black out braararararaa ttataaaaa
Stay with my killers that be knockin noodles
Wakin the game the blood at goca doodle
Thinkin youre gonna catch me slippin at a show
Fear factor click is like a shaker Zulu
With all that fake shit
Hoping and wishin you was my replacement
Coming so vicious youre gonna have to face it
And try to taste it
cause I laced it like a tennis shoe when Ive been a fool
Like Zeepo bitch and XRaided
But this is a different interview
It might not be a bad idea
If I never go home again
cause niggas be lookin at me
Like Im a chicken dinner
Like like Im Henderson
You a foe foe so I gotta carry the fo four
And did they recognize me I dont really know though
cause they walkin up fast
When they pass me asking
When your new shit come out me and my dogs
And the be huddled up and got me I think Im gonna pick one out and get the nigga bigger than me
For the trigger to see
Make it what he trying to be
But hes a fan though
Dont know how to approach you vulture
Get to close how Im supposed to
supposed to know the difference between fan or foe when youre muggin on me
Cant even live in peace
And when I eat with my peeps In the place
You in my face with your mixtapes
And if I aint tryin to listen to it
We get in to it
If Im off on the fluid
Then its time to do it do it
Uhhhh cause a nigga from out south out the mouth
Your girl be loving me giving me mouth to mouth yeah
And it aint fair that the music got her doing what she wanna do when you aint there
And youre too softy softy when you see me you better get up off me
Chorus RepeatLyrics submitted by Josh
Show this stressful everybody wanna call
Gotta tell em now sometimes
Sit up in the record store
Seven hundred fans man everyone signs
And it gets so hard telling em all please try to form one line
I dont think you know
How much of a strain its been
But I wouldnt give up a thang
And resort to brain trippin
I need a little release
Something to stop my rage
I really need me a moment of peace
So baby girl wanna step on stage
Girl take off your bra
Talking to all of you all
This is a party call
Theres song aint about your
But I really love it when you
If you want me we can
I can see them from the front row to the back
And its beautiful Ive imagined this
Since I was a you now that Im
Even if you an Acup girl we can still play touch
If you a B and C cup girl I bet you could make me erupt
D Cups be the ones that are driving me nuts
Big breasts never trouble me
If you packing the double D
Let everyone S double E
Angelina Jolie let me see those
Beautiful babies Im all about the tedos
Miss Jackson packing them holy toledos
Missed the flash cause I didnt have Tivo
Ask me whos finer player Im gonna yell Tyra
Little sick in the head still got the magazine of El Vira
Life is so grand when you got your fans
Blasting off their shirts flashing their Lindsay Lohans
I got a pocket full of Trojans
We can all get nasty if you flash me baby
Girls in the back come to the front
Cause we in need of cleavage
And Ive been looking at you
Yep you and your home girl
Let me see both of them now grab a hold of them
Look at what youre doing to me
Now grab a hold of him
Ah such a nice sensation
You know the dogs been waiting
For you to quickly take off your Vickie
And show me your augmentation
Either one puts me in a day dream
Talking about it gets me way steamed
When you see me baby lift it up
Thinking Im gonna miss it nigga what
if I miss one back it up
From city to city crazy
From city to city crazy
Traveling for miles and miles
Girls gone wild love this peculiar style
So in order for us to get our head right

I wanna give give it all
I said I said I said I said
I wanna try to kill everything in my way
Everybody say hey ey ey ey ey
Yep Im the one ya heard
Reppin rojo on Jimmy Kimmel had some disturbed
But niggas know that we ruff and rugged so mums the word
Tech N9na face painted look like he come ta purge
Real scorpio shoot this thing like a Torpedo
Rock the rip no remorse we go
Dummy like Mork from Ork we know
And I say that with the utmost respect
I bust low to death I must bode the check
Its never enough no for Tech
So I get sick with it I make a bitch dig it
Even when I wanna speed it up and I quickspit it
I get a bit wicked up in a battle
Tryin to bite a buck I blabber in his fitted
Killin music get me spiff sitted I cant piss when it become hard
So I need a chick to hit it when I kick a lyric
And Im a murder til Im on the yard Murder
My verbs are like birds that jerk up and merk the weak twerps
You cant hurt the durka
First to insert the work inside of the earth
I disperse the curse to reverse ya to the worst of ya venomous
Trip not you see I got the advantage in hip hop
Cause rappers sound identical so when N9nas shit drop
I do numbers Im the pinnacle so never will it stop
Yall cant beat me doin nothing except for
Stalkin these thoughts I spew and suckin
We run this independent game it aint no screwin us
When we runnin everything except our mouth while they blue and sufferin
This on the Bible I kill any life with a script from this rhyme
Musics done divine this is my rifle
There arent any like it cause this one is N9ne is a gift from his mind
Yo I Got the call from Tech N9ne
He needed assistance from the group with the best rhymes
That spit the heat up off of yo ass and grind
Fuck all of them flex rhymes
I get love in every city I sack in cause I rep mine
Around the world the girls give me head on tour cause I headline
I gotta get fed Im fed up my homies is doin fair time
I look at that clock and all I see is Go get that bread time
Lost too many soldiers so tears I gotta shed mine
Turn on the radio hear yo shit and oh its bedtime
I fall asleep it all is weak most yall shouldnt be called MCs
Bro ya discography you aint sale cause all of ya talk is cheap
Smoke up all the tree my whip look like it got a fog machine
My crib look like a pharmacy thats prolly why you wanna haul my team
Livin facetious what the hell why the weed lit
I make change where I see fit
I dont play like I dont see shit
Yeah one hunnit one hunnit keep it that way and its a poem
And stay away from the hate and keep all yo plays right in motion
Bust it Im down after the sun and up before it better know it
MVP most valuable poet been the coldest kept it focused
Cause you miss every goal you dont shoot for
And every time you cut a corner you make two more
The rich is in my life so I dont have to have the things
And listen for the whispers so I dont have to hear the screams
And I go hard for what I want so its just colors when I dream
And then you realize its not as scary as it seems
Aint nobody handle me heated like a candle be
Kissin dirt ya manll be for tryin to dismantle me
Music is my weapon true loud enough to deafen you
Never trip with Tech and crew be careful who you steppin to
I remember when I was young and I got scars through
Right in back of the paddywagons and cop cars too
Now that Im flyin high from a rockstar view
Security level let Allahu Akbar through
Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this cant be paradise
When you walk dont come my way
And dont dare honk at me when you drive
Im The Grinch I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise
I cant stand yo persona the drama yo marijuana or yo momma
I really despise yo am a so comma I disapo who you honor
I see what you people can offer I wonder what mommy taught ya
If it was up to me the G I wanna sought ya caught ya and then offed ya
I hate what you become hate you have your freedom
Hate watchin your reruns hate givin you refunds
I call em how I see em when I see scum I free from the legions
Cerebrum I see none see your just really dumb
Hate seein your whores hate cleanin your floors
Hate doin your chores wont be in your awards
Funk bein your whore hunks bein of course you punks being endorsed Chumps being assured dumped being divorced
To test you like a sickness I bet youd like to lick this
From Texas right to Memphis built with ex dykes and glimpses
Of everything I hate it would be great for you to skate off in a lake
A beautiful fate I hope nobody is at yo wake
Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this cant be paradise
When you walk dont come my way
And dont dare honk at me when you drive
Im The Grinch I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise
Were livin in the cold age road rage
Dark no sole no way
Jose Cuearvo there goes yo day
Every scare everywhere knows bogay
This life is too soft haters more true talk
I hate the way that you cough hate you when you blew off
You coofa your crueler so cool off
If we were arm and arm in handcuffs my arm I would rather chew off
So many reasons why I cant stand you
The man whos scam is to ban you
Cram you in the can under land in Grand View
Damn you if you stand near my farm I slam you
Sammain champaign your family and you
Im a monster when it comes to you conquer every one of you
Trade tours paid for your neighbor
Cause they whores pray for decor
Cause your state will create race wars
Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this cant be paradise
When you walk dont come my way
And dont dare honk at me when you drive
Im The Grinch I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise
I hate you when you destroy buildings and kill millions of children
From black white Chinese Sicilian I thrill
When you feel sin dealin drugs to billions
Awaiting your death miserable until then
I wanna put my Rebox and get on top of his esophagus
And watch the Appocolypse drop him in Necropolis
Never was menogamus doggin is youre botherin all of us
Gotta get loose from those to ex to soddomus
I hate what you stand for hate all your scandals
When your lifes baned for I will not burn a candle
The way you live is not easy to handle
You vandals toss 666 in your blood sample
Yo the world is very different now no more hugs
Just shrugs and crips and bloods and drugs
Not see show no love never we be equal
My name is The Grinch this song is dedicated to the evil people
Look away from me when you see me

They said I was a narcissist haha The narcissistest Trick Yeah Strange Music baby
Hey Im lookin down on you niggas
Even though Im 58″ 195 pound on you niggas
So tall I cant even hear any of the sound you deliver
Me and my partners never see any of the hateful frowning you give us
Cause we splat little bitty braggin wack rappers
You happen to be the bastard that got mashed up
Adapt to the simple fact heres a strap at ya blast at ya
Thats after the gap when I put the cash in my last chapter thats laughter
Had passed a vast money bag imagine a black Dracula
Smashin em with the gas upper class stature
It went to my head as my first time
To be cocky Im just a giant when I burst rhyme
My leg is humongous is yalls verse mine
Step on the mic I cant stop my leg like Robert Klein
Giant robot make you feel very low shaint
I am so hot in my skills there be propane
Why Im gon squash them and kill every poor thang
Cause Im a huge Pillsbury dough mane
Narcissistic hard to grip it
Dark and wicked arts prolific
Mars with the stars this is far lifted
Lyrics quit the Bawitdaba scriptures are terrific
Get a spitter with a bit of bitter marketed
With scrilla then a fifth of Henny liquor start to twist it
Critters sit and shiver in the slit of zillas
Pit of killers gritters hit a click of silly niggas are fictitious
On top of the game Im dropping the rain Godly gifted
Hop in your lane and stopping your fame bark is vicious
You got bars to witness yall submissive
When I get your brain your thoughts is shifted
Im incredible highly technical meant for triumph raw intricate
I need medical then more science scars and stitches
Alphabetical gems blow by him pause it a bit
Tech N9ne a mental giant
Mentally Im like Shaq on stilts
Strange Music Inc is white and black on built
For keeping rap on tilt
Like drinking Patron and Jack prone then yack on silk quilts
Got a fat dome thatll last long if thats where Im skilled
Giant huge humongous gigantic expanded
Been floating for years and I aint landed
Haters cant stand it the way that my noggin is big as Kansas
But the women that listen wanna know if Im talking bout my damn dick
Yadda they think my head big Ask her if my head big Haha yadda Yeah Tech N9neLyrics submitted by alex juggalo
We been doing this for a long long time now
this music thing and touring yknow
and still I aint met one person that could maintain righteousness
Verse 1 Tech N9ne
A wise man told me evil was lurkin and if you found it
try your best to not put yourself around it
Cuz when you in it you tend to push it to the limit but
then when the sin beginnin you wish you would stay grounded
I went all over the world and I done been through it
at the beginning I knew I wouldnt give in to it
but temptation over the sensation
women Im embracin so many of them waitin
Contemplatin how to get fornication
at yo door when its late with the motivation of Satan
so they say but things go they way
but its more then pay told her hey yo the phase for today
But lust it sets in and crush your chest in
for dust your destined if drugs are let in
Enough to nest in probably make you punch your best friend
and next kin cuz you let sex win
You mean to tell me you can fight this land
with brightness and walk the path of the righteous man
Yo I want to believe that itching to see that
if a positive person can shake the negative feedback
that this life has to offer what its faster
What a disaster if you didnt obey the master
Cuz thats mutiny it would be new to me
if you was on tour with Tecca Nina and still you could be
Chorus Krizz Kaliko Strange Lane Choir
Holy holy If you lived in another world would you
Know me know me I know you be strong but you been gone a
While I know you still my
Child So Im pullin for you
Dont you owe me Your soul and if you know it wont
Show me show me You can see me if you look above the
Thou So I say it for you
Verse 2 Krizz Kaliko
How can I move the crowd without losin out of my faith
Lucifer out of the way way
Or maybe he dont even exist
I aint gotta trip off
Gettin hookers out of my system get you out of my system
See thats how he tricks em
Get em sippin then a big ol mickey he slips them I wonder why
Music soothes the savage soul
People could lose or win but lack control
Wish we could choose to live and fast the soul
We smashin women then bypass the soul
They believin everything we breathe in
Half of us is Jesus the other half is heathen
And how we get that bad half out
We pray the lord would cast that out
Hope you got blessins let them pass that out
When we travellin and pass that route
Keep us under their grace is the place where we had that doubt
Where I stand its pointin at me but its with my hand
I need you you holier than I am I am
Chorus Krizz Kaliko Strange Lane Choir
Holy holy If you lived in another world would you
Know me know me I know you be strong but you been gone a
While I know you still my
Child So Im pullin for you
Dont you owe me Your soul and if you know it wont
Show me show me You can see me if you look above the
Thou So I say it for you
Verse 3 Tech N9ne
This verse was intended for a gospel rapper that we all admire
and he goes by the name of Da TRUTH
All we wanted was a righteous man to lead us in the right direction
and maybe if he came we could change and regroup
So we laid it down and sent it hopin we would rap wit us track splittas
Waited and none of his people got back wit us
We kept callin and they finally answered when a month passed
We was prepared to do whatever give it if he wants cash
but the lady who represent em would never send em a message from a secular messenger
Never be no nepotism we supposed to be brothers on the road to teach others
but the flow would be covered dont wanna mess with Tech they know that we smothered
anybody who diss us retire they weak flow
Cuz this is the pinnacle nobody flyer than me bro
If you didnt like it then I admire the ego
And if they never told ya then you better fire ya people
Cause fallen angels came for your help and then she pushed em
but Christians be the first to run they mouth about Muslims
but they always helpin in the hood but yall closed me out
yall didnt even really wanna know what we bout
And we bombay trippin on this on the don spay
and I had to spit on in cuz I couldnt afford Kanye
I needed help your people showed me the wall
be lowly as yall I guess yall wasnt holy at all naw
Much love to the gospel MC
J Blast for coming down in the midst of sinners to try to help us remedy our situation
Even though most if his peers told him not to
Thanks for giving me Da TRUTH CD and bringing true Godliness to our circle bro
God bless you for being so
Chorus Krizz Kaliko Strange Lane Choir
Holy holy If you live in another world would you
Know me know me I know you be strong but you been gone a
While WHILE I know you still my
Child CHILD So Im pullin for you
Dont you owe me Your soul and if you know it wont
Show me show me You can see me if you look above the
Clouds CLOUD Youre holier than
Thou THOU So I say it for you
Holy holy If you lived in another world would you

I want to party Huh
You want to party Yeah
We need to party Cool
Lets have a party Lemme get up
Saturday mornin I aint gotta work
Last nights show sold a lot of merch
Bad bitch in my bed so I aint gotta jerk
Forbes List caught me so its hard to make the dollar hurt
All we need is good green and some Bou Lou
Five to one so its guaranteed you can do you
Zilla keep the heater just in case we have a booboo
Kansas City natives and we all a little coocoo
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
On the interstate doin 180
She said do it for me baby
Took a double shot and then we all went crazy
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
So much liquor I never spare that kitchen
Keep it so I usually have a pair thats kissin
And Im lifted on purple hair thats bitchin
Now thats what I call a fuckin air Technician
Down there they got the hair thats missin
Keep it bare I promise Ill never tear that kitten
I am aware sex hittin is the care when I share that stick and
So good I might impair that vision
So I dip in then dip off
Look for another chick then they pissed off
Till I give them another spliff then they lift off
Party is the mission I did cross
Three thick friends we mixin these licks when
They big friend wanna lip off
So I told her come and get lost bitch
This my place and its way too turnt up to trip off shit
My fourth foreign car was a Porsche photo white
Cooler than a polar bear in a bowl of ice
With a ring married to the game had em throwin rice
Wait a minute put my thing in her
Im trynna knock up Im trynna put a singer in her
So I can do a banger with her
I get brain for dinner
I dont need to put tender for contender
High top with zippers hard as some nipples
All the shit I do is straight off the temple
Trynna squeeze it into my schedule is like a pimple
Tell that poodle dont mess around with them pitbulls
This the endin from the N9ne
If you way drunk off the yac
Spit it up spit it up spit it up
This Kansas City shits ran gritty
In the summer time the chicks be damn pretty
Born in the projects then to the Ville
Then I did a deal with Travis and made mills
This is celebration this is elevation
Me and my delegation got niggas hella hatin
This is Nnutthowze Regime Rogue Dog
And its all Strange Music winners cant lose it unless
Errbody got they hands up like Oooh
See a bad bitch like Wooah
This whole damn city fuckin go
But this is how the hood go crazy in the MO

Damn my brand new Benz
Thinkin of my socalled friends
Why should I make amends when they crossed the nina and Sin again and again and again
I love them dearly but hear me they burn severely Im weary to the point that I really dont want not one one of them none of them near me
Did trust you but whats new for real Yeah I love you but fuck you for real
I love you but fuck you x3
Kinda strange how you came at me
I love you but fuck you x3
Things will never be the same with me
Met you at a rock show November No Octo
Took pictures then locked yo numbers and then got low
Called you up a lot though found out that you not a hoe
Several trips to my show shot me with your crossbow
We used to kick it at patswhitesand blacks triple stacks and fat sacks we matched we relaxed the kiss but I never twist her she wish for the better mister I mixed the lady with my kid but then miss she became my sister for a minute
But then my lady started receiving that snitch by that nigga on tour you wanna be the reason that split you started believing that bitch in San Jose you grip to what the damn ho say you flip like a maam who stayed no trips never send your pay We dipped
Used to play for you even used to pray for you Never that cause you wanted to spit in my face and that was up up up and away for you I hate this I was real so why fake shit You lost us so go fuck them bitches on myspaces
I love you but fuck you x3
Kinda strange how you came at me
I love you but fuck you x3
Things will never be the same with me
Everyshow was a different face but these two were from a different place
Follow my tour gotta quickembrace never wouldve thought Id have to give them space
Father and daughter loved me to death Never cared their blood be the sin
Just lovin the tech Shrugged the regret Then found out papa couldnt have the husband effect
Everybody seened it but didnt believe everybody got it but never did I receive it
His dream was for me to fuck miss thing But she looked 15 baby girl was 19
But Instead of givin the dick Id rather give her ice cream Now Im trippin cause her pops just tryin to auction her off
But it turns out he was knockin her off I had to stop and I coughed cause that baby turned out to be the boyfriend Guess he was givin him a little bit extra when he brought the toys in
Yall lied to me did it fuck with the Nina sho it did
Yall made me question what your motive is
Dont cry Ali but my temper is flared and scared off
So to see you I guess Ill see you in the crowd like wheres waldo
I love you but fuck you x3
Kinda strange how you came at me
I love you but fuck you x3
Things will never be the same with me
I love you cause you married me when I needed therapy
Let me move in with you be my wife you wasnt scared of me
But fuck you because you say if you dont get a job today
Better kick rock wasnt hard to say when you knew Id rap my heart away
I love you cause you sexy love you cause youre beautiful
Love you cause way back in the day you thought that I was suitable
But fuck you treated me stupid and conceitedly
I wasnt very smart but a genius you wanted me to be
I love you cause you strong I love you cause you real
Because you forgave me when I cheated and poppin pills
But fuck you for bringin up shit that happened years ago
Chances of us getting back is gunna take a miracle
You live in the past Im givin the gas and cash
How many niggas did that without you givin the ass
And I ask you what other nigga would step up with the love to give her
Gs in the house for you and the kids and even for your other nigga
Enjoy the dough you get cause I dont owe you shit
You was unhappy with me so you split
You need to show me some love ma and I dont mean that I wanna fuck you
Just acknowledge me taking care of you because Ill Ill
I love you but fuck you x3
Kinda strange how you came at me
I love you but fuck you x3

If you see me lookin clean cut
Matchin from head to toe dippin with a mean strut
Throwin and blowin green stuff hella creamed up with a bling cup
Aint no wicked we can kick it if you blue or beamed up
If you see me step off in the clubber with some pros
With about 6 of em cut no longer waiting to be chose
And if you hear me tell my homies anything goes
With these chickens dippin to Davys right when the clubber close
If you see me on the grind getting mine
If you bust in the room and find me hittin yours from behind
If you hear me bustin rhymes rippin each and every time
If I got it at capacity and you still got a line
If Im rollin on dubs if its KTown bud
If they showin me love with a red rug at the club
If you see them hatas giving me mugs ladies giving me hugs
It aint no rocket science its because
Oh oh Im a playa
Im a playa in every sense of the word ya heard
Im getting money from these dummies flip your chick so absurd
Im a playa and I pop collars
Im a playa when I dont or when I do drop dollars them rot weilders
She dont want no softy sayin he do when he dont
She dont want no perpetrating 9 to fiver trying to flaunt
She dont want no punk that cant get it krunk
No she dont thats how it go so my homie Kaliko tellem what she want
She want a playa not thugs on dubs
We be rollin them 22s and 3s pop ludes and Vs
Im in hot pursuit of a prostitute Kaliko knock boots gots lots to shoot
Im pullin out the latex and given it to whos next
And foolem pull a brewnet wit unforgettable sex
Shes oohinoohin sweat and I aint telling whos wet
And I aint getting loose yet so whos next 4 group sex
Oh oh Im a playa
Listen closely this is something you might not know
Never ever tell ya love where else you get your love
Move in groups no one on one when you hit the club
And you should know this if you call yourself a wicked thug
If you creep to the movies throw away your ticket stub
If you sexin learn this lesson when you wash off
Just use hot water dont put no soap on your wash cloth
That way when you get home no questions you wont leave her bent
Dont be a dope and use the soap cause it will leave a scent
Dont tell a 2 that shes your one and only
Cause if she know its way easy to go her own way
If you taking chickens to your secret home hey
Always go the back way to confuseem just take the long way
To all the ladies if you playin throw ya hands up
To all my fellas if you playin throw ya grands up
This is 4eva baby having clever thangs Im a playa
Mother fucker and I bet Ill never change
Oh oh Im a playa

KC MO stand up young niggaz represent
Ask me what i wanna be when i grow up
I aint just gonna blow up ima star i got stryums Tryin to get it closa
telescopes to cameras rappas wanna use Blammas but
Im gleemin from the planets homie mine is called Kansas City
A cloud in my pocket got a rain on em
such a star i saw heavens walls an wrote my name on em
So comfortable at the top i hopped on a plane an
clamed Everest you might as well say the boys Himalyian
I rent my rooms on the moon Mr Smiths comin soon
The angels feedin my cereal with a silver spoon
My hairline is Craig Smith airlines arrive from
kansas city through LA as long as a fan line
im high as though eight gas prices my votes are
twice as high as Obamas an i aint gotta ask nice
im high aspects tour bus the light skinned ones
So if your lookin for me bow an look up an try an find the sun
IM IN THE AIR
Ya dont me to brag but i froze my piece
an i gettin high then a nose bleed see
dont bring it to my seesion if ya hoe see me
Shell drop dead in the studio like ODB
Ya its the owna an im very coo
Plus this weeds keep me higher than air balloon
CopyCat like what im wearin dude

an even rappas like 2 but im the only human
with an astronaut suit see your entire verse

Or bring they ass up like a paper clip
Tech signed me an see how quick your paper flips
HIGH IN THE AIR
IM IN THE AIR
I gotta have this one by myself you know what it is
Why call me underground when i rock the stars
an even they cant even see me with a pair of binoculars
my hiphoppin gave them ga side swipe to mars
bump thur then extinction hit which left the lime like ajar
you want your scripts to fly not in my solar system
cuz i dismiss them like they wish to die
Maga then nature and i rip the why
civilian ladies love me so bro excuse her while she kiss the sky
call me masta more exaulted then a priest to paster
blasphamy had me blast fags fast with maga
in the air like dancer an dasha high in the
sky up above mountains up off in alaska
higher than a million heroine hits of fits to last ya

the wackaual castya down below who get caught up in my rapture

IM IN THE AIR

Threw her in the trunk
But her mouth was hella fast
So I threw her ass in the trunk
And even though she had a big plump rump
I threw her in an let the beat bump through her in the trunk
In the benz on the twins hella low pro
Slingin CDs out the trunk of modo
My mojo said a thick bitch so I go slow
I pull it over tryin to get up on her bumper
wantin to crunch her so I baby my new CD is a slumper
Itll make the trunk thunder
Girl your rump give me lumber
Up under the sheets I can put you in a real deep slumber
She said fuck Tecca Nina didnt feel her
Did everything within my power not to kill her
Disrespectful bitch I really wish that I can grill her
Light on my head said that said put her in the trunk man you can steal her
I put the hater bitch in a head lock
I pop the trunk she crunk but Im aint bout to chicken out
Im sick and tired of bein nice and lettin shit go by
She said fuck that Tech N9ne bullshit so I
Threw her in the trunk
But her mouth was hella fast
So I threw her ass in the trunk
And even though she had a big plump rump
I threw her in an let the beat bump through her in the trunk
Im bumpin everything that beat like gangsta shap
I bangs the rap in her ear til she gives thanks to that
Never take a prisoner where you hang your hat
Imma roll around wit her in the trunk
Poppin that Tech N9ne slump til the little bitch faint collapse
Tecca Ninall reach her if I gotta double back to Eureka
Crispy flows through my tweetas
Bumpin this ring when I roll through a teeta
Wait a minute I think this bitch is trying to kick a hole through my speakas
Get my gun then I open the trunk and said
Get out the God damn trunk OK
Get on the God damn ground Take off your God damn belt Put it around your ankles Imma tie up your wrists myself OK OK
I just wanted some drank n shit What wrong with you
The hell wrong with you
The hot sex was not slam dunk
Rode for hours then I stop right off van brun
When a bitch talkin crazy like a lost mans chump
Shode say I throw bitch in the God damn trunk
Threw her in the trunk
But her mouth was hella fast
So I threw her ass in the trunk
And even though she had a big plump rump
I threw her in an let the beat bump through her in the trunk
Had to drill holes in the trunk so she could drink n eat
Whatever I stuff through the holes
Hot dogs n hohos
Kidnapped on a low low spoke no mo
Oh no go slow there the popo
Man I just remembered this Benzo was lifted
From Swope Park thats where Im about to go dart
For the evil bitch and the brainless witch with no heart
Police are still looking for 21year old Crystal Nelson who has been missing since last Sunday
Friends and family told police they thought this was yet another one of Crystals weekend excursions
But after all this time theyre still worried sick
Fed her my catalog like adderall
Fucked up in the trunk with rump is how I had her yall
Walked back to the trunk
Wicked is how I sounded
Whispered Bet that you love Tech N9ne now bitch
Threw her in the trunk
Uh I think I found the missing Mercedes here in Swope Park uh in a ditch near shelter 5
Uh it appears the car is still running Um musics playing
Um Im approaching the car now um let me turn down the music
Um Im gonna go ahead and pop the trunk
Theres an AfricanAmerican female in the trunk

I was chillin wit a bitch
and i was noticing she was so sadistic
Wanted the Nina to bite on her nipples and twist it
Sucking me off until she lost all of her lipstick
You know how it is when you Xing on like 7 of em
Wit a stick of Sherm and Adderall nigga had to love em
Cause they get you lifted and thinkin you unstoppable
But what Im bout to tell you is so fuckin impossible
I started giving the bitch my dick
She loving the way my jimmy be jabbin it
Wanted me to cut her up I said never
She said imagine it with the tip of her butcher knife
I think i took her life
This crazy hooker like pain then i put her right
Fuckin high and its insane how she look at life
She wish a nigga had fangs and he took a bite
Im beating it up wit an aim what the pussy like
The pussy like to be banged like it took a fight
Then she asked me to smack her
Then she asked me to choke her
So i choked her As a nigga got closer to the nut I choked her
Even harder as i when i rose up out the Chocha
She wasnt breathing A horrible evening
Couldnt get her to breath I really tried ta
Did all i could of
I dont be finding trouble It be finding me
I dont be finding trouble It be finding me
I dont be finding trouble It be finding me
I dont be finding trouble It be finding me
I dont be finding trouble It be finding meplayed backwards
I dont be finding trouble It be finding meplayed backwards I dont be finding trouble It be finding meplayed backwards
I dont be finding trouble It be finding meplayed backwards
Shit i was only 16 just showing off
Never woulda imagined the gun going off
I was just trying to show these niggaz that i wasnt soft
Stayed at 52nd street so thats what all these niggaz thought
Cause they was from hilltop where niggaz pill pop
So im pulling up to the chill spot
still not sure what I was thinking
And back then I wasnt even drinking
So Im leaving Lincoln High School off Woodland
Headed to the hood to hang out wit all the hoodlums
Couldnt wait to show him what I was packing
Knock on the door he answered like Whuuss Crackin
I said Shit just chillin just me and my bitch
By my bitch I mean that 450 sittin on my hip
Wanna see He said yeah let me see
I pulled it out and gave it a quick squeeze
I didnt know it didnt have no safety
Now this man is hit in his chest and he cant breath
Devil on my shoulder whispering Leave nigga Leave
I dont be finding trouble It be finding me
I dont be finding trouble It be finding me
I dont be finding trouble It be finding me
I dont be finding trouble It be finding me

Wanna live in my world you have to have a Tech tat
Preferably the number N9ne and you gotta get it where the back of you necks at
Gotta let me know that you rep that plus get you out of a death trap
You need it for living cause Im the king
And Im giving you the permission to get with a no stress pack
That was ordos at chlorum acuse the old world orders
Post mortem disfailure inhaling cell and delta
Watched it swell and swelter till there was no male in shelter
Yes Im the one that provided ya shell in Hell and held ya
When your politicians were welters
So I built this structure just to help ya
So the communists can come and quell ya
They call me the King of Darkness when I offer you no pain
Why would they label me heartless when your love is my cocaine
And your soul is my rogaine I have a thirst to know your brain
When you enter my domain gotta take this number for your name
But you dont have to drink cyanide Im gonna be right by ya side
If we gotta take that riot ride on the enemy adn defy your side
Fight for the place were building for the preroduction of more children
Trying to get that number back around 6 billion Im gonna rule until then
Founded this colony like a pilgrim
Anybody try to penetrate this section or threaten we KILL THEM

What if he is what he says he is

This women need to be living by it
Stay fit n way driven paste it and dye it
I am the king killer captain crazed frigging pilot
Giving you these khaki pants and white shirt thats what you wear on my Earth
Eliminating your eye thirst to have any kind of desires
To envy material or admire my way will extract any type of divider
Understanding of life and tiredly blissfully vading friction and fire cha
The number N9ne will get you food even get you tools
To build anything your family choose but within my rules
All white shoes with red strings for all my crews
That lets me know you Techs people listening inside my pews
All your dreams and aspirations
That you can reach em and my world is not a disaster waiting
The ruses and lacerations no chooses of aggravation
Im just tryna rehab a nation from exasperation
Its not an exaggeration Im something more than your blood and gore
On a level higher than devils or that of Satan
What I did Anghellic I was good and bad straight confused
Then an angel turned to Devil Boy when the Reperation blew
Them demons had Absolute Power when I drug abused
So the angels searched through the Vintage Tech what they found was the love was through
Then an accident would happen that made life necessary
So now receiving God the angel was Everready
But the Melancholy strikes the eleven angels mommys life
So the Mizery sat in the angels now becoming ice
As mom got Ill and iller when it hurts her he can feel her
To the strain of the pain made of bane theres no more angels straight up KILLER
My apologies its not very God of me
To go crazy and try to teach the whole world Sickology
I was then split in two back to the beginning view
Angel demon cause the killer showed me death was overdue
But I gotta live for my kids all the eveil stuff I did
Taught me to teach you you can love then no matter how much sluts you did
Or dug you met my demon back when I had that grudge
But I gotta let you know most of my spirit comes from up above
Im mostly angel and you know sometimes we fall
Living under God and I hope hes listening when I say I love you allLyrics submitted by mitch

I was born in november 8th day 1971st yall
9 oclock in the mornin a christian girl in kansas city gave birth yall
She taught the kid how to love and give all praises to our maker till the earth fall
Then mama married a muslim when I was 12 and that transition was the worst yall
I converted to Islam but every once in awhile I read a bible verse yall
How am I to refrain from eatin pork and havin christmas when I thirst all
All of this it was blended many religions plenty women got my shirt yall
At home no longer attended when I was 17 I bounced like a nerf ball
My day I slay pie may trick dont get a bitch hit questionable
Im mastering it Im flyin around with equipment
Really big time and now Im not fittin this bitch
Im ridin around and Im grittin it
To the people the people that want the evil Im givin you that and a couple others a KLUSTERFUK
Of a brother which you discover to KRUSHMUCKSUP
In the gutter cause Im a thug and they TOUGHJUSTSTRUCK
On you MUUHFUCKAS Ill be the BLOOD BROTHA givin you LOVE FROM the SLUG if you BUG on a NIGGA
TUG on a trigger no HUGS Im a kiss her with GRUNGES and PLUG her with DRUGS when I give her
Fatherly when I spit on these kiddies dont bother me
In the brown and red dickies Mahogany
Red all over me like I hit an artery
Fuck all of these hypocrites lick a dick Just swallow me
If you follow me and wanted to abolish me
When Im honestly a straight oddity
Im just twisted nonfictitious on this wicked shit spit it big quick
Ready whenever machete will sever the head or be dead up in the lake or in the metal and big thick bricks
Pucker up suck this nutter butter gutter slut
If you wonder what is uttered this is KLUSTERFUK
Ever seen a nigga with hella followers and they love a nigga so much he be wantin to tell them to kill

Killa we KRUNK N FUNKY
Uhh BOOTY BITCHES IN THE BUNK WITH A DONKEY EH
Crazy I might be way in my psyche laid as a bright pa

Call it a bust when Im all in a rut
Im a Klusterfuk nigga yall are just
Growin up low enough musta sucked
Call me what call me a Klusterfuk
Growin up low enough musta sucked
Call me what call me a Klusterfuk
Talk about growin up fucked up I grew up with a mentally Ill mother so its no wonder that Im slightly askew
Her fanatical religious views had me sittin in pews 8 days a week and because of that me and God didnt speak for a while
Now I crack a smile when asked my religious preference
I utter a Tech N9ne reference replyin Im a KLUSTERFUK
I mixed up all the stuff religion that had to offer boiled it in my cauldron till the bullshit burned off it
All that was left was love I cant say I always rise above the trivial shit in my life cause I dont
Sometimes my ego wont allow me to walk away if you know what Im sayin
Ive done a lot of drugs shit Ive done a lot of thugs but in the end
As long as Im aligned with love I KNOW Im livin righteous
By a landslide my energy
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically
Love it when the fans buy my memories
By a landslide my energy
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically
Love it when the fans buy my memories
By a landslide my energy Growin up low enough musta sucked
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically Call me what call me a Klusterfuk
Love it when the fans buy my memories
By a landslide my energy Growin up low enough musta sucked
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically Call me what call me a Klusterfuk
Love it when the fans buy my memories
Tis is all so serious
The tears on my face
Nownownownow people cussing and bussing
They get nothing but in the ground when they blown out
Oh wow tell me how he got the stubborn he tough and
He was young with a grown mouth
Zoned out cause my mother is gone how
Simply would he send me with the alone route
Going out to the studio hitting the Don Julio
My duty go if Im moody yo get up and get the song out
My angel fades then came more rage
And even though Strange still pays something inside of me saying it aint yo days
My prediction lost in the gray
Im thinkin the holy spirit dont really wanna hear it
So people who givin me evil they all finna pay
Anybody really want it Im a get dirty when a demon is my opponent
Feeling froggy any moment know you will never be the owner because Im on it
Losing mama really did it demons really gonna get it
Im looking for the light Im asking you open and losing all of my inner good and the hope with it
Tis is all so serious Constantly seeking
The tears on my face
I dont wanna hear no punk say Weirdo
If you aint in my circle then youre not even near bro
Here go the fear though getting Makzilla and my killas in the villa to make a racket in your ear go
That is severe mode bodies Im not even with the jolly
My tears go downmyface yeah
But Im switching the gears yo
Got on the plane to Colorado I go to hit the Summer Jam then momma tomorrow
Thinking the Lord will give me time while Im in Vado
To say I love her before the Bible go hollow
My show was sorrow needed a little bit of mo time to borrow
Man steady talking to God so I dont get it
Thought I was special enough for God to be with it
By giving me another day with my mother but I missed it
But rocking with Denver said in her name Im a rip this
This aint no way to be hella jaded see but Im created
My mother left me but her death aint okay with me
Still Im praying for her spirit to stay with me
Tis is all so serious Still I am seeking
When you interview me I dont wanna talk about this
I dont denounce God in any way
I just feel my mothers suffering was too great for how much she worshipped
Where im at right now I aint got no tolerance for somethin stupid or hatred or envy
If you bringin any one of those How bout Leave me alone
They pray ill free fall any day Well I dont need yall anyway
Negativity give me nay ya finna hear me say
Just leave me right here with my hennysay my chicks an plenty pay
Your boy Tech done blown an still rep the home but now I just wanna be left alone
They wish death and my flesh and my chromosomes slept my songs they need a little bit less Patron
And they holler the weirdo when i walk in the spot
The zeros pissed cuz they ladies wanna swaller my hero
They live in squaller and fear though they daughter come here though she know I keep plenty Robert De Niro You punks will never get to see me let a tear go
Started hatin the second I busted a mere flow I just want you to get some gones not near no
Negative energy that is a remedy hey yo listen here bro

I wont look back anymore after this
Pitch black star bright yeah thats my life
A bit of fire and ice
Watch friends plot foes stock ends and pot holes
Cause when the tank hit the bank it just got closed
Dont be stank in the paint cause the yak froze
Wish I knew back when I was strugglin
If I plugged in and kept bustin
Id be buzzin thatd make me super rich
Never knew my sufferin over but
Cousin I keep it up and gushin
And tell all of my family aunts and uncles cousins to do the shit
Just gain power through all of the rain showers
No different remain sour cause someone elses lame hours
Wish I woulda known to tell em all to start they own business
Make long digits instead of havin a boss who talk at the wrong pitches
To fake friends cause its never enough
At hostile situations with folks I learned its better to bust
First and you still a nigga no matter how much ya stuffs worth
You love who love you do hug who does true
Connect the true blood to cause blue
So keep hopin the Lord does show up
Cause itll never be no peace on earth for all of us
Till this mug blow up
Locked up Im free still doing time
Im stuck on notes of some of mine
Incarcerated Sometimes I hate it
This is the sentence of my life
Ponderin these thoughts while sittin idle in this mezzanine
Feel my feelins boilin up Im simmerin on everything
Goin for the gold because its shimmerin but everything
That you encounter seems to be devoured need a better team
Every thought and every dream every plot and every scheme
Lurkin around the corner is a hater waiting like a fiend
And choice of drug is negative and they use it like a sedative
Success becomes the cause of this effect abuse the medicine
You thinkin you can let em in partake in buildin excellence
The serpents come in twos and they meticulous with they meddlin
The feathers flock together see the relationships we settle in
Got consequences so its best to let em go we blessed again
Disloyalty unfoiled trynna justify they pestilence
I dont understand why they so manic pessimists
I guess if I had to guess Id make an estimate I guess that they
Was just afraid so watch us levitate til Im at heavens gate
Mmm Life sentence for fallin out ya physical body
Illuminate my soul officially became godly
I be the one all of these demons runnin from
Dumped a gun lifted spirits niggas deem me the chosen one
Phony family in my crowd rappin gap and loud
Facin twelve in the pin none of them niggas made a sound
None of them niggas round
Now the fame close and the name boasts
Im posed to break bread Bitch taste toast
I should smoke them ungrateful bitches
They doin the most to see what make you choke
It actually leave ya throat missin
Im on a mission to revisit kin and
My prime been hidden trynna dine with women
Dipped and find this linen try and find a business
I love who love Gee fuck you if its fuck me
Thats just how it gotta be cause Im paper routin
Tame nuisance insane view and check on my lawn
Strange recruit me guess when the God speakin strange music
Instead of cry maybe Ill keep it inside
hey its time to get into some sin

Kansas City killers and you can bet that we criminal
The demon inside of me keep on telling me when to go
So Ima keep reppin the midwest choppers freakin flows
And bout to be up on top of this and truly be bustin
Begging for mercy you punk I aint givin you NOTHING
We be the best We aint talking about women we be talking about paper
Already made come and terrible
And the competition is the killa
With or with the buretta tight right under my sweater
And we hide it delopta be where my killas
But my dealers are betta
Like a blender leeroy like a guillotine
Chop yo hands out and throw me out the window
WHEN WE COME TO THE STREET WE DON POST ON THE BLOCK
For the killa Ima lift my middle finger up to the cop
So On the way to the studio we be makin another hot track
They be lovin the way we spit it
Boy they want our position but they aint never get it
In the hone of the pacific
We the definiton of a soldier
My opposition is the cultural
I spit like a tomic
Me and my killa are guerillas
Boy we tryin to battle cuz they want our position
But they aint never get it
We the number one competitors dealin
Working the way to the top and get the millin
In the hone of the city you can never cross us
You can try to read us
You can try to beat us
Try to get your speed up but it aint gon matter
Cause after were done bustin a nigga we don after
We takin after techa nina is the master
Whenever Im reppin the city in the cane
Holla your brain cuz Im a disaster
Dilemma get ready decibel comin atcha
Because Im a style master And Im impressionable now
Just so ya kno now
Cause the best with the flow
Whenever you wanna flex you can go
And I make yo man go
SHELL FLOW WITH MORE STRIFE
Cuz the energy is the bomb
I can tell that you fascinated by the way we rhyme
And we flow like with the mo like
Mo strike wit the fire
BABY I KNO U SAY IT OFF
Cuz so senemy enemys now
Irritate with the haters that be comin around so I kick it
Like a realla with the style
Im too set for a cure so and I dont need for a doctor to work
Late for makin yo nerves
Late cause he called ya
Hands down now I popped ya now
Lets take a trip to the back of your real gear
Strange the individual wit ill skill
Let me act like you get tough wit it
When you get out of the truck spittin off the crane
Killers gon be the one to leavin yo bodies
AND THE GAME IS DROP
Cause whenever Im bustin its like
The techa nina get up the flow cause we
You better Act right get right
Cause Im the baddest nigga hookin up with the fastest badass
Hit you with the lyrical lyrical miracle whip incredible knock the head like a several
Diggy diggy down diggy down watcha diggy down
Cook it clown and at the house hold it down diggy diggy diggy down
And if you look for the sound you can be found
With the nigga in the crowd are you really wit me
And when you hear it then nigga then zip it
These make you want to reposition and pivit
When we write it and spit it we makin somebody get it
And if they wont hear it then they wont get it STOP
Oh we can keep babblin on
Or rapplin off at the mouth while we travelin
And we speakin on on the speakin on the things we be doin comin in to pop my mouth
And where the hell were u
And I can stop with the drop
And they see me pop I would say was you
And I wont hesitate to chop you
And if you look at the better at the better to combust you got the Cali gun for fun
And if you throw me past the pack man you get it
They putting down the gun
CHOPPA yousa CHOPPA that techa ninaz a CHOOPA
We gon come and Knock your block off

What up Is this Tech N9ne
You are a fucking asshole
Dont ever come past me or Ill make your life fucking Hell
I dont care who the fuck you are
You are a piece of fucking SHIT
Like honestly I dont know whats going on
I am sorry for being freaking mean
So theres always something right
The first time you lowered me to your door outside or something
Like theres something fucked up about you
Im looking back and my feelings are so in the past about you
This is my reaction to what is your reality
Intro Big Krizz Kalico Tech N9ne
Drunk at the club and you all cant stop me
Out the roof scoop the group we be troopin large crowds
Used to be all of me but its all on the bitch now
They wanna get me stuck they commin into my world
Its too late I got my wife my bitch my girl
But she too jealous Nickaleas
With the liffa kickin it
We can never be inconspicuous my bitch
But she give me Felicia ol hickeys
But go get me in the wee hours to get me slow quickys
Roll with my homies she so shifty my wife
Said if you cheated it you will come back to hunt you
She said my filthy world
And thats my first verse
My wife my bitch my girl
Daddy told me that she wanna control the chick
She gotta go and blow her grip
Because its all unload on a bitch
But two had mo lip
And three I just cant cope with
My wife my bitch my girl
And its right aint it
Cant really touch durin the day but in the night tame it
Gettin busy on the weight benches my bitch
You might look up and get your chick sucked
Spontaneous I dont know what we gonna try next my wife
Go a ghetto booty like Naomi
Im gonna tell you like Jayo say
All my bitches havin fancy dreams
And all my bitches wear Applebottom jeans
My wife my bitch my girl
The others for fun flippin
You end up with funds missin
Come wicked your women become vicious and cruel
Dump checkin to some funds with some checks and you loose
Out of balance the playalistical values and lyin
I done challenged the way of Mystical powers and hinted
I can silence an egotistical chick in a fight
Im defiant with an evil twist my girl my bitch and my wife
Aint no bitch on this planet that is a match for me
They get sick and they stand it cause Ninna packs the three
If naturally to cause a catastrophe
Dont like me my bitch
Might knife me twice just to spite me my wife
If I break her heart my bitch
Itll rip her apart my girl
But Im the smarter you all my wife my bitch my girl
Hook 4XLyrics submitted by luke
Inside joke is outside now
Just another way me and my crew say No way
Or Its not okay when I got the bottles pay
And somebody you dont know that wanna swallow say
I dont got no grip but want a sip No K
Can I take yo blunt right to my lips No K
Broke ass always begging me thats No K
You dont understand then bitch no way
See you ballin gotta tell em No K
Lookin like a money bag smellin Dolce
Hungry lookin at you like the fella at Chipotle
All you gotta tell em when theyre hailin Go play
We flyin you tryin to get a check sit next to whos buyin
She wanna sex a vet never request a net and love Tech for Tech but you lyin
Hey and thats no K get away and the bitch best obey
Tryin to use sex to get yo way but the greed negated everything that ho say
And she play it out like exposé tryin to get quality time like Lets crochet
Got me thinkin of chinnin some underhanded women but I never hit a woman so Imma fetch Solé
And then you whine sayin Thats no k Heh Heh Heh
Sayin if you got to hand out stop ya damn mouth
Aint none of my fault you get low pay
So needy Ha Im on ace of spades and you
They wanna try and get whatever you got
Wanna wear the chain and watch Ima say No K
No K thats what I say when I dont really wanna
Say that its all right but its all right No no no
No K thats what I tell you when I aint just trynna
Talk to you all night
Nooohh Cant get my money
Nooohh And Im one hunnit
Nooohh So Ima tell you thats okay
She my bitch but I aint finna giv her her none of my pay
No way no how no what
Bitch I dont give a motherfuck
Its paper over pussy POP
Celebrity get everything for free
If you cant swim you gon drown
Throw a bitch up in the air and break her fore she hit the ground
No K No K No K No K
This aint broadway no play
From the track from the cage from the swim from the mud
Words hella hate no love
No suckers allowed in my cap and hell no you cant hit my weed you tramp
Wanna stand on the stage No K you cant
Ride on my bus No K you cant
Why you always got ya hand out All you do is pout like a woman
Grown man act like niggas owe you somethin
Habitual liar always lyin for nothin
Start a lot of shit and be the first one runnin
No K prolly showin hella niggas in the game
Like Jose AK AK47 to a nigga brain
Get him out the way
Raised in the middle of the land full of barbaque stands and the brothers throw hands
Every buddy gritten gettin grands Kansas city were the pretty women make you say DWAM
Kicks it like a donkey cause we famous
Wicked women want me cause I came up
This is were the homies trip and say what
Yo we from the show me get my money and we pay up
Got on my Five o Ones and my gritter posture
If she papered Im in her choppers
Lettin her know this ninna dinner cost her
And Im famous squash her so animal like someone better get her doctor
This boys born and raised in KC MIZZOU
But once in a while I hit the LK for ladies
Cause they straight be in KU
Then back to Kansas city were is gates all on they plate
We think about it and we crave it when we vacate
I represent the MO and all the way to K state
Call me Tech N9ne but teachers and students call me A Yates
Im hella fine like the food at Ollie Gates
Strawberry baked bean mixed plate
So everybody just bounce rock skate
Cant wait OG Ollie Gates
We be scoutin pretty young things yo we got are selves in
Like dun deal Im a popper Blouzin
Get her hot and ready listenin to Roger Troutmen
Teach babyz we used to listen to this at least 80
We kansas city steppin no question
Tech N9ne Lyrics are found on wwwsonglyricscom
We reppin 56 and 57 we know that if he jeffen then hes shady
KCKs gate got the chicken wing thisell bring
Traffic when the people kick in things

Niggas in Missou aint changed
Make ya have to let loose thangs
Have you ever seen a MAC11
New TEC9 with the extension
Mayday man down call the reverend
I put that on the bible boy count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy count your blessings
I felt like they tone said Im comin to get ya
Well thats when all of the heavy artillery come in the picture
And luckily cause of your past you can have someone assist ya
I was raised a cool brother but these motherfuckers went and summoned a nigga
I swore to never let a mans hand take me to my grave nigga
With my fortune Imma get to torchin like Orkin I spray nigga
I know they dyin to get it with the N9ne
Thats fine they wanna make a nigga do the woop
So Imma take the carbine and put it to ya mind
Its goin through you not around ya like a hula hoop
Put that on the bible if ya fuckin with Tech get the rifles
Totally trippin tryna take my title lift you right up in the sky with the Eiffel
If you psycho you can do this if he chooses to be foolish
The gun never loses never give you the deuces
Nigga this is SuWu biz ahh
Let me calm my nerves Imma simply put this on the word
If ya hella aggravated cause of a song ya heard from the Nina I smoke a nigga like my ganja herb
Im on the verge no life beyond the surge
When I bomb ya served what does one deserve
But a head stomppin now put ya teeth on the curb nigga
Aye fuck all that goin back and forth with a nigga
Got a problem what he really wanna do
If you know like I know then you know true
And niggas make songs but they really dont do
What they say got guns but they really wont shoot
He afraid Ill lay a nigga down right now
Face to the concrete nose to the ground
Do him in the streets fore his prayers hit the cloud
And the flash and a bang it is rarely allowed
But a whole body down and a hole in the ground
Dig one for the niggas who be holdin ya down
Better know I got rounds and they will go around its enough
Eat a bullet from the fourpound if ya tough
And then let the choppa spray ya down and get up
Ya pull that off Ill believe you aint soft
Otherwise nigga you just soft as all them other guys
Ill kill ya dead and I put that on my mother eyes
Dont listen to these niggas they just kick a bunch of lies
How they got a bunch of guns Shot em all a bunch of times
I really do believe Tech got a bunch of nines
Before they gave my nigga Meech a bunch of time
I really know my nigga Young had a bunch of pies
For the low all my niggas had it for the high
So you believe them niggas out there talking bout they BMF
They should be them niggas none of mine
I know Young got it bout what he rap bout
I really pulled Meek Millz out the trap house
Just like I seen Doe B with a OZ
Turn around two weeks had a whole ki
Just cause I said as a joke that the dope game dead
Like this God a nigga went and showed me
Guess what Im tryna say is nigga I dont know you
And futhermore pussy nigga I dont want to
Man we just killed a small village man
You know what Im sayin
This hiphop aha Love this shit
Just give me one good time
Nobody is looking at me anyway
Nobody is looking at me anyway
I know that I’m Hardcore
Know how to start wars
Know how to scar yours in a fist fight
Cause toughness is our floor
Warriors that bond more
But this one is far tore up on this night
Some people show it
Some people hide it
Do it whenever they get excited
I can’t even do it
When the wrongs on mind
I’m saying i been trying to do it for a long long time
i get jealous when i see people do it
And it’s like fluid
How can they swallow that
When I can’t even chew it
God seen it fit
To label me the consouller
bestowed upon a bro and forever be the shoulder
My mission is plain to see
I’m wishing the pain in me would just leave me be why can’t it be
Simple cause on the real
This one could die
So I’m asking god
Just give me one good cry
If I could cry maybe one good time i could wash away all my pain
And maybe free my mind
After my shows it’s a lonely road
Sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul
No body’s looking at me anyway
Just give me one good time
No body’s looking at me anyway
Why I got to be the one to cheer up
People till they clear up
When I sneeze I tear up
And then I go look in a mirror
So I can see how it looks
When I really wanna know how it feels
When I’m hella down I try to push
No matter how hard no water spills
My patients is soon to go
waiting for the balloon to blow
I’m thinking back to when i used to go to funerals
No matter how close we were
On the inside it ain’t wild
Others be losing it
I’m just wishing I could just break down
And I been to a lot of them
And there’s not a one
That went on and got it done
No moisture that even try even to come
And this ain’t no tough thing because I’ve had enough pain
Tears should be runnin like mustangs
Man it must rain
Been trying for years
But the crying been inside
N the ninas so serious there ain’t no lying in his eyes
Makes me so furious
When I look n im a genocide
Please let me break down with the pain i felt when Brian Dennis died
If I could cry maybe one good time i could wash away all my pain
And maybe free my mind
After my shows it’s a lonely road
Sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul
No body’s looking at me anyway
Just give me one good time
No body’s looking at me anyway
I look at actors crying
It’s as easy as fondue
But what do you do when extreme hurt is upon you
Real life ain’t no movie homie
And this ain’t Jon woe
But I almost lost it on the ending of Jon q
And I almost lost it when Jennifer Hudson blew
But I’m still waiting for that real emotion to come thru
But then maybe I could get a cry god
Been red for life for the first time ever
Give me the blues
Sometimes I turn on the news
Look at all these feuds
Then I try to make them ooze
no tear drops from your eyes
poetrys music oh my
almost make me tear up when thinkin about my children no lie
Maybe I’m black hearted
You thinking damn he shady
Saying man he crazy
For the way I abandon me lady
One day she can repay me
Yes that woman can betray me
Then ill probably cry if not than I do it if I win me a Grammy maybe
If I could cry maybe one good time I could wash away all my pain
And maybe free my mind
After my shows it’s a lonely road
Sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul
No body’s looking at me anyway
Just give me one good time
No body’s looking at me anywayLyrics submitted by Justice
If i ever go away
If i ever goif i ever go if i ever go
If i ever go away
I want everybody that loves me to be
Ridin Paseo not in the day though
Cherish the day but then roll out when the day go
Ridin away yo pain and sorrow
Live for today cause you might not see tomorrow
Ridin Paseo not in the day though
Cherish the day but then roll out when the day go
Ridin away yo pain and sorrow
Live for today cause you might not see tomorrow
Roses are red and violets are blue
And we all get purple rain when you put together the 2
True lets talk about this street i know
Meta meta yo is needed when its time for me to go
I spent my whole life on this KC street
The PASEO where the real stay and the fake sees heat
Gangstas lay low get the queso and everyday breathe deep
But when the day goes all the broads out cause the babys sleep
On Paseo i reminisce if they love me then give em this
Never know when to go cause this life is so hit and miss
Cry for me never just have a ball wit each other
Cause thats what i had thanks goes out to my father and mother
And i love you so mama
If i ever happen to go mama
I think theres something you should know mama
I stayed away cause i was tryin to become somethin
Give a house to that one woman
Lets take a journey startin at 85th wrote some of my latest hits
Off 85th came back from Cali then i stayed with Chris
Off 76th my first baby was conceived
Off 75th was with slow mo in conditions you wouldnt believe
74th and Paseo on the corner
Slept with the AK for my homie Scoob
Any body came through that door was a gonner
64th i ate balogna and kicked it with mac and sonya
In French Village i sold dope for my folks in a place with a crack aroma
63rd street is the land and in Bishop Hogan
Demandin yall just keep rollin
If i didnt use it i would spit the verse
This is how how you find me if demons happen to hit me first
Right on 58th i lived from 12 to 17 with basima kechramin marty hassan and hakim
57th and 56th i had a ball i learned some tricks i learned some schemes
From my homeboys yall know who i mean
RDVs 55th pauls liquor try and talk slick if you crazy
Results in getting stomped by doc and stubaby
Keep ridin paseo for me
If you ridin solo tonight
Just keep on thinkin marco polo for life when youre
On 47th is gates and sons where Tech N9ne eats
39th at the bootleg i used to find peace
But at the scottish right on lynnwood masons at times meet
I used to kick it on 27th and 28th trues lake
Carefulyou might find yourself off in that piece if you hate
19th was my familys church they tried to save me too late
Cause doin shows on 18th and vine that was my true fate
Mary Lou Williams was my aunt
9th where i was raised
Way minor way back in the day they used to fight no one was framed
But now on independence ave i hear my son donnie
Sayin that he hear gunshots every night on 5th and it scares his momma ronnie
End of the road 29 north to the bridge
If i go im leavin everything to my wife and my kids
Travis if i go whatever my half is you give her
And no funeral just throw my ashes in the Missouri RiverLove
Mmmmmm Uuuurr no I cant do it cant do it cant do it
My pain killers in my dresser
Right next to my rester
What insane brain would agree to this gesture
Too unjest less stress left with no extra
Yous a mess true depressed steps can infect ya
Im a product of some shit gone wrong
Even though I speak to many with a hit song tone
Even though Im famous and Im givin chicks long dong
Man I feel like a copper top just a sick stone drone
One flew over the cuckoos nest
And he cashed some buku checks
But he was not mentally stable the crew new tech
As a phenomenon but karma wanna noose dudes necks
Designer of death get to choose whos next
Is it real to you but if you got evil your kind to come and steal a few
Condemn souls cause of what the old pain killer do
Keep having these dreams of my taking my nine milli
Who can help me execute this desire to pop a pill or two
You cant give me medical attention to ease my pain
Sometimes I feel helpess and need something to relieve my brain
You may love your MD
But he has none in store for me
So when the raining bores on me
My dream for fillers pain killer
My pain comes from me being a fuck up
With strange music we really we lucked up
Cause being a lost soul got my bucks up
Even though my cerebral cortex and spirit needed a touch up
Everybody around me hurtin and shit
Well everybody on tv kickin it reject jerkin and shit
Ill be the one on stage and studios stressed out workin and spit
This shit to the people and I know that I gotta alot of evil lurkin in quick
Women want me want me
So they flaunt thee monkey
Even doin sex sometimes a heap of stress still wants to haunt me
When I grab the yalk she couldnt talk and it was no humpty dumpty
Even though im sick in the head we kick it like a donkey dont we
My apology to anyone labeled a victim
And Im losin my mind I just picked up the nine and I gripped em
And I put it off in that direction like I was the kiss one
I always think of the day when Im able to pull back and I click em
You cant give me medical attention to ease my pain
Sometimes I feel helpless and need something to relieve my brain
You may love your MD
But he has none in store for me
So when the raining bores on me
My dream for fillers pain killers
Any light inside my head is just to dead to see
Any kind of way out of this hole can I
Pull this darkness outta this soul
Lotta people really wanna know how its so
Cause a lot of motherfuckers have been down this globe
And Im one of them
You can see it on the television everybody trippin and its a ton of em
Straight feelin that pain go insane
Then bang and it aint no none of em
Many ways to end these days
When the darkness really wanna shun the sun
Ten million ways to die when you constantly cry and the gun is one
You cant give me medical attention to ease my pain
tired of getting my shit like this man Im done with this fucking music man
Sometimes I feel helpless and need something to relieve my brain
You may love your MD
But he has none in store for me
So when the raining bores on me
My dream for fillers pain killers Lyrics submitted by Tedi LaBelle
Man lives in a sun lit world of what he believes to be reality
But there is unseen by most an underworld that is just as real
But not as brightly lit a DARKSIDE
I can write a verse and take the sun away
Say good bye to light because its gone today
Aint no smiling happiness is done away
Watch me paint a pic thatll make you run away
I dont really give of fuck what you think of me I had it up to here yep
Follow me into another demention of insanitys right here step
I know your feelin it Im lovin you when Im kissin n fuckin you in a minute Im a veer left
An by the pluck of the jugular see the blood of my lover and then I finish when your near death
Im sorry but I mean it cause when I got the tool on bitch I got bulimic
Up in her like a gynecologist with a penis
And when they bled on me I was giddy and never squeamish
Bad as a demon I cannot get rid of her I really rely on the feelin of the sex an the red of a woman
Can I take a bite of your cerebellum I think itll really get me up if I could be suckin your seratonin
Id rather just die than inflict any pain on somebody who truly put trusted me
Better yet I just make her the suffer who taught me mocked me n fucked with me
Maybe get up in the club and shoot it up and makem panic at the disco backwardsFuck you if devils are what you worship
I can paint a dark picture
You dont want me to start with cha
Dont want me commin with the heart hit cha
Chew you up and if you really tart spit cha
After the brain I put the lemon moraine in
Blood of a dame is what I drain my fangs in
Takein the spirit and the body it came in
Away from the sun and forever you can remain in
I can write a verse and take the sun away
Say good bye to light because its gone today
Aint no smiling happiness is done away
Watch me paint a pic thatll make you run away
When Im all up on a pallet a pain with blood of my name in vain sun up in it
Imna break it down the walls n try to stop me from poppin my gun up in it
Skits onta me honor me for the time never given to the rhyme in another mind lookin like a
Behind the face be the beast of another mutha fucka that be heard the least
So many here me when I say they can that I remember everybody that layd me astray yo fuckem
Nobody but my closest know about my darkness and when they fall away yo fuckm
Im to sick that I never checked outa my mentalward working in sweden
Burin the bodies this song made my memory feedm ghost made me loud and Im proud I can see them
I dont even wanna talk about it but I do it for the demons and the devils alive
Hopin that the nonbelievers get a number two in the eye please try to die save me the time
When I make a move when Im commin through Im a stay devoted to rhyme x9
Devoted to mine hex sign ruda wicked Im a be forever dedine
Picture this my wrist silt pissed off Im hangin from a meat hook
Yo Im bangin on a meat hook its the twist this chapter ya miss the darker the venom of a
Im tellin everybody Im not doin so well Im feelin my noggin to you better watch ya self
Subnoise when Im bangin on a tech set best believe the dark times are here my lips eclipse
I can write a verse and take the sun away
Say good bye to light because its gone today
Aint no smiling happiness is done away
Watch me paint a pic thatll make you run away
If its blood thirst will you run from it
No need cause Im inside you
When the sun is spit
When you have an evil you cannot report
Im am the royal sunshine malicious pain and heartless
If ever you ever need an alibi rely on me I am
I can write a verse and take the sun away
Say good bye to light because its gone today
Aint no smiling happiness is done away
Watch me paint a pic thatll make you run away
DARKNESSLyrics submitted by Keanu John
Real killas move in silence
Quiet storm such a tyrant
If I choose shes a giant
When shes on no compliance
Cause her demon needs violence
Dont give her no love never wanna fold up
Then you better hold up cause she cray
Youre just a shady bitch on a daily on some crazy shit
Dont fuck around with a lady itll be a blaze where your mercedez sit
Eightysix the baby bit you dont wanna run into my radius
Maybe get you rabies sick and the gravy is Aint that about a bitch
When you date the girl and you make the girl
And she fuckin with another manll make you hurl
She methodical with a chain and gonna break ya world
Taste the world of a shotgun aught one in the head nigga not fun
But you really wanna pop some
can the even drop when he got done
Your imagination kills you when its so bad its aching
And whats your status hatin a whole lot of aggravation
Cause shes kickin it with this rapper and that rapper
And that factor get a gat clapper
Gotta mash after with a blast at her
Silly bitches dont consider your feelings
They make you think that the love is real when you chilling
But when you turn away she gets to illin with another nigga
Prolly drilling for real and you know his music and he knows yours too
Aint no limits to what your whore do
Pillow talking with her no more true
Lovin when I catch up with em bro youre through
Aye bro the bitch that you fuckin with man she was in the club last night with that rap Whats up with that

Freakin you make you repeat it like its a sequel

Cause your bitch might be a Psycho bitch
This bitch talking to me in this alley she love me to bits
But on the other end she really takin the dick
I never knew she was evil my nigga told me that he caught her with him in the mix
That is when I get to trippin and having a fit
He think he witty she told him we broke up uh
Taking the dick on my penis she choke up uh
He know Im tripping cause she fuckin telling him uh
He gonna feel it when I put the hell in him cha
Im outraged cause Ive been lied to
If I happen to catch her with him she can die too
Used to be my boo now shes sucking some guys goo
Wanna divide two and dump em both in the bayou
Steppin with my crew Im coming to fight you
Bullets gonna fly through whoevers walkin beside you

Sike nigga this her boyfriend and Im on my way now to fuck you up
Sup nigga talk that funny shit now nigga
Aw this hoass nigga right here
Yeah man I do believe you have to be careful with relationships
Men kill each other over women everyday
I lost my best friend Brian Dennis to a crime of passion
Why not have all these links to all these different genres
Why cant I be the epicenter of all types of music
I now pronounce me and music together from now until the end of time
Always on the road Doin hella shows
Day to day high and lows but thats just how it goes
When you grinding homie aint no rewinding
Time but the family behind in this business that Im in
I dont feel anything and its hard remembering
Places and faces they think Im what December brings
The day is just like moments turned to hours
Autographs sound check radio spots and quick showers
Hit the stage and get so much love from the fans
Keep it rough with the fellas but I make the ladies want to dance
And still I dont think you understand whats real
While Im with you with my wife another chance is killed
And my kids all three of em suffer in the worst ways
Cause last year I missed all three of they birthdays
So when you see me with me eyes full of pain
Give me love cause these are three of the reason why I call the road the rain
So here we are now In the rain
A superstar now In the rain
So far now In the rain
The Rain Im walking in rain
I live my life like In the rain
Just for the limelight Is it right or is it wrong
Daddy Whats up me and Reign really miss you
Not to mention momma always need a tissue
I saw your picture in the paper and I kissed you
I heard you wont be home for Halloween is this true
Yea Im used to it
Why dont you teach me and Reign how to produce music
So we can travel everywhere that youre traveling
And be in the family me and sissy fighting and tattling
I know you miss that I know you dig that
Do your fans every wonder about where your kids at
Is Donny really coming to move with us in LA
Will mommy still love you and be with you everyday
I gotta go now I love you daddy but slow down
Theres not enough Techa Ninas to go around
Rainbows crying she wants to talk to you badly
So here we are now In the rain
A superstar now In the rain
So far now In the rain
The Rain Im walking in rain
I live my life like In the rain
Just for the limelight Is it right or is it wrong
Cause they make it possible for me to provide for the Fam
The fact that my life is in shambles they could give a damn
When it shakes then they chose it fakes who hate lose it
They love my pain because it makes for great music
But in the interim this family matter is a tend to one of mine
Leave in January and come back when the winter come like
Calling my wife when Im in the rain and then end up getting into a dumb fight
Cause she lonely you try to console her but you aint come right
So its about what and what
You give them everything they need
But what they need is your presence indeed
Life yes has been a strainer
Its like if been a stranger
To my kids and wife
Thats the life of an entertainer
Swords deep in the game
The worlds peeping my pain
Out on the road cussing for sure reaching for fame
Healthy relationship you cant have them when youre living life in the rain

The industry are my foes they treat me like I got a red nose
They put me down and treat me like I got a red nose
Dont make me clown and have to go put on my red nose

That a black dude lookin like he got a white tattoo
People thinkin that he way tainted
By evil treat u like fecal wanna beef you when they meet you
People percieve you to be lethal
When you aint see through like tissue grunt
I feel like the industry gettin me with this stupidity
willing to distribute these fictious sissies when i rip
it so serious and wickedly no forgiving thee
when im claimin Strange everyone tellin me im
a sane Ward Bane im a independent talented
individual workin but the industry is the reindeer game
and they call me rudolph the red
they know im rippin the the mic when i chew off the head
spit it at the PDs DJs VDs TVs

if u tough me snuff me homie trust me nothin
its worse then knowing your beautiful
but your treated like an ugly duckling
so im Rocky Dennis but im so polished nothin can stop me in this
battlin the planet does not replenish
the fakes who immitate and mock me finish grunt
We checked the Mill yes its real
through Strange i dont need your major record deal
They tend to stray away from me because im different
And its been this way with me ever since i was an infant
All the kids were jealous they said the look off my eyes seemed hellish
Never knowin later in life i would rellish
the thought of me ballin livin my life and sell it grunt
I blame it on program directors go and request us
no damn selector but if u gotta lotta
dough man they bless ya shit can depress ya
when ya knowin that there aint no one betta mane
stuck off in the cold when the bad weather came
now they gotta see me livin it up through the cheddar gain
commin from a pain to another reign
so i throw up the finger to everbody who got a tow up demeanor
thinkin that tech nina was sho nuff a dreamer
but the flows so heavy it could show up Katrina
now its time to face and you all must face it
tech nina is sacred all you hatin faggots couldnt see me with lasik
Red nose the leader so follow
you gotta be ready to get up and go ii the motto
runnin through everything negative bravo
the monetythats commin to me feel like i won the lotto grunt
Now im about to put the sleigh on auto
swoop down on the DJ tell him to quit the replay
neva put tech nina in the Sarato
Its wierd people act a different way with me
I feel like nobody wanna play wit me
And thats ill cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes
the industry are my foes they treat me like i got a Red nose red nose
they put me down and treat me like i got a red nose
Im commin and drivin my short bus
with this nose i dont need a torcha
bustin through like the industries porsha
commin after who didnt support us
rip down its bleachers i blew up cause my sound is ether
underground ive been found this creature
not scared of a nigga with clownish features grunt
im makin a name outside your mainstream
real it wasnt an insane dream
from the beginning i really came clean
you about to see Strange gleam takin over in gangreen
Strange Muzic and RBC alone with Funterror
Now its not funny cause with the money i can fly away
Why do they do me wrong my musics truly strong
Because im different all you cowards wanna see me gone
This is the Strange year world wide fames near
But the games quire sometimes i feel like im rudolph the reindeer
And the music they said blows is on top of the Craig Grove
Yall gonna have to open the doo for the bro with the red nose
This song is dedicated to Bryon Bzl Dennis and all of the 57th street rogue dog villains
This one right heres for the riot makers the moshers the surfers and jaw breakers
We gon start this shit off right we got KCMO in the house tonight
We gon start this shit off right we got Tecca Nina in the house tonight
This is the moment for riders and thugs
Strippers and body bag zippers and violence and drugs
Poverty a bunch of minorities die in the club
They say my musics makin em lose it I write it in blood
This is my music for all my people missin my music
Keep listenin to it aint like I said get a pistol and use it
Satan shot my homie maintain with a missile and blew it
For the industry cuz he was one of the truest
I dont know why they be funkin its somethin
Maybe in the music when it be pumpin
Its crunk and its hella hateriffic hateriffic
Throw your set up in the air is all the dj really wanna play
When its over its lookin bloody and satanistic satanistic
Killas from everywhere listen to me when I be bussin shit
Im turbulent some get nervous when I wreck arenas wreck arenas
Concert promoters in Honolulu dont wanna see me
Cuz they said that Samoans will riot off Tecca Nina
Cause imma riot maker thats if you dont know
Imma riot maker they mosh at my show
Imma riot maker and I come out bussin
Imma riot maker riot maker I dont give a damn about nothin
Slide faker imma skyscraper riot maker
Hop in a mosh pit fa sho
You push you shove you get elbowed
Back on cuz this for fat tone and mac dre
All of the soldiers who got gone on that day
All my people sittin in prison
This is for you so wont you listen to the shit that Im spittin
Fuck the law man the government theyll hymn yo ass up
Theyll do everything in their power to get a fast buck
No right or wrong just killer bees out for your honeycomb
Bet you find out when you bond out you can be free if your money long
Ever been to one of my shows yeah it might be crazy
In Ohio a chick got a little too hyphy baby
Stage diving and crowd surfing couldnt hold back
But they dropped her now shes unconscious with her skull cracked
Now when this happened it wasnt even during my set
They wanted me to give a signed poster to the hospital bet
When travis told me we got papers I thought he was playin
This bitch is suin Tecca Nina for one hundred grand
Stand back if youre frightened
Yeah get back cuz we fightin
Thats why everybody in my past is trynna get a little piece of my paper
Man I swear the Nina will never love them plug them
When Im rollin with Skatterman and Snug Brim
Its skatterman cat strange musics black sheep why
Cuz Im still countin money off the back streets
Every city every show I gotta pack heat
This aint no fuckin rap song check my rap sheet
Im one of a kind turn one into nine
Blow your head off your shoulders dog its nothin but time
And I never raise my voice you a bum why should I holla on you
With a whisper I can drop a couple dollas on you
Sssick them rottweilers on you
Killas bustin out the windows of Impalas on ya
A made man in the streets I made grands
Wrote lyrics about my life dropped the album and made fans
Now Im chillin on tour with the redhead wonder
Did 57 shows in a three month summer
On the deuce next bitch ass nigga fuckin with tech
Gonna be found in swope park with his nuts in his neck

Snug brim kansas city missouri uzi groupie doobies fifths
You suzie qs aint no excuse for the sick so watch your tongue if youre whoopin
Ill get to shootin over you and your bitch
You just assume you tried the shoes and they fit
You never knew that I lose you off in the section with your dude in the ditch
Whether its rappin dog or movin them bricks I keep it gutter lil homey
Look my record see im doin it thick
As you can tell I aint no regular nigga im filled with star quality
Blow indo with bitches thats naked and watch your broad swallow me

Invest your stock boy kansas city hot boys

You can see me now or later mother fuckin riot maker
We will shut this muthafucka down
We will tear up your muthafuckin town
Since 1985 six six triple eight forty six ninety nine three
Send whatever you do in life to hell or heaven
Tech and x and krizz will make em call the reverend
I kill off everything wit this
So good you better be bringin it
Killin em cleverly kingin shit that is so real I will never be dreamin this
Killin em softly no it aint my lane
Hard is the way I display my pain
I put it on murder the moment they say my name
Those who are not real
Push pull kick aim squeeze drill
Push pull kick aim squeeze drill
You better be careful with summoning my circle with evil intentions I dominate
Lets see what youre made of
Kill everything youre afraid of

But my head was too big for her ass

I see shadows on the road again wonder if they comin for my soul
i get trapped up in this mode again and will i ever grow old
and will i ever grow old
I member them high nights
on ex we find sights
unheard to men we lined white
molly up and had a benign flight
mix it with weed and wet its Cronkite
that shits beyond height
sped us up and we be tripin seeing some shit
its fuckin up the buzz of me and the click
so we hop up in the whip and flee with the quick
but a shadow make us swerve and we on the strip
did you see the shit
yeah i saw the shit
did yall see the shit
yeah we saw the shit
all agree that a shadow was crossing the street then immediately vanished we need a hit
I see shadows on the road again wonder if they comin for my soul
i get trapped up in this mode again and will i ever grow old
and will i ever grow old
is it coming for me because of all the shit i did in the past
was bad to people
if your the AOD Im sad to meet you
angel of death when i quit doing ex
because of seeing you every night on the stretch
so Ive been clean for three
years and counting still Im seeing shadows will they shceme for me
to fallow them into the pit of dis pare
punishment for what i did in this lare
what if evil spirits live in the road
to take the kindle spirits brothers and souls
i dont know how the spirit thing goes
realer livin in my frontal lobe
will i be living life until Im old
or will i be takin by shadows on the road
I see shadows on the road again wonder if they comin for my soul
i get trapped up in this mode again and will i ever grow old
and will i ever grow oldLyrics submitted by Bobby
Verse 1 Tech N9ne
My momma my momma my momma is so tormented
She been through trauma more drama
The dawn is gone its more tinted
On this side it gets out of it
How does a prophet who loved God as his fathers slippin to get the bottomless side of it
How come an angel gotta be sick in the pancreas like she an athiest
Maybe its the faith that is makin this lady as crazy and has made me this skeptic
Next threat is Lupis on top of Epiliptic Never rested
Psychiatrist forever tested Reverend blessed it
Brethren Heaven Tech is beggin for effin XMas
Hopin momma aint left an exit
It better get better quick how you let her get sick with bread invested
In the church every sunday
Ive been searchin for one way
Or another youre gonna have to curse me or burst me with a sunray
To let me know that youre coming or en route
Im bout ninetynine but I need a hundred percent proof
Im kinda feelin that it is a facade
And if it is why aint He doin His job
Even if its a thing a man or a broad
Show me a God please
Let me know something is listening when Im down on my knees
Where was the Passion of Christ
What happened to passin his life for the masses
Bad it aint happenin twice
Cause my mothers stacked in a lab and its stagnant at nights
I need your help and Im not askin it nice
All in life its been paramedics
All my life comin up all I heard Is There A Medic
A youngin all I could do is stare at it
Seizure after seizure if I was you
Wouldnt neer let it be heredittary
If Aar get it I swear that its scary
Sittin in a insane asylum
God or Gods Ghost man I aim to find em
To take away all of this angels pain inside come rain
If Momma go how come I cant deny them
And she only fiftyfour in a ward watchin her war
And its more blood and gore and she tore cuz people are so deceivin
And Im on the floor because with nor Lord this war absorbs more poor
Havin all the soldiers screamin
Im kinda feelin that it is a facade
And if it is why aint He doin His job
Even if its a thing a man or a broad
Show me a God please
Let me know something is listening when Im down on my knees
Think about how all the victims of Katrina feelin
They need a ceilin they say that Mother Nature she the villain
Plead a million the bible I read a bllion Still Im free to see the real
And my feet are grillin cause hellish heat is buildin up
Think my momma aint ill enough Its killin us
I will erupt if theyre pillin her false still aint no healin her
I been searchin for answers but I find nothin but man stuff
That puts a damper on the current problem at hand bruh
Or whatever it is I will never forgive
Anybody who take Marty better get her to live
Shes so sick that it dont matter how much cheddar I give
To the thing or the lady heres a letter to his
Majesty why aint you stoppin these tragedies
My mothers glad to be with you but her lifes been a raggedy one
Whats gonna be done in two thousand twelve when hells gonna be
When the Earth aligned with the sun
Im kinda feelin that it is a facade
And if it is why aint He doin His job
Even if its a thing a man or a broad
Show me a God please
Let me know something is listening when Im down on my knees
Thats why I be lookin for ghosts
Or somethin supernatural The only thing I know Supernatural is the rapper
Maybe if I saw something like that itd make me change my life or somethin

I dont wanna be part of this
But I let it take me
So I let it take me
Now its dripping all over me
We on this Earth as we hell raisers
We crave good life but born into this deadzone
Ive searched for answers from my female maker
In the cemetery but they never produced her headstone
Black as ever like shabba
Thick and oozing like lava
See this room with my Prada dadda
Mustve came from my father
Cause my momma was an angel
But this thang grow insane bro
Over the years the heartless but fools I made it
Over to here on the TV
Cops kill a man cause hes trying to buy a BB Gun
Whats gonna happen when they see me come
Im bout to just boom
Let it explode and shake the masses
Shroud that I carry here to break the rabbits
Now my heart and brain together in unity
They say my metamorphosis made a monster
In so many ways this statement might be true
Your plan right from the start was divide and conquer
So what do you think I see when I see you
Im bout to show you Im vicious
Dont make me give the crooked coppers the business
Dont let me close to yall
If you touch it its like an overdose of Propofol
I be the ghost of all
That wanna vote for hogs
I need a germ to come through me
See the evil I grab
It stick to me like a magnet
Rack Im a clack on they asses
Give the evil no passes
Hey Now everybody sit down and shut the fuck up
Class is now in session
If you came here to hear that lovey dovey shit Get the fuck out
If you soft and scared of hardcore shit Get the fuck out
For those who love raw shit Welcome to Sickology 101
Your instructor for today is Tech N9ne
I use pitch to catch and seduce chicks
To signal the true sick
Mellow tone is what you spit
Bust up that quick Midwest chatter
And some people hate but it aint matterin
But the people gather its flattering
Theres no need to be stiff in this bitch
Spittin full clips on a mission for bliss
When I be ripping this shit Make it exciting
Gotta be inviting when youre writing your piece
If youre gonna be biting Youre igniting the beast
If you got it Mix it hot as tamales
You singing offkey is garbage
If you cant keep an octave in a pocket You need to stop it
Have confidence Speak with conviction
Dont put em asleep when you rock it
This is harmony N9nas taking you through it
Make it buttery Utterly beautiful Make it fluid
Sickology 101 is in session I thought you knew it
We murderin muthafuckaz in music

Get on your feet Up out your seat
Get on your feet Up out your seat
Get on your feet Up out your seat
Such an oddity with it This is sickology
Get on your feet Up out your seat
Get on your feet Up out your seat
Get on your feet Up out your seat
From our West Coast instructor Crooked I
They keep me crushing the competition
Coming correct when creating the crazy composition
Got a crooked coppa missing
Cali killers on candid cock emissions
That was constant cotenant wordplay
Wordplay rhymes with Thursday and thirsty If Im thurstay
I change the pronunciation of words per se
The English language gotta do whatever my verse say
So if you want to learn to rap This is how This is how
Right now Im putting swag in my style In my style
Its a emphasis on the simplest sentences
Then I give em charisma with a laugh and a smile And a smile
If you want your verses to cost higher
Then your similes gotta be hot as a live wire
You need some better metaphors
This song is a war zone and you listeners in the cross fire
Get on your feet Up out your seat
Get on your feet Up out your seat
Get on your feet Up out your seat
Such an oddity with it This is sickology
Get on your feet Up out your seat
Get on your feet Up out your seat
Get on your feet Up out your seat
From our East Coast instructor Chino XL
Everybody start locking your windows and doors
Its like lightning and hounds striking a trifling riflemen
Bullets flying up and Im numb in the bum Like its Vicodin
So much metal in his spine
He could get rich from the recycling
Dont get burned from the buzz
Like when the branch is heard from the judge
Bludgeon no love Industry hate me
Yo Id rather hear Hannah Montana
Than half of you rappers on the radio
Startin drama with Chino God forbid
Auction my lyrics on eBay Thats God for bid
Problem is lyric Jesus is more than a man with a sick delivery
Like I drive a coroner van
Im demented Spitting rhythms as sick as I can
Grenade gripping Fitting to detonate Disneyland
Try to follow how every punch line hits
Like Chris Browns fist in the face of Rihanna
Get on your feet Up out your seat
Get on your feet Up out your seat
Get on your feet Up out your seat
Such an oddity with it This is Sickology
Get on your feet Up out your seat
Get on your feet Up out your seat
Get on your feet Up out your seat
Yes I gotta be vicious This is Sickology
For those who dont know what the fucks goin on
Lets kill these niggazLyrics submitted by Jeremy
I get to busting like Im a thirtyaughtsix
When Im rippin the beat up but then I heard they got pissed
When I got at the top then made em pretty hot
Cause they knowin that Tecca Ninnas the dirty chop chopper
He’s handled Holmes here’s a handful
How in the hell he hoverin havin hell and go ham though
I said to Seven Richard Havensll be the man
So we put it together thinking Eminem was a gamble
Guess not cause he be the guest spot
Kaliko said what we doin I said to im lets chop
So now the people finally get three of the best locked
Never be another choppers comin so lets rock nigga
Youre on people got to wondering if its a for sure song
Yes I got another killer making a tour strong
If you thinking of battling youre gone
Nobody can catch up meet the Speedy Gonzalez
The beat is the problem
And if ya got your feet in your mouth
You gon have to beat it up out of him
Its a lot of em and I mean a lot of em
And me and Nina used to follow them
I’ve got to audibly body them
And this is it man the hitman the Ip Man karate em
And the fans will lift hands well be dancin out of em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of em
Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of em
If I aint makin sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It aint ever been a given I heat em I beat em I burn em
Then I let em out
They never heard of us but look at me Im turnin up
I slap the shirt off a stupid simpleton to make em be impotent
If and when Im flippin niggas be feminine
I said the purpose to pick a pen
And reverse the conditions Im livin in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast so I smash on a nigga
With half the cash Im a little sicker quicker than your figure
Ice cold I make em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half ass delivering Imma eat your dinner
Better than mine oh no not me I mean other guys
I jump around so do that mean that Im rubberized
Me and N9ne master meaning we murderize
We bleed ‘em beat em till they be gone feed em
If you wanna go with us
Imma leave em in the dust
I must be the one to bust
And Im gonna hit the clutch
Like Ill never slow down
Wait Before I wreck this beat let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills of ecstacy pills next to me
In the seats spilled or did she eat em all with a breakfast drink
In the habit of grabbin a mic and babblin I dabble in lights
But I might just swallow my fuckin Ritalin tablet after the night
Im grabbin it right from the medicine cabinet
Cause thats what its like and attack it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in my backpack when I write
This thing I penned up inside when I went up inside
A Finnegans diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured Id try to set a big enough fire
That’ll trigger the sprinkler system
And Id escape but the getaway driver screwed up my limo
Collided with the center divider
I went through the window and ended up bein
Pinned to the side of a semi
Offended beside a friend of the guy’s wife
Friend of the flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
‘Cause when I pick up a pen I’m venomous
And I’m as thick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist sinister
I invented this I’m the Genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy
Hell with a clitoris hit or miss you
Never consider this a bit of disappointment
Ill never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in thisll
Be just like a certificate of authenticity
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way for ‘em to picket it
I pick a day to be picked and I’m picking the wickedest shit to say
Spin it back on a level incredible head of a rebel unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away uhuh not today
Murder you on a song and then Ill just say
I was with Dr Dre and Robert Blake
Eatin lobster steak and coffee cake
At a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
Im a lot to take like Kanye
Walking up on the stage for Beyonce
Like it’s my job to say
That you’re not a real artist but it’s my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way you will not escape
With his gun at your hundred words
And a clip on that which motherfuckers better run
If youre not lookin to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one dont wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the
Im the fury the final fight
I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin fright
I flick it on fire finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall Im floggin a foe with a fife
Never forget it I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it you tripping to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who’s having to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal we giving the light a lot of energy
We repping beat checking he that be Koba
If hes the evil enemy itll be over
Wanna get down in front of your town
You ever making fun of the clown Im gunning you down
We doing it under the ground a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound dont wanna be found bitch
Would never be chopping without Slick Rick
I got it from the record lick the balls and this dick
If you never listen to me you musical misfit
Nah cause every time I be dropping I get bit
Im hearing a lot of rappers they trying to spit quick
But the Middle West got em and we killing em in this bitch
If you aint in my circle of choppers you missed it
Cause me and my nigga Twista ruler and thats it
