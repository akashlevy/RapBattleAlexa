Ay yo turn the bass up a lil bit G
Rakim Make em clap to this X2
I come again funll begin when the drummer come in Synonyms dont want to end Rakims gonna win
Always seem to come out at the right time with the right rhyme Smooth in the day and sound rough at night time
Just an echo in every ghetto meadow and valley sidestreet and alley from New York to Cali
Ive been seen in every state and between on stage They scream every phrase I leave the city in a rage
Its off to the next one to bless one thats my procedure Leave ya in a deeper mind state than anesthesia
Youll catch a seizure if you try to stop the great when I operate Just let The CrowdPleaser drop the weight
This one is in gear inform everyone from here to there Ideas that you hear severe to the ear
Never the less I provide a worldwide request and manifest
And this is from the East to the West
From New York to Cali to Cali X2
Coast to coast Ive been rippin coliseums and clubs
From New York to Cali to Cali
Rhymin over dubs for thugs
girls blow me kisses and throw me hugs
Musical rides Ive memorized in my mental enterprise Then improvise live with my supplies
You know the quota Fashion new designs and shine the international kind start to rhyme time to motor
UniverSoul format Adapt to wherever ya livin at From all four corners of the map
Whenever they play it it gets interpretated HipHop related Already dedicated to keep it heavy populate it
Attract everybody that could rock Do a block party make it look like Woodstock Yeah Rakim Allah
Nothins similar to my seminar they travel near from far plus thats where the woman are
I like to ask em Whats the best time to hear me rhyme
Never the less I provide a worldwide request and manifest
And this is from the East to the West
From New York to Cali to Cali X2
Coast to coast Ive been rippin coliseums and clubs
From New York to Cali to Cali
Rhymin over dubs for thugs
girls blow me kisses and throw me hugs
Coast to coast Ive been rippin coliseums and clubs
Rhymin over dubs for thugs girls blow me kisses and throw me hugs
An expert at a concert on stage I got classics which means my smash hits wont age
Ya sing along Ill bring a song Ill be swingin long we can do a thang till dawn I came to bring it on
On tour stop at all the record stores across the nation Flow at the radio station to show appreciation
Which reached for the streets beats for the Jeeps I reach incredible feats to get deep for my peeps
Propped for the unorthodox style I got they couldnt wait for me to drop new stock for the block
Stalk kids cassette decks Walkman headsets I come on fly concepts thats hightech
My first displays still converse with the days and slam thats why the mans first jam still plays
So tell the neighborhoods I got the goods again
Its Rakim Then again thats how it shouldve been
Never the less I provide a worldwide request and manifest
And this from the East to the West
From New York to Cali to Cali X3
Coast to coast Ive been rippin coliseums and clubs
From New York to Cali to Cali
Rhymin over dubs for thugs
girls blow me kisses and throw me hugsLyrics submitted by Edud Ciryl
