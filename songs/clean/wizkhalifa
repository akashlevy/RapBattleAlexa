Im known as the youngest in charge
My shit bang out the trunk of your car
Its the cities known rap spitta
Skin and bones but really known as that nigga
Im known to chase the bucks
Grind to get my paper up
In the studio writin rhymes till the paper crunch
Im not the type that you would call em a thug
But Im a huster its all in my blood
So if its all for the cheese then Im in it
My screws kinda loose so I ease to the finish
I hop up in the coupe feel the breeze while Im in it
Blowin smoke up out the roof from the trees that Im spliffin
Youngin got the game on lock
Im on top its a shame yall not
You a lame put your brain on pot
Leave you wet like the rain yall drop
Im gon rock and I aint gon stop
Whos the kid spittin flames
His name its Wiz Khalifa man
From the home of the greats
Where they known for the cake
The place that steel city damn
I got that Pittsburgh sound
And Imma always hold Pittsburgh down
You cant tell by now
Pittsburgh Imma swell my town
Roll rubber you dont know who you dealin with
Oh so innocent but flows so diligent
My spit games like a 44 killin shit
Know your man warm but the young ball killin shit
Realist shit and your main wife dig me
Game try and hit me
Kick game like 50 Cent
Niggas wanna play games I quickly
Mob with a squad that will bang out wit me
And they want the kid still hurtin
Yea thats what I call a steal curtain
I handle my time and still work it
Put in work couple mill worth in
And Im from Pittsburgh where the green
and the eatin is good
And the fiends do everything in the hood
Everyday is like a war so my soldiers ride fatigues in the hood
And we gettin all the green like we should
Whos the kid spittin flames
His name its Wiz Khalifa man

Where they known for the cake

Smoke ezwiders with hash fuck bitches from out of state
Valet bringing me cars waiter bringing me plates
Shrimp and fillet Mignon we celebrate buying drinks
Wit a couple of broads and my niggas who got love for me
Its lonely at the top Im tired of having company
Uh so while you busy trying to fit in Im a stand out
And view my life through this lens to see how it pans out
Substitute teacher ass niggas need a handout
Middle finger screaming fuck them niggas who hated
Pop another bottle that chronic smokin degraded
Speculating me landing must of got me mistaken

Of course the haters wanna do me bad prolly mad cause all the shit that i have
I never let em slow me down dawg Im livin fast

Im still a youngin but niggas respect the flow
But dont check me you better check you ho

And you chumps can amount out for them ones and Im bout
Done with you punks and you clowns wantin to come for the crown

I put the business on a nigga really thinkin that he feelin that he wanna come and test the flow
Cause Im not for the games all will you not do a thing
See I was taught you gotta walk if you talk and you say
And its 412 til I fall to the grave
They dont know what to do with the ball to this day
Cause Im always pimpin if my voice is on a track the whole world gon listen
Some niggas playa hate but you could say I get away with murder like OJ Simpson
Im into all day grinding though not to come easy Im puttin the time in

I had a dream that the whole World was staring at me
I woke up and wasnt no one there yeah eh eaah
Same song to a different beat
Cause sometimes I feels like Im the only one there
I guess nobody cares hey
But everythings good until it goes bad
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
It hurts when it dont last
No easy way saying bye
So Im a spread my wings and head for the sky
Im tired of being tired
And dealing with your BS
The money for your request
Without me youre a dime
But with me youre a buck fifty haha
I can get another one quickly
But Id rather wade it out
Take the broken pieces try and fix it
Or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision
And Ill be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit
But what you say to me aint guaranteed to always be the Gospel
I was doing good way before I met you
Now youre off the set
And Im a let you see the show go on without you
Take a bow think about it
And hopefully we could be friends but I really doubt it
See you be catching feelings now and I be catching planes
The story of my life youre just another page
But everythings good until it goes bad
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
It hurts when it dont last
No easy way saying bye
So Im a spread my wings and head for the sky
I had a dream that the whole World was staring at me staring at me
I woke up and wasnt no one there no one there

First 48 first 48
Took out 50 racks and blew the first 48

Soon as they see that Maserati they gone surely hate
Hundred for a show can you afford a date
And thats just one show imagine what my tour gon make
Police ran up on my tour bus
But hey my niggas more money more problems
More lawyers on the case
Niggas at the Grammys
I was at the crib working
Heard they little dis but Im just being the big person
Never been trained still my aim near perfect
Everything I spits murder bow
With black on black cars coming through
Presidential shit tints on the whip
So dark cant see who riding in that bitch
Suits and ties no questions why
Somebody get a box ready for these guys
No four door had the coupe that ride
That eagle right here if you wanna feel fly
No games though no names spoke
This crack right here cocaine flow
I dont know what you doing but Im paid bro
Yeah I pitch that 9 like pedro
Stuck in the car with my nigga Im ready to ride
We on our way to the top watch that paper rise
Keep telling everybody what you gonna do

And them gang gang boys wanna bore you

Plus Im struggling tryna find the keys to my car
Cause I be going hard roll the camera
Life just like a movie Im the star
Wish you was in my position
You too broke to play the part
Of course I keep some bad women with me in the back
Sippin Rose with some hash twistin
All about a dollar my team in the cash gettin
Straight out the burb we drinking we smash niggas
So when I say Im balling that dont mean that Im playing mate
All my diamonds talkin you can see what they sayin mayne
In the middle of the night early in the mornin
From the streets to the sheets with some freaks I aint yawnin
Im wide awake we aint eatin we aint sleepin
These bitches so high man we aint even speakin

Im bout to give it up like Ive been holding back all night
Girl take pride in what you want to do
Even if that means a new man every night inside of you
Baby I dont mind
You can tell by how I roll
Cause my clique hard and my cup cold
My talk slurred cause I’m so throwed
And Im wiping sweat from my last show
And hes TG and Im XO
Im only here for one night
Then Imma be a memory
Say it in my ear so I can hear what youre saying to me
I got cups full of that Rose
Smoke anything thats passed to me
Dont worry bout my voice
I wont need it for what Im about to do to you
Bad bitch girl I think I might get used to you

All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

Drop the top in that 69
And that motor roar in that old Chevelle
Can’t say a thing how you supposed to feel
Stacking all of this paper dawg
I like to call this shit old news
It means haters jocking our old moves
Popping champagne cause we made it
Back of the Phantom we faded
All of this shit that I did I probably wont remember tomorrowLyrics submitted by Aliya Smith
Nigga I smoke good everyday
I probably live the life that you wish you could everyday
You probably think I had it good had it made
But nigg Im from the burg I was in the hood everyday
But now Im hopping offa Jets
These people cutting me checks
And I say people cause Im rich
And rich people show me respect Show me respect
This come from Atrium hes from Collette
These diamonds I got on they are baguettes
On DBS so all of em see me used to be just be that dude on the net
Now Im all on your TV butler and ask what I wanna get Bentley or Lamborghini
Just came home and made 200 grand blew it all in Waikiki
Just came home and made 200 grand blew it all on Luigi
Smoking on 8 ounces told myself aint often that sleepy
Realest nigga out it aint hard to believe me
Thats why all the people that you know try their hardest to be me
Cause nigga I smoke good everyday
I probably live the life that you wish you could everyday
You probably think I had it good got it made
But nigg Im from the burg now roll up the herb

Wiz Khalifa Verse 1
Its your anniversary isnt it
And your man aint acting right
So you packin your Domiar luggage up callin my cell phone tryin ta catch a flight
You know one thing straight Ill be there girl whenever you call me
When you at home thats your man soon as you land you say its all me
But shit aint all G with him no more you aint entertained
Since I meet you a couple months ago you aint been the same
Not sayin Im the richest man alive but Im in the game
As long as you keep it 100 Imma spend this change
Whenever you need me
You know you can call me Ill be there shortly
Dont care what your friends say cause they dont know me
I can be your best friend and you be my homie
I aint gonna flex Im not gonna front
You know if I ball then we all gonna stunt
Send her my way she aint gotta hold up
Whenever you call baby Ill roll up Ill roll up Ill roll up
Whenever you call baby Ill roll up Ill roll up Ill roll up
Whenever you call baby Ill roll up
Wiz Khalifa Verse 2
I try to stay out your business
But on the real youre so obvious
And if you keep fitting me in your plans and fuckin up your mans gonna catch onto us
That white sand surrounding us
He be handcuffing he should work for them officers
If you rolling I got a spot where I can put you on this medical and send you home doctored up
You wanna ride with me cause you say that he boring
Wake up you rollin weed cooking eggs in the morning
Aint scared to spend this money I know Ill make more of it
First you was in the sky now you say you in orbit
No matter where I am
No matter where you are
Ill be there when its over baby
Cause I was there from the start
No matter if Im near
Dont matter if your far
All you do is pick the phone up lady
And Ill be there when you call
Whenever you need me
You know you can call me Ill be there shortly
Dont care what your friends say cause they dont know me
I can be your best friend and you be my homie
I aint gonna flex Im not gonna front
You know if I ball then we all gonna stunt
Send her my way she aint gotta hold up
Whenever you call baby Ill roll up
Whenever you need me
You know you can call me Ill be there shortly
Dont care what your friends say cause they dont know me
I can be your best friend and you be my homie
I aint gonna flex Im not gonna front
You know if I ball then we all gonna stunt
Send her my way she aint gotta hold up
Whenever you call baby Ill roll up Ill roll up Ill roll up
Whenever you call baby Ill roll up Ill roll up Ill roll up
Whenever you call baby Ill roll up

Wiz Khalifa verse 1
And they say they ballin’ but I do it how the pros do
Where we goin next we gon let my hoes choose
No socks and my boat shoes
Guess a ngga eating good like whole foods
Not a couple cameras now they bring the whole crew
Bad bitch ride wit me so she pose too
See me and my guys like a plane flown through
Hella high roll up weed up like I’m supposed too
And now I’m into big things
On the building you need to know the tenant rate
Gettin paid still ridin no shirt
Let a btch give me brain call it home work
Nggas try hatin’ on ‘em but it dont work
New clothes new car new things
Sayin boy they used to be at the bottom
Came up thats what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the roof top
Used to not be allowedd in the building
But now we on the roof top
Slow money just better than gettin’ no money
Learn to get good show money that’s yo money
Get comfortable with it really know money
Rich ngga shit that really goes for me
Self made ngga well played
I’m on the plane drinkin’ champagne and lemonade
You tryna copy whats done I’m tryna innovate
And club owners getting tired of tryna ventilate
I’m too busy finding places and trips to take
The more I smoke the more money my business make
Remember they used to be like “who is this”
Now I’m up in this bitch they light up like independance day
When you around the real you keep it real everyday
My nggas keep it real so I hear what they say
Either you getting paid or you paying to play
Either you on your grind or you stay out the way
New clothes new car new things
Sayin boy they used to be at the bottom
Came up thats what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the roof top
Used to not be allowedd in the building
But now we on the roof top
Slow money just better than gettin’ no money
Uhh just made a million got another million on my schedule
The pick up on my Ferrari you jets or you jetless
You nggas aint help us on second thoughts you did
They hatin was the fuel for this shit so you wrote your own check off a hoe ass
Sweatin bullets at home wondering if she coming back
and she she can smell it on ya
Thats why you only see her when you buying stuff for her
We was sneaking in then it was general admission
Now we own the arena deciding who allowed in it
Our windows aint tinted pimpin I aint trippin’
Had showered that shit I’m just ballin’ and chillin
We plooted this out one night in the city
Now we Los Angeles medicine cabinet twisting
Our habits are expensive we gotta have it
Twitpic’ing when we get it and they mad at us
New clothes new car new things
Sayin boy they used to be at the bottom
Came up thats what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the roof top
Used to not be allowedd in the building
But now we on the roof top
Slow money just better than gettin’ no money
Alotta money lotta luggage lotta hoes
When you putting in work thats how it goes
Alotta money lotta luggage lotta hoes
When you putting in work thats how it goes
Alotta money lotta luggage lotta hoes
When you putting in work thats how it goes
Alotta money lotta luggage lotta hoes
When you putting in work thats how it goes
And if the kids tryna be like me they probably smoking bout an O
Oh aint my fault though
It is what it is man
What it was what it wasn’t
Blow it by the O’
Blow a lot of paper I got rich when I was young
Now the folks say that I’m famous
If you smoke this you’ll get high
Wonder what your name is
All I do is keep it G my nigga that my second nature
I’m in New York with the thugs
London eatin’ Nando smokin’ weed like I’m Jamaican
Monday all through Sunday all this money I be makin’
Never been a pussy dog and never did no hatin’
Always been the realest on my section of debatin’
Rollin’ tree I got some kush in California waitin’
Breakfast on a plane breakfast on a plane
Don’t gotta eat when I land
I had breakfast on a plane
Diamonds in my time my nig
My necklace is the same
Live the way I live you get respect just for your change
Come through where I live you might get checked just for your change
This industry is a bitch my dog it’s best to use your brain
Keep a couple niggas ‘round that’s tryna do the same
And make a couple million for you try to make a name
Keep a couple niggas ‘round that’s tryna do the same
And make a couple million for you try to make a name

Its been a long day without you my friend
And Ill tell you all about it when I see you again
Weve come a long way from where we began
Oh Ill tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn who knew all the planes we flew
Good things weve been through
That Ill be standing right here
Talking to you about another path I
Know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldnt last
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days hard work forever pays now I see you in a better place
How could we not talk about family when familys all that we got
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride
First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong and whats
Small turn to a friendship a friendship
Turn into a bond and that bond will never
Be broke and the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first then the line
Will never be crossed established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn and that line is what
We reach so remember me when Im gone
So let the light guide your way hold every memory
As you go and every road you take will always lead you home

Aye you probably think you know where this is goin’
But this ain’t one of them kinda songs
Somebody roll and let’s get it on
While I forget it all and get zoned
And I remember back in the day
Before I thought about gettin’ paid
The ladies ain’t wan’ give me no play
The haters aint have nothin’ to say
They never let me into the club
The radio ain’t show me no love
Gave my all but it just wasn’t enough
And complaining too it’s just how it was
And now I’m just posted
With my baddest bitch and we just kick it in this villa watchin’ pictures gettin roasted
Vision gettin’ clearer yea she open
But her eyes low never under the clouds baby we floatin’
Aye you probably think you know where this is goin
but this ain’t one of them kinda songs
somebody roll and let’s get it on
While I forget it all and get zoned
I started coming up in the game
And people started knowin’ my name
They tried to put me into that lane
And we had to go our separate ways
Instead of fussin’ and flippin’ out
I did my thing and figured it out
Security trippin I ain’t puttin it out
And all my peoples got champagne fast cars by the bar wasted
Potent marijuana that aroma make her wanna taste it
Horses in my car little Louis on my bracelet
When you live just like a star it feels so amazing
Aye you probably think you know where this is goin
but this ain’t one of them kinda songs
somebody roll and let’s get it on
While I forget it all and get zoned
Uh high but I’m focused one thing they know is
If you rollin wit tha gang then you rollin up another plane
Ok no stems no seeds I keep it G
If you rollin’ wit’ tha gang then you rollin up another plane 2x
And them lame niggas get dissed I let that bad bitch twist
If you rollin up tha gang then you rollin wit another plane 3xLyrics submitted by wallstreet jr

Its Wiz Khalifa man
This shit hot right
Now dont blink cause the flow is closer dont think
True diplomat no Jim Jones and no Pink
And the city wanna know what except that I claim
Blackout be the gang its attached to my veins
And I dont got a problem giving naps to Elaine
Order every syllable every rap to my name ye
The grim reaper came back with a cane
Thats me spittin crack to your brain
Niggers they cant stand me ladies they demand me
Damn your mans handy
And Im the mayor when I blam with them hands
Have you seeing stars like you walk with them Grammies
Your reign was short Im running it now
Knock your teeth out for biting now you be gunning my style
I keep it honey Im selling them Im the blackout
Put my sneakers to your face youll be running your mouth
Its too late nigga

Man its too late
Yall niggas aint early enough
Its my time nigga
And some say Im contradictory
Cause I flow nice and spit I mean trying to get green
Play it how I split teams
Youll be sixteen storming nigga sixteen
Six two feeling glock with a sick lean
Big dreams only two words get green
Which means never had no job
I spit to keep it simple the truth like no lies
No god I know why
I make it clear theres no reason for your life
And I make it ahead see me speeding and blow by
You dudes fake I see through you with closed eyes
And wont stop till they can get rich
And make pay from the rap I spit
It aint hard to tell like a snitch that Im next on deck
And care less about who making the pay
Listen its too late
Its too late nigga
Its too late man
Yall dudes fake pray for me
Its my time nigga
You catch rabies if you bite this hair
Safe to say I dont like to share ye
You see Im what the ladies want so they like to stare
Im a beast I eat tracks and bite the snare
See I got blind eyes and they like the glare
Dudes hate cause I rock shit they like to wear
And Ill battle anybody who can fight the fan
Spit crack put the pipe in their ears
And my boys have the nigga broke down in a second
Shots split a clown into sections
Round your protection Im back at it like a crack addict
The fact I spit crack dog Im assbackwards
I lay it down bring a clown to his knees
See we be a truce in D ye
And niggas faking like they kicking cause they moving them keys
But if I shoot you I be doing a deed nigga
Its too late nigga
Its too late man
Yall niggas aint early enough
Its my turn niggaLyrics submitted by Cierra
Damn we back in business
Uh wakin up the neighbors you could hear the headboard shakin
Ill leave all of your body parts achin
Speedin up the pace while I look right into your face
You tell me thats that good shit youre tastin
And I know you like it from the side
But tonight Imma just unwind and let you ride and watch you take it
Cause Im tryin to get you so wet I mean so wet
If theres a record for this shit then Imma break it
Its goin down no matter the place or time I call
Think anything you think you want no prob I got enough cake
All up in it in the mornin knowin damn well that I had you up late
Aint buyin it you aint spendin it you keep throwin it back so Im givin it
You love when I get up in it
You love when I get you love when I get x4
Wake up when I bake up thats just somethin that I do
Pick your favorite sex scene thats what Im gon do to you
Up in your beds where you probably belong
Givin you all that I got til its gone
Sexy as fuck you still got them heels on
Favorite position we tryin them all
Once I get in cant get out of my zone
Fuck you so good you wont pick up your phone
And when your girlfriends or whoever do call
You fuckin with me so you tell em you gone
You dont smoke so I break it down you roll it up
You poke it out your face down so I hold it up
You dont give a shit that my money so big I cant fold it up
Plus I aint tired til you finish this aint a race but Im winnin
You dont even gotta name a place where we can go
Cause we already goin goin goin
Dont nobody gotta ask or even got to know
Baby we already goin goin goin

Work hard play hard x4
Diamonds all on my brain nigga
Gold watches gold chain nigga
Hundred thou’ on champagne nigga
Yeah my money insane nigga
Yeah I’m making it rain nigga
When I was just on a plane nigga
Fuck what you heard its my time of year
If I’m in the club I get a hundred stacks
I’m always rollin’ up so I could laugh at that
Them other niggas stole my swag but I don’t want it back
My nigga uh I was on this but I’m onto that
You see it in the closet before it’s on the rack
Was at the Hawaii now I’m going back
I got so much money I should start a bank
So much paper right in front of me it’s hard to think
Find so many bottles it’s gon be hard to drink
But I’m still pouring up and my family here
And they rolling up so ugh
That’s why where I come from the only thing we know is
Work hard play hard x4
Hopped your pretty ass up in this fucking car
Bitch I’m out this world girl you know I’m a star
Used to buying rounds but now we buy the bar
Last year they had to ask now they know who we are
‘Bout shit walk in the building I own shit
You can tell by who I’m on the phone with
Damn nigga talkin’ bout grown shit
Nigga too busy jackin’ my swag
Need to fuck around get ya own shit
Get ya own cars get ya own clothes
Get ya own smoke get ya own bitch
Yeah you ain’t reppin’ my gang get ya own clique
That’s why where I come from the only thing we know is
Go hard make sure you do whatever it is that you gotta do
And niggas gonna hate but that’s no prob’
So hey fuck ‘em don’t need nothing from ‘em
Some niggas talking but the shit they claiming don’t mean nothing
That’s whats in my joint
OG and been one since I was young enough that know that everybody was gonna know me
That’s why where I come from the only thing we know is
Work hard play hard x4

I got all these J’s rolled up
And got all these drinks poured up
I bought all these bottles up in this club
Came here with all of my dogs
But I’m tryna leave with you and your friends
Yeah tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends ball
I got all these J’s rolled up
And got all these drinks poured up
I bought all these bottles up in this club
Came here with all of my dogs
But I’m tryna leave with you and your friends
Yeah tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends ball
You and your friends up in my car
Rolling up J’s flying with the stars
Don’t gotta ask the price ‘cause you already know
Watch full of ice no light it still glow
With you and your friends me and my dogs
Left your nigga to be with my squad
He talk a lot of shit but he ain’t really on
He hit it too soft but me I go hard like
Oohy baby when you with me you go crazy
I want you to be my lady
Girl you could bring your girlfriends I ain’t hating
I got all these J’s rolled up
And got all these drinks poured up
I bought all these bottles up in this club
Came here with all of my dogs
But I’m tryna leave with you and your friends
Yeah tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends ball
I’m parked outside in a Range Rover
Coke white so tight game over
Coupe to the block bop to the bang
Car full of girls in a blue Mustang
Four y’all more y’all caravan
VIP model in hand bottle in hand
I make it crack in the back a Benz while cracking the frame
On the highway just me and Wiz
With a dirt dozen about to handle this
Was they cousins or was they twins
I love it when they both go all in
Like that this one and that one
See he wants the cute one I want the fat one
Bet she pay what she weigh
I’m looking for a Jennifer Holiday in my way
I got all these J’s rolled up
And got all these drinks poured up
I bought all these bottles up in this club
Came here with all of my dogs
But I’m tryna leave with you and your friends
Yeah tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends ball
I got all these J’s rolled up
And got all these drinks poured up
I bought all these bottles up in this club
Came here with all of my dogs
But I’m tryna leave with you and your friends
Yeah tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends ball
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out
That’s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
So what I keep ‘em rolled up
Saggin’ my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
And look clean dont it
Washed it the other day watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And smoke them hoes down ’til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I’m with your bitch smokin’ grade A
It’s like I’m 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god I’m on the chase Chevy
Its gettin’ kinda heavy relevant sellin’ it
Dippin’ away time keeps slippin’ away
Zip in the safe flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Up front four blunts like “Khalifa put the weed in a J”
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out
That’s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
And I dont even care
Cause if me and my team in there
Theres gonna be some weed in the air
Blowin everywhere we goin and now you knowin
When I step right up get my lighter so I can light up
Thats how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin youre down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin up
From the ground up pound up this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Now Im chillin fresh outta class feelin
Like Im on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car no job no children
Had a science project me and Mac killed it
THC MAC DEV HD3 high as me
This is us we gon fuss
And we gon fight and we gon roll
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out
That’s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Yea roll one smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one smoke one and we all just having fun
So we just roll one smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one smoke one and we all just having fun
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out
That’s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and freeLyrics submitted by denniz ramirez
