The air begins to feel a little thin
As I start the car and then I begin
To add the miles piled up behind me
I barely feel a smile deep inside me
And I begin to envy the headlights driving south
I want to crack the door so I can just fall out
But then I remember when you packed my car
You reached in the back and bucked up your heart
For me to drive away with
The demons sat there waiting on her porch
It was a little dark so we held a makeshift torch
And when my car was far out of sight
He crept in her room and stayed there for the night
And then I felt chills in my bones
The breath I saw was not my own
I knew my skin that wrapped my frame
Wasnt made to play this game
And then I saw Him torch in hand
He laid it out what he had planned
And then I said Ill take the grave
Please just send them all my way
The air begins to feel a little thin
As were waiting for the morning to begin
But for now you told me to hold this jar
And when I looked inside I saw
For me to walk away with

Hello we havent talked in quite some time
I know I havent been the best
Ive been traveling in the deserts of my mind
And I havent found a drop of life
I havent found a drop of you
I havent found a drop
I havent found a drop of water
I try desperately to run through the sand
As I hold the water in the palm of my hand
Cause its all that I have and its all the I need
And the waves of the water mean nothing to me
But I tried my best and all the I can
To hold tightly onto whats left in my hand
But no matter how how tightly I will strain
The sand will slow me down and the water will drain
In fact Im only at it again
As an addict with a pen
Whos addicted to the wind
As it blows me back and forth
Of course Ill be here again
See you tomorrow but its the end of today
End of my ways as a walking denial
My trial was filed as a crazy suicidal head case
But you specialize in dying
You hear me screaming Father
And Im lying here just crying
So wash me with your water
Hello we havent talked in quite sometime

I dont fall slow like I used to
Youve stolen my air catcher
That kept me safe and sound
My parachutes will guide me
But now the cords not working
And I see you staring me down
I will try to avoid
I think you would beat
The moon in a pretty contest
And the moon just happened to be
The very first thing that I missed
I was doing fine on my own
And there wasnt much I lacked
But youve stolen my air catcher
And I dont know if I want it back
I will try to avoid
I want to give you
And I just dont say
What you want to hear
So Ill write my fears
In talking just to breathe
I will try to avoid
As tools that can destroy
Open the slits in your face and start your day
You dont have much time to make your slits look just right
Im singing lada lada lada lada lada lada da
Look in the mirror and ask your soul if youre alright
Put out the glitter that your soul hides behind
Im singing lada lada lada lada lada lada da
Open up your eyes and see
The clouds above will hold you
The clouds above will sing
Youre singing lada lada lada lada lada lada da
I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They will with fire exhale desire I know its dire
I have these thoughts so often I ought to replace the slot with what I once bought
Cause somebody stole my care radio
And now I just sit in silence
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that Im driving
Theres no hiding for me
Im forced to deal with what I feel
Theres no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel
I have these thoughts so often I ought to replace the slot with what I once bought
Cause somebody stole my care radio
And now I just sit in silence
Cause this time theres no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And its that were all battling fear
Oh dear I dont know if we know why were here
I liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose
Theres faith and theres sleep
We need to pick one please
Cause faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think
I have these thoughts so often I ought to replace the slot with what I once bought
Cause somebody stole my care radio
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in Silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They will with fire exhale desire I know its dire

Scared of my own image
Scared of my own immaturity
Scared of my own ceiling
Scared Ill die of uncertainty
Fear might be the death of me
Dont know whats inside of me
Even when I doubt you
Im no good without you no no
Im not sure if I can
Shaking hands with the dark parts of my thoughts no
You are all that Ive got no
Even when I doubt you
Im no good without you no no no no no
Claw away at this system
Want the mark hes made on my skin
To mean something to me again
Hope you havent left without me
Hope you havent left without me please
Even when I doubt you
Im no good without you no
Even when I doubt you
Im no good without you no no no no

I’m fairly local I’ve been around
I’ve seen the streets youre walking down
I’m fairly local good people now
I’m evil to the core
What I shouldnt do I will
What I want to save I’ll kill
Is that who I truly am
I truly don’t have a chance
Tomorrow I’ll keep a beat
Yo this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It’s the few the proud and the emotional
Yo you bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burning but we’re so cold
It’s the few the proud and the emotional
I’m not evil to the core
What I shouldnt do I will fight
What I want to save I will try
I know who I truly am
I truly do have a chance
Tomorrow I’ll switch the beat
I want to drive away
In the night headlights call my name
I Ill never be be what you see inside
You say Im not alone but I am petrified
You say that you are close is close the closest star
You just feel twice as far you just feel twice as far
And Ill fake you out
Of what you have to say
Cause I am quiet now
And silence gives you space
Ill never be be what you see inside
You say Im not alone but I am petrified
You say that you are close is close the closest star
You just feel twice as far you just feel twice as far
And Ill fake you out
It’s the same game today as it always is I dont give these places fake my name explaining this and the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines that remind me of all the times
I have committed dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly formfitted to what I’ve done and what I’m doing I’m brewing and losing and spewing infusing and believe me that’s what all the kids are doing
What kids are doing are killing themselves they feel they have no control of their prisoner’s cell and if you’re one of them then you’re one of me and you would do almost anything just to feel free
Am I right Of course I am convince me otherwise would take all night Before you walk away there’s one more thing I want to say
OUR BRAINS ARE SICK BUT thats OKAY
Ill fake you out
Yeah And Ill fall down
And Ill fake you out
Of what you have to say
Cause I am quiet now
And silence gives you spaceLyrics submitted by Gabby
I dont wanna fall fall away

I disguise and I will lie and i will take my precious time
As the days spent away as i stand in line
and i dye as i wait as i wait on my crime
and ill try to delay what you make of my life but i dont want your way i want mine
im dying and im trying but believe me im fine
but im lying im so very far from fine and
I I can feel the pull begin
Feel my conscience wearing thin
And my skin it will start
to break up and fall apart
I dont wanna fall fall away
I dont wanna fall fall away
Ill keep the lights on in this place
cause i dont wanna fall away
Every time i feel selfish ambition has taken my vision
my crime is my sentence repentance has take comission
its taking a toll on my soul im screaming submision and
i dont know if i am dying or living
cause i will save face for names sake abuse grace
take aim to obtain a new name and a newer face
but my name is lame i cant walk and i aint the same
and my name i became a new destiny to the grave and
I I can feel the pull begin
Feel my conscience wearing thin
And my skin it will start
to break up and fall apart

But when did you believe you were alone
You say that spiders crawled inside
And made themselves a home
Petrified of who you are
And who you have become
You will hide from everyone
Friend please remove your hands
From over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave
Dont take your life away from me
You walk by everyone you know
You say that youre fine
But you have lost your sway and glow
So I stopped by to let you know
Friend please remove your hands
From over your eyes for me
I know you want to leave
Dont take your life away from me
Would let me know your pain tonight
Cause I just wont let go
Till we both see the light
And I have nothing else I have to say
But I will listen to you all day

I know you want to leave but

We all are stranger creatures than when we all started out as kids
We have romantic fantasies about what dying truly is
To fall off the grid
I know theres someone at the door
They called for help of this Im sure
But do I want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes
Im holding on to what I know
And what I know I must let go
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along
For the eyes to sing alonglonglong
We all know somebody who knows somebody whos doing great
I know some people who know people who are flying straight
But Ill kindly enter in to rooms of depression
While ceiling fans and idle hands will take my life again
We live for the nights decor
It reveals what we dream of
I know theres someone at the door
They called for help of this Im sure
But do I want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes
Im holding on to what I know
And what I know I must let go
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along
This room is far too dark for us to stay around
Redemptions not that far and darkness is going down
This room is far too dark for us to stay around
Redemptions not that far and darkness is going down
Im holding on to what I know
And what I know I must let go
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along

I know what you think in the morning
When the sun shines on the ground
And shows what you have done
It shows where your mind has gone
And you swear to your parents
That it will never happen again
I know I know what that means
That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it dont take it

Im trying Im trying to sleep
But I cant but I cant when you all have
Im trying Im trying to sleep
Im trying Im trying to sleep
But I cant but I cant when you all have
Lets take this one second at a time
Lets take this one song this one rhyme
But theres hope out the window
So thats where well go
Lets go outside and all join hands
But until then youll never understand
That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it dont take it
Im trying Im trying to sleep
Im trying Im trying to sleep
But I cant but I cant when you all have
Weve turned our hands to guns trade in our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you of my disorder or my condition
Cause when the sun sets it upsets whats left of my invested interest
Interested in putting my fingers to my head
The solution is I see a whole room of these mutant kids
Fused at the wrist I simply tell them they should shoot at this
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music its
Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist

There’s an infestation in my mind’s imagination
I hope they choke on smoke cause I’m smoking them out the basement
This is not rap this is not hiphop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rapping to prove nothing just writing to say something
Cause I wasn’t the only one who wasn’t rushing to say nothing
This doesn’t mean I lost my dream
It’s just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean
Can you save my heavy dirty soul
Can you save my heavy dirty soul
For me for me oh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul
For me for me oh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul
No I didn’t understand the thing you said
If I didn’t know better I guess you’re all already dead
Mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch
Saying stuff like you only live once
You got one time to figure it out
One time to twist and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now
Sing with me if you know what I’m talking about
Can you save my heavy dirty soul
Can you save my heavy dirty soul
For me for me oh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul
For me for me oh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit
Can you save my heavy dirty soul

Im taking over my body back in control no more shotty
I bet a lot of me was lost ts uncrossed and is undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got
Not anymore flesh out the door swat
I mustve forgot you cant trust me
Im open a moment and close when you show it
Before you know it Im lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it
You should take my life you should take my soul
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my leftside brain
You are surrounding all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes
And Ill be holding on to you
Remember the moment you know exactly where youre going
Cause the next moment before you know it
Time is slowing and its frozen still
And the window sill looks really nice right
You think twice about your life it probably happens at night
right Fight it take the pain ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind loose enough to breathe fine and tie it
To a tree tell it You belong to me
This aint a noose this is a leash
And I have some news for you you must obey me
Lean with it rock with it
When we gunna stop with it

A shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I wont let them win go quietly
I wont let them win go quietly
Be the one be the one
To take my soul and make it undone
Be the one be the one
To take me home and show me the sun
You can bring the fire I can bring the bones
You make the fire in my bones and make it grow
Where were from theres no sun
Our hometowns in the dark
Where were from were no one
Our hometowns in the dark
Our hometowns in the dark
A shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I wont let them win go quietly
I wont let them win go quietly
All the gods your father served today
Your traditions believe me when I say
We dont know we dont know
How to put back the power in our soul
We dont know we dont know
Where to find what once was in our bones
Where were from theres no sun
Our hometowns in the dark
Where were from were no one
Our hometowns in the dark
Our hometowns in the dark
A shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I wont let them win go quietly
I wont let them win go quietly
Where were from theres no sun
Our hometowns in the dark
Where were from were no one
Our hometowns in the dark
Our hometowns in the dark
She asked me Son when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me
She asked me Son when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me
I will make you queen of everything you see
Ill put you on the map
Ill cure you of disease
Lets say we up and left this town
And turned our future upside down
Well make pretend that you and me
She asked me Son when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me
I will make you queen of everything you see
Ill put you on the map
Ill cure you of disease
And since we know that dreams are dead
And life turns plans up on their head
I will plan to be a bum
So I just might become someone
She asked me Son when I grow old
Will you buy me a house of gold
And when your father turns to stone
Will you take care of me
I will make you queen of everything you see
Ill put you on the map
Ill cure you of disease
I know youre not a liar
And I know you could set fire
Go ahead and make me look away
I am calling your lightening
Down from your dark hiding place
Go ahead and show me
I am simply very perplexed
Why wont you let us
Now is the climax to the story
That gives the demons and angels purpose
They fly around while we are walking
And mold our emotions just to please them
I am cold can you hear
I will fly with no hope no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing plummet as I sing
All we are is an isle of flightless birds
We find our worth in giving birth and stuff
Were lining our homes against winding roads
And we think the going is tough
We pick songs to sing remind us of things that nobody cares about
And honestly were probably more suicidal than ever now
If you decide to live by what you thinks wrong and whats right
Believe me youll begin to wish you were sleeping
Your weeping will creep in your head and youll cry
But if we wake up every morning and decide what we believe
We can take a part our very heart and the light will set us free
I am cold can you hear
I will fly with no hope no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing plummet as I
I am cold can you hear
I will fly with no hope no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing plummet as I sing
How frustrating and so degrading
As time will fly by and the sky will cry as light is fading
And he is waiting oh so patiently
While we repeat the same routine as we will please comfortability
Please dont think about why you cant sleep in the evening
And please dont be afraid of what your soul is really thinking
Your soul knows good and evil your soul knows both sides
And its time you pick your battle and I promise you this is mine
He stays home from work this time
He never really told his wife
He never really told a lie
But this time he decides that its alright
No one really knows his mind
And no one knows behind his eyes
The man deserves a medal
But hes never really won a prize before
He goes to lock the door
And oh he knows it
The world looks down and frowns
Get up cause the world has left you lying on the ground
Youre my pride and joy
Youre my pride and joy
Cause we all need you now
We all need you now
Someone said Where you going
Someone said to you Goodbye
When they say that they blame it on the times
They blame it on the time
We all know youre qualified to fix a chair and love your wife
They all know youre qualified
But they lie when they blame it on the times
Oh we blame it on the times
And oh he knows it
The world looks down and frowns
Get up cause the world as left you lying on the ground
Youre my pride and joy
Youre my pride and joy
Cause we all need you now
We all need you now
I will carry all your names
And I will carry all your shame 3x
Get up cause the world has left you lying on the ground
Youre my pride and joy
Youre my pride and joy
Cause we all need you now 2xLyrics submitted by Katie
Nobody thinks what I think
Nobody dreams when they blink
Think things are on the brink of blasphemy
Think things are after me
At my kitchen sink
You dont know what that means
Because a kitchen sink to you
Is not the same to me
Are you searching for purpose
Yeah it might be worthless
And it might be wordless
Youll see purpose start to surface
No one else is dealing with your demons
Meaning maybe defeating them
Could be the beginning of your meaning
Leave me alone
Nobody think what you think
No one empathy might be on the brink
Of extinction They will
Play a game and say they know
Exactly what youre going through
And I tried to come up with an artistic way
To say they dont know you
And neither do I
So heres an example of a stand up guy
Who hates what he believes
And loves it at the same time
Heres my brother and his heads
Screwed up but thats alright
The moment when Im living in em
Im winning a momentary sinning a
Moment passing after a rebeginning
Pretending enemies are friends of me
Sending me straight to bending me
My bad behavior but I bet I could have
Copy and paste caught me and copy
Better rhymes bother me
The better the rhythm the badder I am
But I bet Ill battle with em battle
Better I am gambling man
Better bet I am a gambling man
They say stay in your lane boy lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway highway
But will they be alive tomorrow
They think this thing is a highway
If it was our way
Wed have a tempo change every other time change
Cause our minds change on what we think is good
I wasnt raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasnt for this music I dont know how I wouldve fought this
Regardless all these songs Im hearing are so heartless
Dont trust a perfect person and dont trust a song thats flawless
Honest theres a few songs on this record that feel common
Im in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin
In the industry it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity is on the free when Im playin shows
They say stay in your lane boy lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway highway
But will they be alive tomorrow Will they be alive tomorrow
Im sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a hazmat
Hes my brother he likes when I rap fast
But lets back track back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list
But the problem is theres another list that exist and no one really think about this
Forget sanity forget salary forget vanity my morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
Youre gonna feel the heat of my calvary
All these songs Im hearing are so heartless
Dont trust a perfect person and dont trust a song thats flawless
They say stay in your lane boy lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway highway
But will they be alive tomorrow
They say stay in your lane boy lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway highway
But will they be alive tomorrow
Will they be alive tomorrow
Will they be alive tomorrow
They say stay in your lane boy lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway highway
But will they be alive tomorrow
They say stay in your lane boy lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway highway
But will they be alive tomorrow
You say things with your mouth
Cobwebs and flies come out
I hear a second voice behind your tongue somehow
Luckily I can read your mind
They will not take you down
They will not cast you out
Dear friend here we are again pretending
To understand how you think your world is ending
Sending signals and red flags in waves
Its hard to tell the difference between blood and water these days
Ill pray that one day you see
The only difference between life and dying
Is one is trying thats all were called to do
So try to love me and Ill try to save you
Ill take you on a ride
I will make you believe you are lovely
Your redemption wont grow stale
We are now just setting sail
On the seas of what we fear
Treason now is growing near to me
God hit me straight on

Theres miles of land in front of us
And were dying with every step we take
Were dying with every breath we make
And Ill fall in line
The strangers back is all I see
Hes only a few feet in front of me
And Ill look left and right sometimes
But Ill fall in line
No one looks up anymore
Cause you might get a rain drop in your eye
And heaven forbid they see you cry
As we fall in line
And about this time of every year
The line will go to the ocean pier
And walk right off into the sea
And then we fall asleep
And as we near the end of land
And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand
I ask myself the question Why I fall in line
Then out of the corner of my eye
I see a spaceship in the sky and hear a voice inside my head
Then the wages of war will start
Inside my head with my counterparts
And the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase
This lines the only way
And then I start down the sand
My eyes are focused on the end of land
But again the voice inside my head says
I dont wanna march here anymore
I realize that this line is dead
So Ill follow you instead
So then you put me back in my place
So I might start another day
And once again I will be
In a march to the seaLyrics submitted by Katie

People they rhyme like this were all impressed by this
They rip it flip it but these are just triplets

Its just poetry divided Im the kind of guy
Who takes every moment he knows he can fight it
And music to use it for others to use it
Youre dead cause how could you sleep at a time like this
Life is up here but you comment below
When the comments will always become common
Motivation to promote you choose next episode
So your brain knows to keep going even though hope
Is far from this moment but you would not know it
Gets better when morning finally rears its head
Together well lose this remember the future
Remember that morning is when night is dead

I’ve got a migraine and my pain will range from up down and sideways
Thank God it’s Friday ‘cause Fridays will always
Be better than Sundays ‘cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don’t know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms clouds snow and a slight drizzle
Whether it’s the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents
It’s me defending in suspense it’s me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examinant that’s represented best by my depressing
Thoughts I do not have writer’s block my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep I guess I’ll sleep when I’m dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat
Shadows will scream that I’m alone
But I know we’ve made it this far kid
I am not as fine as I seem pardon
Me for yelling I’m telling you green gardens
Are not what’s growing in my psyche it’s a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees
Freeze frame please let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won’t forget it’s all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That make Pandora’s Box’s contents look nonviolent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind’s shipwrecked this is the only land my mind could
Find I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves suicidal crazed lions
They’re trying to eat me blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
‘Cause sometimes to stay alive you got to kill your mind
And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain or brain has made
The game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that
Life has a hopeful undertoneLyrics submitted by Chase Williams
I just feel Im better off staying in the same room I was born in
I look outside and see a whole world
Better off without me in it trying to transform it
You are out of my mind oh
You arent seeing my side oh
You waste all of this time trying to get to me
But you are out of my mind
This ones a contradiction because of how happy it sounds
But the lyrics are so down
Because it represents wait better yet it is
Who I feel I am right now
You are out of my mind oh
You arent seeing my side oh
You waste all of this time trying to get to me
But you are out of my mind
Heard you say not today
Tore the curtains down windows open now make a sound
Heard your voice theres no choice
Tore the curtains down windows open now make a noise
Dont you test me no
Just because I play the piano
Doesnt mean I Im not willing to take you down
I Im out of my mind oh
Im not seeing things right oh
I waste all this time trying to run from you
But I Im out of my mind
Heard you say not today
Tore the curtains down windows open now make a sound
Heard your voice theres no choice
Tore the curtains down windows open now make a noise
You are out of my mind oh
You arent seeing my side oh
You waste all of this time trying to get to me
But you are out of my mind
Heard you say not today
Tore the curtains down windows open now make a sound
Heard your voice theres no choice
Tore the curtains down windows open now make a noise
Buh buh bah buh buh bah

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I wake up fine and dandy
But then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start
I go up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving
Like an old mans hair receding
Im pleading Please oh please
On my knees repeatedly asking
Why its got to be like this
I dont wanna be the one
To have the suns blood on my hands
Take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen I see harpoon
Cause the darks not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning
I dont hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out
I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone
They told me I was gone
Why wont you let me go
Do I threaten all your plans
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
On the eve of a day thats forgotten and fake
As the trees they await and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we dont need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes cause were told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling Theres something we need
Im not free I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied I threetime MVPd this crime
Im afraid to tell you who I adore
Wont tell you who Im singing towards
Metaphorically Im a whore and thats denial number four
Cause the darks not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning
I dont hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out
I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
they told me I was gone
They told me I was gone
Why wont you let me go
Do I threaten all your plans
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
Im sorryLyrics submitted by anna rogers
Your twisted mind is like snow on the road
Your shaking shoulders prove that its colder
Inside your head in the winter of death
I will tell you I love you
But the muffs on your will cater your fears
My nose and feet are running as we start
We will walk so much slower
Your twisted thoughts are like snow on the rooftops
As we travel through snow
We will walk so much slowerLyrics submitted by Katie

I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know its hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the suns piece of mind
I know its hard sometimes
Yeah I think about the end just way too much
But its fun to fantasize
All my enemies who wouldnt wish who I was
But its fun to fantasize
Oh oh Im falling so Im taking my time on my ride
Oh Im falling so Im taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride
Id die for you thats easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I dont seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
But literally I dont know what Id do
Id live for you and thats hard to do
Even harder to say when you know its not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There are people back home which are talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions theyre forming like
Who would you live for
Who would you die for
And would you ever kill
Oh oh Im falling so Im taking my time on my ride
Oh Im falling so Im taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

I cant take them on my own my own
Oh Im not the one you know you know
I have killed a man and all I know
Is I am on the run and go
Dont wanna call you in the nighttime
Dont wanna give you all my pieces
Dont wanna hand you all my trouble
Dont wanna give you all my demons
Youll have to watch me struggle
But tonight Ill need you to stay
I am up against the wall the wall
For I hear them coming down the hall
I have killed a man and all I know
Is I am on the run and go
Dont wanna call you in the nighttime
Dont wanna give you all my pieces
Dont wanna hand you all my trouble
Dont wanna give you all my demons
Youll have to watch me struggle
But tonight Ill need you to stay
Cold nights under siege from accusations
Cerebral thunder in oneway conversations
Dont wanna call you in the nighttime
Dont wanna give you all my pieces
Dont wanna hand you all my trouble
Dont wanna give you all my demons
Youll have to watch me struggle
But tonight Ill need you to stay
Tonight Ill need you to stay
I do not know why I would go
In front of you and hide my soul
Cause youre the only one who knows it
Yeah youre the only one who knows it
And I will hide behind my pride
Dont know why I think I can lie
Cause theres a screen on my chest
Yeah theres a screen on my chest
Im standing in front of you
Im standing in front of you
Im trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool
I cant see past my own nose Im seeing everything in slomo
Look out below crashing down to the ground just like a vertical locomotive
Thats a train am I painting the picture thats in my brain
A train from the sky locomotive my motives are insane
My flows not great okay I conversate with people
Who know if I flow on a song Ill get no radio play
While youre doing fine theres some people and I
Who have a really tough time getting through this life
So excuse us while we sing to the sky
Im standing in front of you
Im standing in front of you
Im trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool
Im standing in front of you
Im standing in front of you
Im trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool
The earth turns from sanity
Taking my Only friend I know
Leaves a lie His name is Hope
I’m never what I like
And I just can’t hide
When I make you cry
Cause I’m twisted up I’m twisted up inside
The horrors of the night melt away
Under the warm glow of survival of the day
Then we move on
My shadow grows taller with my fears
And my friends shrink small as night grows near
When the sun is coming window soothes
And the silver lining rides the hills
I will be saved for one whole day
Until the sun make the hills its grave
I’m never what I like
And I just can’t hide
When I make you cry
Cause I’m twisted up I’m twisted up inside
I’m never what I like
And I just can’t hide
When I make you cry
Cause I’m twisted up I’m twisted up inside my mind
But I’ll live on yeah I’ll live on yeah I’ll live on
By the time the night wears off the dust is down
I will rise and stand my ground
Waiting for the nights return
I’m never what I like
And I just can’t hide
When I make you cry
Cause I’m twisted up I’m twisted up inside
I’m never what I like
And I just can’t hide
When I make you cry
Cause I’m twisted up I’m twisted up inside my mindLyrics submitted by Gabby
I wish I found some better sounds no ones ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didnt have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now Im insecure and I care what people think
My names Blurryface and I care what you think
My names Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now were stressed out
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come Im never able to identify where its coming from
Id make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it never sell out of it Id probably only sell one
Itd be to my brother cause we have the same nose same clothes home grown the stones throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree house homes we all would take the latter
Used to play pretend give each other different names we would build a rocket ship and then wed fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now theyre laughing at our face singing wake up you need to make money yeah
We used to play pretend used to play pretend funny
We used to play pretend wake up you need the money
Used to play pretend used to play pretend bunny
We used to play pretend wake up you need the money
Used to play pretend give each other different names we would build a rocket ship and then wed fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now theyre laughing at our face saying wake up you need to make money yeah
I wanna fall inside your ghost
And fill up every hole inside my mind
And I want everyone to know
That I am half a soul divided
Sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away
Either way youre by my side until my dying days
And if Im not there and Im far away
I said Dont be afraid
I said Dont be afraid Were going home
I wanna strip myself of breath
A breathless piece of death Ive made for you
A mortal writing piece of song will help me carry on
Sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away
Either way youre by my side until my dying days
And if Im not there and Im far away
I said Dont be afraid
I said Dont be afraid Were going home
So the hearse ran out of gas
A passenger person grabbed a map
And the driver inside it contrived a new route to save the past
And checked his watch and grabbed a cab
A beautifully plain taxi cab
A cab had it cleared out back and two men started to unpack
But now this time there were three men
And then I heard one of them say
I know the night will turn to gray
I know the stars will start to fade
When all the darkness fades away
We had to steal him from his fate
So he could see another day
Then I cracked open my box
Someone must have picked the lock
A little light revealed the spot
Where my fingernails had fought
Then I pushed it open more
Pushing up against the door
Then I sat up off the floor
And found the breath I was searching for
Then there were three men up front
All I saw were backs of heads
And then I asked them Am I alive and well or am I dreaming dead
And then one turned around to say
Were driving toward the morning sun
Where all your blood is washed away
And all you did will be undone
I said Dont be afraid
Sometimes you gotta bleed to know
That you’re alive and have a soul
But it takes someone to come around
She’s the tear in my heart
She’s the tear in my heart
She’s the tear in my heart
The songs on the radio are okay
But my taste in music is your face
And it takes a song to come around
Shes the tear in my heart
She’s the tear in my heart
She’s the tear in my heart
You fell asleep in my car I drove the whole time
But that’s okay I’ll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I’m driving here I sit
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement
You fell asleep in my car I drove the whole time
But that’s okay I’ll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I’m driving here I sit
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement
Sometimes you gotta bleed to know oh oh
That you’re alive and have a soul oh oh
But it takes someone to come around
She’s the tear in my heart
She’s the tear in my heart
She’s the tear in my heart
My heart is my armor
She’s the tear in my heart
She’s a butcher with a smile
My heart is my armor
She’s the tear in my heart
She’s a butcher with a smile
I’m fairly local I’ve been around
I’ve seen the streets youre walking down
I’m fairly local good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I’m evil to the core
What I shouldnt do I will
They say I’m emotional
What I wanna save I’ll kill
Is that who I truly am
I truly don’t have a chance
Tomorrow I’ll keep a beat
And repeat yesterday’s dance
Yo this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It’s the few the proud and the emotional
Yo you bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burning but we’re so cold
It’s the few the proud and the emotional
I’m fairly local I’ve been around
I’ve seen the streets youre walking down
I’m fairly local good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I’m not evil to the core
What I shouldnt do I will fight
I know I’m emotional
What I wanna save I will try
I know who I truly am
I truly do have a chance
Tomorrow I’ll switch the beat
To avoid yesterday’s dance
Yo this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It’s the few the proud and the emotional
Yo you bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burning but we’re so cold
It’s the few the proud and the emotional
I’m fairly local I’ve been around
I’ve seen the streets youre walking down
I’m fairly local good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I’m fairly local I’ve been around
I’ve seen the streets youre walking down
I’m fairly local good people now
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Im fairly local good people now

You should never trust the pantaloon
And build yourself a home
That your dad is now a pantaloon
And all your friends fertilize
Hes seen too many stare downs
Between the sun and the moon
How he used to hustle all the people
Hes been around so long
Hes changed his meaning of a chair now
Is like a tiny island in the sea of all the people
Who glide across the very surface
That made his bones feeble
The end cant come soon enough
But is it too soon
Either way he cant deny
And all your friends fertilize
You like to sleep alone
Its colder than you know
Cause your skin is so
Its warmer in the morning
Than what it is at night
Your bones are held together
By your nightmare and your frights
And all your friends fertilize
I cant take them on my own my own
Oh Im not the one you know you know
I have killed a man and all I know
Is I am on the run and go
Dont wanna call you in the nighttime
Dont wanna give you all my pieces
Dont wanna hand you all my trouble
Dont wanna give you all my demons
Youll have to watch me struggle

He wakes up early today
Throws on a mask that will alter his face
Nobody knows his real name
But now he just uses one he saw on a grave
He pretends that hes okay
Him in bed late at night hes petrified
Take me out and finish this waste of a life
Everyone gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
As you watch him fall through a bleeding trapdoor
He thinks that faith might be dead
Nothing kills a man faster than his own head
He used to see dreams at night
But now hes just watching the backs of his eyes
He pretends that hes okay
Him in bed late at night hes petrified
Take me out and finish this waste of a life
Everyone gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
As you watch him fall through a bleeding trapdoor
Take me out and finish this waste of a life
Everyone gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
When you watch him fall through a bleeding trapdoor
Cause nobody knows hes alive
I know where you stand
And thats where I am
Where I happen to be
I can feel your breath
I can feel my death
I want to know you
I want to say hello Lyrics submitted by Josh Alvarez
Now the night is coming to an end
The sun will rise and we will try again
Stay alive stay alive for me
You will die but now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure to die
I will fear the night again
I hope Im not my only friend
Stay alive stay alive for me
You will die but now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure to die Lyrics submitted by Josh Alvarez
We dont believe whats on TV
Because its what we want to see
And what we want we know we cant believe
We have all learned to kill our dreams
That when I fail youll still be here
Cause if you stick around Ill sing you pretty sounds
And well make money selling your hair
I dont care whats in your hair
I just wanna know whats on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before Im old
But because of you I might think twice
What if my dream does not happen
Would I just change what Ive told my friends
Dont want to know who I would be
When I wake up from a dreamers sleep
That when I fail youll still be here
Cause if you stick around Ill sing you pretty sounds
And well make money selling your hair
I dont care whats in your hair
I just wanna know whats on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before Im old
But because of you I might think twice
I dont care whats in your hair
I just wanna know whats on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before Im old
But because of you I might think twice
