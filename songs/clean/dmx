Like the wind like the wind
God will take god will take
All my sins all of my sins
Blown away will be blown away
From 80 school street to way across town
Cats knew how I got down cause word got around
I was that robbery kid with no gun and no mask
Catch a nigga out the door slippin thats yo ass
Didnt laugh much cause I didnt have much
Life was like a stick half gas half clutch
Meaning half good and half bad
What was good if I caught a good vic if I didnt I was bad
Took it out on my regulars
I come through and if niggaz was broke I took watches and sneakers
Went to jail a few times but that didnt stop me
All it taught me was how not to be sloppy
An older cat robbed me when I was like 10
If anybody wanted to help they shouldve did it then
But they didnt and all it did was release the beast
So Im a feast on whatever I come across in the streets
Like the wind like the wind
God will take god will take
All my sins all of my sins
Blown away will be blown away
Like the wind like the wind
Like the wind like the wind
I had a S on my chest fuck the vest
Did robberies with some cats and robbed the rest
Other time I came thought with just me and my dog
And clear out the whole fuck block cause we when hard
I bag some niggaz I knew and some niggaz I didnt
I aint a fuck either way it was no bullshiting
Im a cruddy niggaz out to get money
And a couple of slugs is the only thing anybody took from me
Run up on a cat smooth like put it in his left ear
Give up the money the jewelry or get left here
Keep thinking its a game and play lets get popped
See how much fun you having when your heart be stopped
Shut em down open up shop ohoh nooh blow off a nigga top
Somebody call the cops but its to late
Cause Im a hit you in the face
and what will kill you will be something that you ate
Like the wind like the wind
God will take god will take
All my sins all of my sins
Blown away will be blown away
Like the wind like the wind
Like the wind like the wind
If pain is love why hide my pain with drugs
Choke off haze and sell attics coke for days
Same clothes and no soup to shave
And I still got a gun on my hip for your open grave
We used to get robbery vics
until my man got killed for his whip on some robbery shit
Then I switched to the weed and start selling crack
But I will pull a steel and put a shell up in ya back
I feel like all my life I was held up in a trap
like if I go to heaven maybe hell will want me back
But all I really want is sperwells up an a lap
And a model bitch sitting with a head in my lap
But since no doe dont spin
and my pant hole got hole within I got to fold ya men
Its obvious I live in a house of sin
I wish I could open up the door and let em blow at the wind

Chorus Swizz Beatz 2X
When I come thru everything gon stop
When I come thru everything gon stop
When I come thru everything gon stop
Now move move move move
X comes thru the hood like here comes trouble
Year of the dog again first week double
Low in the rider east coast nigga
Fo in the rider street loc nigga
Far for jiggie but like biggie bitches call me big poppa
I got a big dick and Id a pop her
Yea the kid talk shit but the kid dont front
How ever shit go give em what they want
I aint signing shit love my fans
But Cross this line with the camera in your hands
Cause it could get real ugly real thick
And you like this nigga real quick
Motherfuckin right I aint got time for the small talk
One of us has got to go down we cant all walk
You know this as well as I do
But I promise you Im go hide you and no one will find you
Stop nigga hold up you know I dont quit
You see Im back and Im comin to smash your shit
And ahhla back with the god and busabus nigga
This time Im bringin the shovel so I can come and dig another grave
For all of you bustards what the fuck you think you doin
Ill put a stop to your function and anybody movin
And then Ill fuck up production and any crew you flew in
You aint with me you against me The loser side you chosen
Anyway word to ears you niggas know I aint finished
Ill fuck up every hood and Im back to handle my business
You niggas thinking you though like you ate a can of spinach
In till we mash on you faggots and make you change up your image
Flip mode in this bitch Ruff Ryders is with me
You see we back on the block and yes we runnin the city
Now you niggas know the flow less aint controlin the committee
Nothing should be movin unless my crew in it you fell me
If there is money I want half
Niggas is funny to watch go head laugh
Aint nothing to smile about
For real all niggas is wildin out
Niggas who pound you out
We found you out in distance
Something like 28 days missin
And you know how the dessert do a nigga
Brake you down quick residue a nigga

and know that we miss them for selfish reasons
Oh lord my god in thea i put my trust save me from all them

we going to cross paths again until then im going to be that
and see that it speaks the truth believe that imma see that

My suffering will not be in vain
neither will your pain ever since u past i hear your name
rest in peace the autumn
we all know cancer cells kill but if they caught them they couldve fought them
if you still be here right here with us
we have plenty of time before death came and to get us
but what is death like should i really care
after looking at it was life really fair
did you burn any bridges did you make ammends
did you ask god for forgiveness for your sins
what is heaven like if u come back should you
if you could communicte from over there would you
Its questions we ask ourselves everyday
Cause we all go anyways imma say goobye today
cause it could be anyday imma say goodbye today
Weve grown in so many ways but im going to say goodbye today
cause it could be anyday imma say goodbye today
So young so gifted the direction of life was uplifting
when the wind shifting it took a turn for the worse
it took the best it come to curse nigga stressing
took the dog into the hurse my nigga devon was to young to die
fell out the nest and was way to young to fly
but that didnt stop fate from happening
had a time nigga make the devil tkae for what happenen

but until then my friend imma say goodbye today cause you never know when
Cause we all go anyways imma say goobye today

Cowards are stupid if you wanna see me prove it
Try and take my position watch a quick a nigga lose it
Make you get all my shit and have you fearing for your life
Every time you see me roll up or ride up on a bike
Dressed in all black with my pistol in your sight
But it will be my man in all white that walks up with a knife
Im a big boy baby I dont play with you thin niggas
Getting my hands dirty when theres beef I send niggas
