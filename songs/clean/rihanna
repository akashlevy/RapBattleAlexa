We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire
I say you see this is the American Dream
On the other side of the ocean
She can be anything at all
Just close your eyes and breathe
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire
You say you see this is the American Dream
Tryna get the wheels in motion
But he can be anything at all
Just close your eyes and breathe
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire
This is the new America
We are the new America
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire
This is the new America
We are the new America
There could be a freak accident
There could be a fatal disease
I know we hate to think about it
But this as real as you and me
This as real as you and me
We could all fall down
Before our Saviour could return
I know we hate to think about it
But its as real as you and me
The earth could quake to ruin
We could drift off in our sleep
I know we hate to think about it
But this as real as you and me
This as real as you and me
The ocean crushed the shore
And take us down forevermore
I know we hate to think about it
But this as real as you and me
I know we hate to think about it
But its as real as you and me
Its as real as you and me
Come and put your name on it
Put your name on it
Come and put your name on it
Bet you wanna put your name on it
Put your name on it
Come and put your name on it
Its not even my birthday
But he want to lick the icing off
I know you want it in the worst way
Cant wait to blow my candles out
He want that cake cake
Cake cake cake cake cake
Cake cake cake cake cake
Ooh baby I like it
Dont try to hide it
Imma make you my bitch
I know you wanna bite this
Imma make you my bitch
And its not even my birthday
But you wanna put your name on it
And its not even my birthday
And he tryna put his name on it
Oooh I wanna fuck you right now
Just get up on my body Lyrics submitted by Armani DavaSha

We were always just that close
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when i reach out my finger
It feels like more then distance between us
In this california king bed Were ten thousand miles apart
I been california wishing on these stars for your heart for me My california king
Eye to eye cheek to cheek side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm dusk to dawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when i reach out my fingers
It feels like more then distance between us
In this california king bed Were ten thousand miles apart
I been california wishing on these stars for your heart for me My california king
Just when i felt like giving up on us
You turned around and give me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But i dont wanna seems so weak
Maybe Ive been california dreaming
In this california king bed Were ten thousand miles apart
Ive been california wishing on these stars for your heart for me My california king
In this california king bed Were ten thousand miles apart
I been california wishing on these stars for your heart for me My california kingLyrics submitted by angelina

Nothing but a tear thats all for breakfast
Watching you pretend youre unaffected
Youre pulling our connections expecting me to let you go
No you dont need my protection
But Im in love cant blame me for checking
I look in your direction hoping that the message goes
Like so close if they heard you you wouldnt find out
Just say now Im coming right now to be close to you
Said you let it go you kept it
Working hard to perfect it
Now your fear is reckless and its out of your control
Would you let it go
No you dont need my protection
But Im in love cant blame me for checking
I look in your direction hoping that the message goes
Like so close if they heard you you wouldnt find out
If you let me Id be there by now
Dark and Im burning a rose
Im torn apart you know
What you did to me was a crime
And I let you reach me one more time
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So pick me up when its over
It dont make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall
Truth was there all along
Tell me how did we miss it
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints pictures white outlines
Are all thats left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
And then I tried to cage it
But your love aint the kind you can keep
Release me now cause I did my time
Of this cold case love
My hearts no longer cold confined
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So pick me up when its over
It dont make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall
Truth was there all along
Tell me how did we miss it
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints pictures white outlines
Are all thats left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
Now Ill never find the pieces of my heart
That was here all along
And it got the best of us
And now prints pictures white outlines
Are all thats left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints pictures white outlines
Are all thats left at the scene of a crime

Youre not easy to love
Youre not easy to love no
Youre not easy to love
Youre not easy to love no
Why is everything with you so complicated
Why do you make it hard to love you oh I hate it
Cause if ya really wanna be alone
I will throw my hands up cause baby I tried
Everything with you is so complicated
Sometimes its you I cant stand
Sometimes I wanna hug you
Sometimes I wanna push you away
Most times I wanna kiss you
Other times punch you in the face
Cause every minute you start switching up
And you say things like you dont give a fck
Then I say Im through with you
Take my heart from you
And you come runnin after me and baby Im back with you
Youre not easy to love
Youre not easy to love no
Youre not easy to love

Why is everything with you so complicated
Why do you make it hard to love you oh I hate it
Cause if ya really wanna be alone
I will throw my hands up cause baby I tried
Everything with you is so complicated
Other times Im like where are you on the page
Sometimes I feel like we will be together forever
Why is everything with you so complicated
Why do you make it hard to love you oh I hate it
Cause if ya really wanna be alone
I will throw my hands up cause baby I tried
Everything with you is so complicated
Ima stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure that youre really sure you like sleeping alone
Why is everything with you so complicated
Why do you make it hard to love you oh I hate it
Cause if ya really wanna be alone
I will throw my hands up cause baby I tried
Everything with you is so complicated

Im not the type to get my heart broken
Im not the type to get upset and cry
Cos I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don’t get deep to me
Never got the whole in love thing
And someone can say they loved me truly
But at the time it didnt mean a thing
This is how I feel
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I’m in this condition
And I got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
You’ll never see me cry
Did it happen when we first kissed
Cos it’s hurting me to let it go
Maybe cos we spent so much time
And I know that is no more
I should have never let you hold me baby
Maybe why im sad to see us apart
I didn’t give it to you on purpose
cant figure out how you stole my heart
This is how I feel
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I’m in this condition
And I got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
You’ll never see me cry
How did I get here with you
I never meant to let it get so personal
And after all I tried to do
To stay away from love with you
I can’t let you know
And I Won’t Let It Show
You won’t see me cry
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife

I wanna dance in the dark
Were gonna light up the night
I wanna dance in the dark
Were gonna light up the night
Underdogs dance in the middle of the night
Can see the night skies in the mirror of your eyes
If you dont dance make sure you got the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
I wanna run wild in the middle of the night
Right under the moon bodies glowing in the night
Nothing in between our skins but the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
The night time is the right time
I wanna dance in the dark
Were gonna light up the night
Whenever you hear the sound
Oh oh oh dancing in the dark
Underdogs dance in the middle of the night
Out here with the stars like the creatures of the night
If you dont dance make sure you got the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
Sitting in a old Monte Carlo
A man whose heart is hollow
Uh huh take it easy
I’m not tryna go against you
Actually I’m going with you
Gotta get up out of here
And you ain’t leaving me behind
I know you wont cause we share common interests
You need me there ain’t no leaving me behind
Never know no just want out of here
Yeah once were gone ain’t no going back
If you want take a peek and run away
Running from and it’s out of luck
Yeah yeah there ain’t nothing
There ain’t nothing here for me
There ain’t nothing here for me anymore
But I don’t wanna be alone
Sitting in an old Monte Carlo
Weve both had our hearts broken
Im not trying to go against you
I can be a lone wolf fishing
Gotta get up out of here
And you ain’t leaving me behind
I know you wont cause we share common interests
You need me there ain’t no leaving me behind
Never know no both flying out of here
Yeah once were gone ain’t no going back
If you want we could be runaways
Running from and it’s out of luck
Yeah yeah there ain’t nothing
There ain’t nothing here for me
There ain’t nothing here for me anymore
I don’t wanna be alone
Yeah I don’t wanna be alone
Yeah I don’t wanna be alone
If you want we could be runaways
Running from and it’s out of luck
Yeah yeah there ain’t nothing
There ain’t nothing here for me
There ain’t nothing here for me anymore
But I don’t wanna be alone

Why do I feel like this
No more gas in the rig cant even get it started
Nothing heard nothing said cant even speak about it
On my life on my head dont wanna think about it

It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind it can control you
Its too close for comfort
Put on your pretty lies youre in the city of wonder
Aint gon play nice watch out you might just go under
Better think twice your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise

Nothing can sober me up
Its all that I need
But never been tainted
So I stay thirsty for more

You Know that Im drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
Drunk drunk on love

Go on begone bye bye so long

Cant you see that youre
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today today its too late
Youre fading away Lyrics submitted by lovey brown
Can you let me know
I dont mind catching up
Just cant take the thought of you miles away
And I know you’re going somewhere to make a better life
I hope that you find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know itll be sadder
If you never hit the road
Somebody is gonna miss you
Somebody is gonna wish that you were here
I will write to tell you whats going on
But you wont miss nothing but the same old song
If you dont mind catching up
Ill spend the day telling you stories about a land far away
And I know you’re going somewhere to make a better life
I hope that you find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know itll be sadder
If you never hit the road
Somebody is gonna miss you
Somebody is gonna wish that you were here
Somebody is gonna miss you
Somebody is gonna wish that you were here
And Im gon try to hold it all in
Try to hold back my tears
So it dont make you stay here
Imma try to be a big girl now
Cause I dont wanna be the reason you dont leave
Somebody is gonna miss you
Somebody is gonna wish that you were here
Somebody is gonna miss you
Somebody is gonna wish that you were here
That somebody is meLyrics submitted by Khristal Nick
I never should have waited so long to say
What ive always known since the very first day
Thought that you would stya forever with me
But the time have come too leave
Before we turn off da lights close our eyes
Ill tell u a secret ive held all my life
Its you that i live for for you I die
So ill lay here with you till the final goodbye
Hold draw me close close to my lips
Listen intently as i tell you this
Outside the world wages its wars
Ill rest in peace as long as you know
Before we turn out the lights close our eyes
Ill tell you a secret Ive held all my life
Its you that i live for for you i die
So ill lay here with you till the final goodbye
Promise you our love will carry on
Until you turn eternal we belong
Before we turn out the lights close our eyes
Ill tell you a secret Ive held all my life
Its you that i live for for you i die
So ill lay here with you till the final goodbye goodbyeLyrics submitted by RIGOBERTO
Gunfire left a hole
Fire is on my trail
And he’s after me
Hope it don’t get here
Before I get where I’m going
I gotta get where I’m going
Take off my mask to breath
You could’ve been a apart of a
Fluid in the breaks
Was the last to leak
I don’t need my breaks
Cant wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through
The lovers need to clear the road
Cause this thing is ready to blow
I just wanna set you on fire
So I don’t have to burn alone
Then you’ll know where
Doesn’t have to be
Like the way that Im at
Its beautiful and its blue
And its blue as the other half of me
Its the other half of me
I didn’t do it
You lit the match from me
From the blast baby
We don’t need no breaks
Cant wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through
The lovers need to clear the road
Cause this thing is ready to blow
I just wanna set you on fire
So I don’t have to burn alone
Then you’ll know where
Baby we were killing them
They couldn’t handle the millionth degree
As we were burning
The world called the police
You can call me crazy cause I believe
The only move for me and you
Is to blow our flames
The lovers need to clear the road
Cause this thing is ready to blow
I just wanna set you on fire
So I don’t have to burn alone
Then you’ll know where

You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone

Cats dont want her to keep that dress on
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim
Patron on brain ball play you in the face
They shake the spot shes just another case
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone gone
Best believe weve gone forever
You better learn how to treat us right
Cause once a good girl goes bad
Hes staying with a flock of them oh yeah
Got a girl at home but he dont care
All hell do is keep me at home wont let me go nowhere
He thinks because Im at home I wont be getting it on
And now Im finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house non stop its

And I hate how much I love you boy yeah
I cant stand how much I need you I need you
And I hate how much I love you boy oh whoa
But I just cant let you go
And I hate that I love you so oh
You completely know the power that you have
The only one makes me laugh
How you take advantage of the fact
That I love you beyond the reason why
And it just aint right
And I hate how much I love you girl
I cant stand how much I need you yeah
And I hate how much I love you girl
But I just cant let you go
But I hate that I love you so
One of these days maybe your magic wont affect me
And your kiss wont make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So youll probably always have a spell on me
Thats how much I love you as much as I need you
Thats how much I need you oh
Thats how much I love you oh
As much as I need you
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate how much I love you boy
I cant stand how much I need you cant stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you boy
But I just cant let you go but I just cant let you go no
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate that I love you so soLyrics submitted by shane

Midair off of the cliff
Staring down at the end again
The road thats headed away
Of hearing the same song
But babe you wont hear it when im gone
and Its time to turn on
What if you wasted love and all of our time disappeared
And this sad song ends up being the last song youll ever hear
But id do it again
Holding hands with my friend again
Maybe we gave our all
A song theyll never forget
Baby let em play it
Maybe itll save the world
They gon miss hearing it when itsgone
What if we loved every moment that we could spare
And the perfect song ends up being the last song youll ever hear
You never know where the songs gonna fade
The Last song you hear is the one you made
Thats why I started singing it
But this song is ours
So lets play it till the end
Even if itsLyrics submitted by tyrae
Once was a time you and I
Made a promise till the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that Id get burned
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife
Its the last time youre ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy its the last time
Im ever gonna cry these tears
Im never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didnt hear
This times the last time
To give it one more try
Theres only time to say goodbye
Fooled me once shame on you
Fooled me twice now this song is through
The things you said I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But Im still standing tall as I walk away
And you know that its true when you hear me say
Aint a thing you can do boy its sad but its true
Its the last time youre ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy its the last time
Im ever gonna cry these tears
Im never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didnt hear
This times the last time
To give it one more try
Theres only time to say goodbye
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife
Its the last time youre ever gonna kiss these lips ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy its the last time
Im ever gonna cry these tears
Im never gonna hear your lies never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didnt hear
This times the last time
To give it one more try
Aint a thing you can do but wonder why
Theres only time to say goodbye
Never gonna never gonna cry no more
What am I supposed to do with this heart
How do I take it off if I love it on its like a work of art
How was I to know that my love was delusional
Somebody tell me how to mend a brokenhearted soul
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart
It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise
Im so lost in paradise lost in paradise
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm I can see the sky
I can see the darkness flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay Im lost in paradise
How was I to know that my love was delusional
Somebody tell me how to mend a brokenhearted soul
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart
It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise
Im so lost in paradise lost in paradise
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm I can see the sky
I can see the darkness flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay Im lost in paradise
What am I supposed to do with this heart 3x
It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise
Im so lost in paradise lost in paradise
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm I can see the sky
I can see the darkness flashing lights

If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm I can see the sky
I can see the darkness flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight

On the first page of our story the future seemed so bright
And this thing turned out so evil I don’t know why I’m still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes and you take that to new extremes
But you’ll always be my hero even though you lost your mind
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now this gravel in our voices glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you’ll always win even when I’m right
Cause you feed me fables from your hand
With violent words and empty threats and it’s sick that all these battles are what keeps me satisfied
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie
Ohhh I love the way you lie
So maybe I’m a masochist
I try to run but I don’t wanna ever leave
Til the walls are goin’ up in smoke with all our memories
Eminem
This morning you wake a sunray hits your face
smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
hush baby speak softly tell me I’ll be sorry that you
pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
run out the room and I’ll follow you like a lost puppy
baby without you I’m nothing I’m so lost hug me
then tell me how ugly I am but that you’ll always love me
then after that shove me in the aftermath of the
destructive path that we’re on two psychopaths but we
know that no matter how many knives we put in each other’s backs
that we’ll have each other’s backs ’cause we’re that lucky
together we move mountains let’s not make mountains out of molehills
you hit me twice yeah but who’s countin’
I may have hit you three times I’m startin’ to lose count
but together we’ll live forever we found the youth fountain
our love is crazy we’re nuts but I refused counselin’
this house is too huge if you move out I’ll burn all two thousand
square feet of it to the ground ain’t shit you can do about it
with you I’m in my f–kin’ mind without you I’m out it
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie
Ohhh I love the way you lie

I didnt mean to end his life
I know it wasnt right
I cant even sleep at night
Cant get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight
Before I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that Im facing
Cause I didnt mean to hurt him
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Rum pum pum rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum
I just shot a man down
In front of a big ol crowd
I just shot a man down
I Call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
What you expect me to do
If youre playing me for a fool
I will lose my cool
And reach for my fire arm
I didnt mean to lay him down
But its too late to turn back now
Dont know what I was thinking
Now hes no longer living
So Im ‘bout to leave town yeah
Cause I didnt mean to hurt him
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum
I just shot a man down
In front of a big ol crowd
I just shot a man down
And I never thought Id do it
Never thought Id do it
Never thought Id do it
Why did I pull the trigger
Pull the trigger pull the trigger – boom
And end a nigga end a nigga life so soon
When me pull the trigger pull the trigger pull it pon you
Somebody tell me what Im gonna what Im gonna do
Rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum
Me say one man down oh let me say
Rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum rum pum pum pum
Cause now I am a criminal criminal criminal
Oh lord have mercy now I am a criminal
Tell the judge please gimme minimal
Run out a town none a them can see me now
I just shot a man down
In front of a big ol crowd
I just shot a man down
I knew your face once but now its unclear
And I cant feel my body now
Im separate from here and now
A drug and a drink
We lost connection oh come back to me
So I can feel alive again
Soul and body try to mend
Its pulling me apart this time
Slipped into a peril that Ill never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesnt have to feel so strange
To be in love again
To be in love again
To be in love again
I knew your face once but now its unclear
And I cant feel my body now
Im separate from here and now
Its pulling me apart this time
Slipped into a peril that Ill never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesnt have to feel so strange
To be in love again
To be in love again
To be in love again
911 its a critical emergency yea
Come and charge him with the 143 yea yea
Told me this world was mine
Now hes done done done and his love is no more for me
hand in the air as he wave me goodbye
He said he care but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if Im alright
Like a bullet your love me hit me to core
I was flying til you knocked me to the floor
And its so foolish of you keep me wanting more
Im screaming murderer how could you murder us
I call it murder no love allowed
Fe fo fum like the sky is falling down on me
Numb numb numb hes so cold he doesnt feel a thing
Broken heart was the case
Gwan and put im away
Hes the only one one one I ever let get the best of me
hand in the air as he wave me goodbye
He said he care but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if Im alright
Like a bullet your love me hit me to core
I was flying til you knocked me to the floor
And its so foolish of you keep me wanting more
Im screaming murderer how could you murder us
I call it murder no love allowed
Usually Im the one that they cry for
But this man hes the one that Id die for
Mama said theres no cause for a rebel
Do you hear me now
No love no love no love allowed
Like a bullet your love me hit me to core
I was flying til you knocked me to the floor
And its so foolish of you keep me wanting more

Heres a little story i gotta tell
About this boy I know so well
back in the day it was cool and all
fell in love i fell in love
I thought he was the one for me
other boys i could not see
and look what happened to him
a love that couldnt be
It should have been me and you
it could have been you and me
before you broke my heart and Im
It should have been me and you
it could have been you and me
now all i got are these photographs
Now baby its killing me
Im saying its killing me
the fact that you went around
I may need a remedy
I need you to be around
I know your a better man
when i was your girl
This land is a better land
When your in my world
today will be better babe
If it were like yesterday
All Ive got are these photographs
I remember when I use to make you laugh
I dont wanna be stuck in the past
but your all that I have that I have
I dont wanna loose what we built this far
Its just me an you your my superstar
Ill give anything baby heres my heartmy heartmy heart

even though that its over
girl I been reminiscing
when I play that Casanova
way back when we was kissing

I got them pictures back when I was rockin calvinklein
you had yo guess jeans on

I am not the one
Why couldn’t you be the one

Throw it throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up Pour It Up
Thats how we ball out
Throw it throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up Pour It Up
Thats how we ball out
Strip clubs and dollar bills
I still got my money
Patron shots can I get a refill
I still got my money
Strippers going up and down that pole
And I still got my money
Four o clock and we aint going home
Cause I still got my money
Money make the world go around
I still got my money
Bandz make your girl go down
And I still got my money
Lot mo where dat came from
I still got my money
The minute you wise you know you want some
I still got my money
All I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Money money on my mind
Throw it throw it up
Watch it fall off from the sky
Throw it throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up Pour It Up
Thats how we ball out
Throw it throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up Pour It Up
Thats how we ball out
Thats how we ball out
Thats how we ball out
Thats how we ball out
Valet cost a hundred bills
I still got my money
Gold all up in my grill
I still got my money
Who cares how you haters feel
And I still got my money
Call J up and close a deal
I still got my money
My fragance on and they love my smell
I still got my money
So who cares about what I spend
I still got my money
My pockets deep and they never end
I still got my money
Im going dumb with all my friends
I still got my money
Ohhh all I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Ohhhhh money on my mind
Money money on my mind
Throw it throw it up
Watch it fall off from the sky
Throw it throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up Pour It Up

The ways you hurt me
Its gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And youre the one to blame
And now I feel like oh

Take a Breathe take it deep
Calm yourself he says to me
If you play you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
Im sweating now moving slow
No time to think my turn to go
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said Im terrified but Im not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger
Say a prayer to yourself
He says close your eyes sometimes it helps
And then I get a scary thought
That hes here means hes never lost
And you can see my heart beating
Ohyou can see it through my chest
Said Im terrified but Im not leaving
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger
As my life flashes before my eyes
Im wondering if I will ever see another sunrise
So many wont get the chance to say goodbye
But its to late to think of the value of my life
And you can see my heart beating
Oh you can see it through my chest
Im terrified but Im not leaving no
Know that I must pass this test

I can just hear them now
How could you let us down
But they dont know what I found
Or see it from this way around
All that I used to hate
I tried but its way too late
All the signs I dont read
Two sides of me cant agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for
Feel like a brand new person
But you make the same old mistakes
I don’t care I’m in love
Stop before it’s too late
Feel like a brand new person
But you make the same old mistakes
I finally know what is love
You don’t have what it takes
Stop before it’s not too late
I know there’s too much at stake
And I still don’t know why it’s happening
Stop while it’s not too late
And I still don’t know
I know you dont think its right
I know that you think its fake
Maybe fakes what I like
Point is I have the right
Im thinking in black and white
Im thinking its worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for
Feel like a brand new person
But you make the same old mistakes
But I don’t care I’m in love
Stop before it’s too late
Feel like a brand new person
But you make the same old mistakes
So how do I know that its right
You don’t have what it takes
Stop before it’s not too late
Man I know that its hard to digest
But maybe this story ain’t so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But youve got your demons and shes got her regrets
And I know that its hard to digest
A realization is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But youve got your demons and shes got her regrets
But youve got your demons and shes got her regrets
Feel like a brand new person
So how will I know that its right
So how will I know Ive gone too far
Stop thinking Youre the only option was
Feel like a brand new person
I finally know what its like
Stop thinking youre the only option oh
So how will I know Ive gone too far
Stop thinking youre the only option oh
And I know its hard to describe
Stop thinking youre the only option oh
So how will I know that its right
Stop thinking youre the only option oh
I finally know what its like
Stop thinking youre the only option oh

Sell me candy like it’s summer when it’s melting in my hands
I know you’re around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling whisper something in my ear
Youre sweet like sugar tell me what I wanna hear
I’m weak by your touch and when it’s melting on my lips
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips
You’re selling me a fantasy that I want to explore
It sounds so good spoil me rotten to the core
Take care of my dreams
Then baby sell it to me
Sell me candy sell me love sell me heaven sell me doves
What’s the charge What’s the cost
I’m the daddy… you the boss
You could be a professional boy you make a sale
I try to resist but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
The running through my body now you’re knocking at my door
A thin little kiss and your call is really sweet
But the shawty that you’re rocking is nothing like me
You’re selling me a fantasy that I want to explore
It sounds so good spoil me rotten to the core you know…
I wanna play… more than you know
So don’t you leave… and don’t you go
I want it all… until time falls
His arms… I want to roam
I want to love… give him my trust
I want to live… for both of us
I want to breathe you… lay on your shoulder
I want to warm you… when nights get colder
I want love… love… love
I want love… love… love

Ive been looking for a driver whos qualified
So if you think that youre the one step into my ride
Im a finetuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangster lean
So if you feel me let me know know know
Come on now what you waiting for for for

All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hotheaded believer
I threw my hands in the air and said show me something
He said if you dare come a little closer
Round and around and around and around we go
Ohhh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I cant live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay
Its not much of a life youre living
Its not just something you take its given
Round and around and around and around we go
Ohhh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I cant live without you
And it takes me all the way
And I want you to stay
Ohhh the reason I hold on
Ohhh cause I need this hole gone
Funny youre the broken one but Im the only one who needed saving
Cause when you never see the light its hard to know which one of us is caving
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I cant live without you
And it takes me all the way

Let me tell you something
Never have I ever
Been a size 10
In my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see
What you would do if I
Gave you a chance
To make things right
So I made it
Told me this would be nothing
But a waste of time
And she was right
Blood on your hands
And still you insist
To tell me lies
And I just dont know why
Dont talk to me
I still love you
But I just cant do this
I may be dumb but
Thats what my friends
Are calling me when
They see me yelling
They tell me let go
He is not the one
I thought I saw your potential
Guess thats what made me dumb
He dont want it
Not like you want it
Oh girl why do you
You know he aint right
I dont wanna listen
To tell me lies
And I just dont know why
Dont talk to me
I still love you
But I just cant do this
I may be dumb but
Trying to make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep
But the dunce cap is off
You dont know what you lost
And you wont realize
Till Im gone gone gone
That I was the one
Which one of us
Im not stupid in love
Dont talk to me
I still love you
But I just cant do this
I may be dumb but
I may be dumb but
In loveLyrics submitted by Maria
Oh How about a round of applause Yeah
You look so dumb right now
Youre so ugly when you cry
Please just cut it out
Dont tell me youre sorry cause youre not
Baby when I know youre only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
But now its time to go
That was quite a show
But its over now but its over now
Go on and take a bow
Grab your clothes and get gone get gone
Before the sprinklers come on come on
Girl I love you youre the one
This just looks like a rerun
Please what else is on on
Oh And the award for
The best liar goes to you goes to you
For making me believe that you
That you could be faithful to me
Lets hear your speech Oh
How about a round of applause
But you put on quite a show
Now its time to go
That was quite a show

I hear the pain in her voice
and we danced underneath the candelabra
thats when I saw it in her eyes its over
Then she says te amo
then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
I told her I’m not gonna run away
My soul is crying
I said te amo
would somebody tell me what she said
Don’t it mean I love you
Think it means I love you
Don’t it mean I love you
I hold her hand I got no choice uhh
Pull me out on the beach danced in the water
She’s begging me and asking why its over
Then she says te amo
then she put her hand around me waist
I told her I’m not gonna run away
would somebody tell me what she said
Don’t it mean I love you
Think it means I love you
don’t it mean I love you
Listen we can dance
but you gotta watch your hands
watch me all night I’m movin to the night because I understand
that we all need love
to feel the love but I don’t feel that way
Then she says te amo
then she put her hand around me waist
I told her I’m not gonna run away but let me go
would somebody tell me what she said
Dont it mean I love you

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Dont look back just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Lost in the rock and roll
Got lost in a promise of a love I never know
Shadows chase me far from home
I remember when my heart was filled with gold
Ive been burned Ive been burned Ive been burned
Youve seen me lose control
Its not worth its not worth its not worth
Lost my faith and trust
You and I know gold dont turn to rust
I still swear that we can reign
Like the kings and queens of better yesterdays
Ive been burned Ive been burned Ive been burned
Youve seen me lose control
Its not worth its not worth its not worth
Where you gonna go where you gonna go
Where you gonna run to
When you get to the edge of the night
Its time you face the sky ooh
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you

But it keeps avoiding me
Cause it seems that wrong
Hes more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
But the clouds are rolling in
And to him I just cant be true
And I know that he knows im unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that im happy
I can see him dying
I dont wanna do this anymore
I dont wanna be the reason why
everytime I walk out the door
I see him die a litle more inside
I dont wanna hurt him anymore
I dont wanna take away his life
I dont wanna be murderer
I feel it in the air
As im doing my hair
A kiss upon my cheek
As if im gonna be out late
I say I wont be long
Just hanging with the girls
A lie I didnt have to tell
where im about to go
and we know it very well
Cause I know that he knows im unfaithful
and it kills him inside
To know that im happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I dont wanna do this anymore
I dont wanna be the reason why
Cause every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I dont wanna hurt him anymore
I dont wanna take away his life
I dont wanna be a murderer
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
I dont wanna do thisanymore
I dont wanna do this anymore

I see him die a little more inside

Swing away if ya feeling brave

If you pop up and you say it steady
Im gon do da wave
Im such a fucking lady
You dont have to be so afraid
Cause I got room up on my team
You can play but hold up
Its just the way the game is played
Its best that you just wait your turn
Its getting crowded over here
But babethe wait is ova
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
Thats a flag on the play
Babe if you dont wanna
Then you dont have to wait
But together we gon be taking over
Its just the way the game is played
Its best if you just wait your turn
So you dont wanna wait
I hate to hearThats such a shame
Cause if you play it sideways
Aint no time out in ma game
Dey aready on da way
I know you wanna win
and you wish I would let you in
Get in line over here
You can play but hold up
Its just the way the game is played
Its best that you just wait your turn
Its getting crowded over here
But babethe wait is ova
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
Thats a flag on the play
Babe if you dont wanna
Then you dont have to wait
But together we gonbe taking ova
Its just the way the game is played
Its best that you just wait your turn
Baby put the work in like a champion
Look the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Couldnt be with no one else
Youre the only way Ill win
Baby got the whole world standing up
Damn Im glad I picked ya took a chance on love
And now the wait is ovaaaaaaa
The wait is ova the wait is ova

The wait is ova the wait is ova

Its getting crowded over here
But babe the wait is ova
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
Thats a flag on the play
Babe if you dont wanna
Then you dont have to wait
But together we gon be taking ova
Its just the way the game is played
Its best that you just wait your turn
The wait is ova the wait is ova
the wait is ova the wait is ovaLyrics submitted by Leandra
