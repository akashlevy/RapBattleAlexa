Everyday is the same thang I creep in
Its like true blood I sink my teeth in
I gotta have it the L B raisement
We was taught to dig em down crazy
Lights out Im so lit
Mamas so gone daddy wont quit
I wont stop till yur finished
But yu aint felt love till a gangsta get up in it Dream
Run off on me like click clack
Throw it out like take that
She make it do what it do when we doing what we do in back of the lac
Im like Im up all for that and every night her body gets straped how bout
Gangstaa G Gangsta Gangstaa G Gangstaa Gangstaa G Gangstaa
This the life that yu show
The loop the coop the grows
Its so good got her wiggling her toes wow
All these things really dont mean a thing
When Im tearing that ass up workin yu like a shift
I give it to yu like a gift
Yu hear what that boy say
Yu wouldnt jack give it up fast
Then I hit it from the back
Snoopy your so good she screaming I like that girl
She off in another world
I aint stop till yur finished
She love this gangsta espically when Im in it Dream
