Chorus Mary J Blige
Now we Shinin hard
just like we want to do
grindin day and night
so we can kick off our shoes
and live a glamorous life
look what we made it too
we some real life hustlas
got em lookin at you
We grind hard ohhhh
to play harder ohhhh
we touch the stars ohhh
thats what they call us ohhh
we grind hard ohhh
to buy the mall up ohhh
we grind hard ohhh
to play harder harder
if we aint breaking them down
then we letting them fly
nah never I always we
I came in the game dividing the pies by three
then we got famish
so we set standards
very similar to the ten crack commandments
some couldnt take it
others got lost and couldnt make it
he wanted to floss but couldnt fake it
the hood embraced it
the rest is basics
no need to rush be extra patient
the new 4 door Porsche is extra spacious
same entourage no extra faces
hands down the best no explanations
and to the top is the next destination
there aint no time outs
death is the only time we gon sign out
so we gon grind out
Chorus Mary J Blige
Now we Shinin hard

Top 5 dead or alive what they consider them
soon as them things come in we get rid of em
mo money mo problems gota live with em
only thing they care about is what you givin them
not the energy that you wasted in the game
or the tears that tripled down your face from the pain
the time the jaw cracked you wasted the cane
had to do two shifts to make it the same
that all changed soon as you tasted the fame
and it was all worth it after you made you a name
thanks to our heavily father
we fly on the jet now instead of the charter
leave a nice tip in the front for the gardener
do all of listening so we stay smarter
everybodys a hero when they get scarred up
its my ball check it up yall better guard up
Chorus Mary J Blige
Now we Shinin hard

Bridge Mary J Blige
We step up out of our car

Yeah yo Im the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
Mother of pearl delivery voice of God
Andits hard just being the boss
Being I cant go to jail cause them yearsll cost me
Dont get me wrong lay a nigga down if he force me
Rather just sit back and roll a dutch
Think how Ima put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how Ima get the caine over Customs
Never underestimate niggaz or over trust them
Uhyeah them Ms is right in my face
I just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it dont jam the Tech will spray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
Cause Im a nigga that hate to settle
Im a man of the Lord but I still cant escape the devil
Moved away and still cant escape the ghetto what
The time to talk is up
So bring the heat that time is over
While you running your mouth Im creeping up over your shoulder
A gun a knife a bat a brick anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff start acting up and Ill leave you underground
I know how to get my pairs off me
They can cry and die from high blood pressure cause tears are salty
Its a symptom if you bobbin your head
Know that hes sick know the flow is ridic now throw him a grip
When I get it you already know Im throwin them bricks
Puttin purple everywhere daddy Im throwin them nicks
Thats right homey you cant move me
I aint goin nowhere Im in the hood like bootleg movies
All you shootin is the breeze a bootleg uzi
Im just waitin on a que like Suzie dont lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
Into something else thatll make something melt
You just gotta feel the kid
if not rap for the fact of how real he is whatever
Aiyo niggaz know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap now he put out two anthems a year
And I just wanna rock for a century
Then chase the book with the documentary
If you cant do nothin other than flow
Lifes a bitch like the mother from Blow lets go
Dont make me put your heart in your lap
Fuck ridin the beat nigga I parallel park on the track
Hop out lookin crispy fresh and new
In the six but its a BM and its Pepsi blue
And I dont know you
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Yall aint fuckin with Jason
After I cash in theres really no justification
Of how Im gonna change the game so dont get outta line
Cause this little nine will change your frame what up
Youre the only one I love
The only man I know that I can trust
And if I ever should need u
I know youd come
Ready to kill with a smoking gun
Echo with a smoking gun
Yo Shawty is courageous
Going through the stages
Of where her body is more mature
Than her age is
Far from the daddys little girl type
Cant even imagine what her worlds like
It all started off as a youngin
Stepfather used to touch her
And she couldnt say nothing
The more she held in the pain
Eventually it scarred her for life as a woman
And then he just kept touching her
Inside that was crushing her
I got something to discuss with her
Im coming with the tech
With the ear holes and the mufflers
Jasmine SullivanYoure the only one I love
The only man I know that I can trust
And if I ever should need u
I know youd come
Ready to kill with a smoking gun
Echo with a smoking gun
With a smoking gun
With a smoking gun
I know youd come
With a smoking gun
I know ull run
With a smoking gun
Yo now she really stressed bad
Baby by her step dad
Her and lil man
All alone up in Westhave
And without a car
Its a tough walk
Worse part about it
Is her mom think its her fault
Word get around yall
Know how the town talk
Baby girl is innocent
Labeled ah the town whore
Suicidial thoughts on her mind
Now she gotta raise her child poor
And thats why I feel for you
Thats why Im ready to kill for you
Thats a black girl lost for ya
Im come through and let it off for ya
Youre the only one I love
The only man I know that I can trust
And if I ever should need u
I know youd come
Ready to kill with a smoking gun
Echo with a smoking gun
With a smoking gun
With a smoking gun
I know youd come
With a smoking gun
I know ull run
With a smoking gun
It aint your fault boo
Im always here for you to talk to
Hold your head high when you walk through
Sometimes the devils temptation would force you
One thing about the Lord
Hed never cross you
Look at all the bad things that they tried to do to you
And youre still queen of this earth and youre beautiful
Everything happens for a reason
If you ever need me
Youre the only one I love
The only man I know that I can trust
And if I ever should need u
I know youd come
Ready to kill with a smoking gun
Echo with a smoking gun
With a smoking gun
With a smoking gun
I know youd come
With a smoking gun
I know ull run
With a smoking gunLyrics submitted by Alayna
