The other night Lavish Lee told me that Im all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasnt you you would be dissin you dawg
Damn okay from that perspective
I see what youre talkin bout no way to soften that
Cause me I was tryna find out where I lost em at
But maybe I aint lose em at all
Maybe I keep movin forward and theyre just stagnant they aint movin at all
But when they need a favor who do they call
Maybe Im searchin for the problems askin what was said and who was involved
Too focused on peoples feedback and provin em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit no matter whose foot its on
These days feel like Im squeezin in em
Whoever wore em before just wasnt thinkin big enough
Im bout to leave em with em
Cause if I run in the game in these man the seams are splittin
No pun intended but theyre smellin defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it who meetin me there
They tell him that hes talkin crazy but he doesnt care
Bein humble dont work as well as bein aware
Listen up boy youre better off eavesdroppin
We already got spring 2015 poppin
PND droppin Repsup P droppin
Majid Jordan droppin OB droppin not to mention me droppin
Feel like we paid the refs off man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah been on the move like the lease is up
And I cant even name one person thats keepin up
Damn fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself how do we match up now
Cause Im only 27 and Im only gettin better
If I havent passed you yet watch me catch up now forreal
Could it be the way that Ill catch up
Could it be the way that Ill catch up
Could it be the way that Ill catch up
Could it be the way that Ill catch up
Could it be the way that Ill catch up
Could it be the way that Ill catch up

Its a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch I know you heard things
Yeah I know you heard things I know you
Im not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
Im not new to this
Niggas wouldnt make it on this side
Im not new to this
Im not new Im not new
Yeah I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah all I ever needed was the squad so thats whats up
Yeah my sound got the whole city in your way right now
So I dont give a fuck about what anybody sayin right now
Boomin out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will
6 man like Lou Will 2 girls and they get along like Im Louuuu
Like Im Lou Will I just got the new deal
I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill
No ho shit no fuckin ho shit save that for your shit
I dont need no fuckin body I run my own shit
I told yah thought I told yah you didnt listen
Fieri Im in the kitchen Im a magician
Im on it Im like Macgyver Im Michael Myers
I kill careers and cut the lights off this shit is frightenin
I knew it would end up like this Im fuckin psychic
Young but Im makin millions to work a night shift
Young but Im makin millions to work the night shift
Work work the night shift
Young but Im gettin every single motherfuckin thing Im owed
Im here to fuck with niggas souls my heart is cold
Its prolly cause Im from the snow with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go Im on a roll
I mean Im back on this again Im here again
You know the truth lets not pretend Im not your friend
Not your guy Im not your buddy show no lovin
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man Im back on this again Im here again
I didnt do this fuckin tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards that shit looked forced
Young but Im makin millions to work the night shift
If you were worried about where
Ive been or who I saw or
What club I went to with the homies
Baby dont worry you know that you got me
Im never worried about where
Im at or who I saw or
What club I go to with the homies
Baby dont worry I know that they got me
Yeah yeah oh you gotta love it
Oh you got oh you gotta love it
I heard what circulated lets get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover
The game is all mine and Im mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight wonder whats next for me
Longevity wonder how long theyll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation but cant change it alone
I heard a little little homie talking reckless in Vibe
Thats quite a platform you chose you shouldve kept it inside
Its so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girls age
It gets worse by the annual my careers like a how to manual
So I guess its understandable man
Oh you gotta love it you gotta love it cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get em
To show they outfits off guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed man who are we kiddin
Im managed by my friends that I grew up with
Id rather give that 15 to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadnt made it with this rappin
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we have words
And stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women Im overtextin are PMSing crazy this year
Ive been tryna reach the youth so I can save em this year
Fuck it I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
Bout how we need protection from those protectin the block
Nobody lookin out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to RIP about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn I just had to say my piece about it
Oh you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin out in public
Ive been whippin Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley Tasha Biama Julia Ericka Southern America
Part of my heritage pardon my arrogance part in my hair again
Thats that comeback flow comeback flow
Once I start its apparent
Im with girl whose ass is so big thats partly embarrassin
But fuck all the blushin and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately whats irkin you
Shit is gettin so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that Im number one over all these niggas
Bein number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music nobody seein us
Winter here already but somehow Im heatin up
Been observin the game and felt like Ive seen enough
Lets drop a tape on these niggas then well see whats up
Yeah boy you rappin like you seen it all
You rappin like the throne should be the three of yall
Best I Ever Had seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please take it ease wheres the love and the peace
Why you rappin like you come from the streets
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And Im never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody thats comin for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin like its just 40 Oli and me
Cuttin all loose ends I be the barber for free
Im almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like Im in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man oh you gotta love it
And on top of that its getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now its everybody else thats getting hard to believe
But man oh you gotta love it
And head to toe Im Prada covered
I know your girl well just not in public
Blame the city Im a product of it
Young nigga from the city
feat 2 Chainz Big Sean
Im really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Cant get no more free Randy
Got everything I got everything
I cannot complain I cannot
I dont even know how much I really made I forgot
Its a lot fuck that nevermind what I got
Nigga dont watch that cause I
Came up thats all me
Stay true thats all me
No help thats all me
Came up thats all me
Stay true thats all me
No help thats all me
Money on my mind you should think the same
Dogging these hoes I need quarantine
In the same league but we dont ball the same
She want all the fame
I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me
I said Baby girl fall in line ok
Made a million off of denim
Fuck watch me switch it up
Walked in Ill nigga alert Ill nigga alert
You need that work I got that work got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a MercedesBenz car note
From the A to Toronto we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce this that dressing
Givenchy nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime
I touched down in 86
Knew I was a man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit nigga hated it
Damon Wayans told me dont play that shit
I get paid a lot you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
Aint no wishing over on this side
Yall dont fuck with us and we dont fuck with yall its no different over on this side
Should I listen to everybody or myself
Cause myself just told myself You the motherfuckin man you dont need no help
Cashin checks and Im bigging up my chest
Yall keep talking bout who next
But Im about how big as it gets
I swear yall just wastin yall breath
Im the light skinned Keith Sweat
Im a make it last forever
Its not your time cause I aint done yet
Look just understand that Im on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And Im on the road box office sales
Im getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
Cause if we judging off your advances
I just got paid like eight advances God damn
HOE SHUT THE fuck UP
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what Ive been through
Im finna do what I didnt do
And still waking up like the rest do
I got sexy ladies a whole Benzfull
And to them hoes Im everythang
But I still take my time
Man I guess Im just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit thats old fashioned
Nigga see what Im saying no closed caption
I paint pics see the shit
Good sex need to hit
Keep a bra on the floor
Year round like season tickets
Leave you split in the half
Smoke a half Need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch aint one
I got 99 problems getting rich aint one
Like I got trust issues
Im sorry for the people Ive pushed out
Im the type to have a bulletproof condom
And still gotta pull out
I aint a saint but I am worth it
If its one thing I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it aint workin
Oh Me Oh Me Oh my I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
Fore the end of this year Ill do King of Diamonds three more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section like its legalized
Girl you cant always have your way sometimes it be like that
They dont really fuck with you like that that aint never did me like that
I just took my time you got your shine I let you eat like that
I been taught never to loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back no more free Randy
Im blessed than a motherfucker
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucker
Niggas gettin nervous clutchin they chests like a motherfucker
Tell the truth I dont listen to ya
Cause I dont like being lied to
And that ship wont sail
And that wind wont guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talkin through the window
That was back then man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock girl
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock
She got the good good
I knock her lights out
I hate to see her go
But I love to watch her leave
But I keep her runnin back and forth
Cold as a winter day
Hot as a summers eve
Steal your heart with ease
I like the way you walkin
If your walkin my way
With all kinds of space
Ill let you be the judge
I see me with her
Cuz she know she bad
And I got her ngger
Oh baby I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the gspot

I can make your bed rock girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock
I guess its my turn
Maybe its time to put this pssy on your sideburns
He pressin me like buttons downs on a Friday night
We on my pedal bike
He on my low skirt
He on my edgar whites
He say Nicki dont stop
and I just be coming off the top as bestest
I Love ya tosha roll
I race for your love
But I cant meet you in the lobby
Girl I gotta watch my back
Cuz Im not just anybody
I seen them stand in line
Just to get beside her

You need GPS to find her
Oh that was your girl
I thought I recognized her
Oh baby I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the gspot
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock girl
I can make your bedrock

I like rollin with friends
She said Im caged in
I think her conscience is
But when that show ends
She all over my skin
She pose like its for posters
And I poke like Im suppose to
Take this photo if you for me
she said dont you ever show this
Im to loyal and to focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this she rejoiced this
She said your words gets me open
So I closed it where your clothes
Im only lovin for the moment
She aint got a man
Yeah she got her own
Well thats what your are
How I see it is how I call it
Look at how she walk
Mhm she know she bad
And I aint even fast
Oh baby I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the gspot
I can make your bed rock

YEAHH Lyrics submitted by najah
Im just so far gone
Drunk off champagne screamin in the phone
See my house is not a home fuck is goin on
Where did we go wrong
Caught up in the game and its one I cant postpone
Meaning if it rains Im the one its raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me dont forget em and I promise that I wont
Feelin so distant from everyone Ive known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Ive done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
Its only been 3 Years look at how Ive grown
Im just in my zone I call this shit the calm
Yea but Im the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it wont even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school its proven and its known
Im sittin in a chair but in the future its a throne
You know everything gone be alright I promise A
Pologize to you know to put yall in this position and vent to yall but
40 mom always say Dont ask permisson just ask forgiveness
You know so forgive me
I know you like to worry itll be better if you dont cause
And life is so insane
Look what Ive became
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that its a strain
Its a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
Its a weight thats on my chest whoever spottin me is playin
So Im liftin all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin western union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feelin guilty and ashamed
Like how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn and I could only feel his pain
Cause in memphis tennessee theres only so much to attain
So Im fillin out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me I just hope he doesnt say that shit in vain
Im why yo girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake Im the hardest one to tame
As a man Im just honest as a artist Im a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin on my brain
Yea And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I Remain
Me Yea Uh I said I call this shit the calm
But Im the furthest thing from calm
I swear Im puttin on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin on like ManLyrics submitted by Andrew
right where you see me
aint no offence about it
nah i got a decent set of manners
and a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
and i fall in love with girls caught up with superficial glamour
who dress like sarah jessica
and live like princess diana
so often they have addictions
and im the one thatll feed it
but truely youre bad enough that you dont even really need it
you can show up at the party on dirty public transit
and i guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin candids
of you and your posse partying
drinking watch you get handed
with your virgin island tans
all lookin like you just landed
i dont really understand it
im not sure im comprehending it
but these girls are having fun with whoevas money they spendin
I got to be Unstoppable
I got to be Unstoppable
and i work harder than hard workin
thats where my bar surface
therefore i act a clown
even when im laying on my back
i got a condo in miami
and my doorman is always sandy
but ive never pulled a hammy
and i got a condo in atlanta
and i always wear a bandana
and when it comes down to stuntin
you boys is just buttonin
im swinging for the fence
your girl hanging from my dick
your girl sanging too much shit
like ah loli loli pop
she say i get that pussy wetter than a designer shop
she say i get that pussy better
everybody want some mo dick mo dick
but ill be like damnnnn
all i got is one dick
I got to be Unstoppable
I got to be Unstoppable
Give me one Ill take it
Make you lose your place
Tell me III can play
So I speed up the pace
I break it break it you cant stop me
I got to be Unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable

I remember me and me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time like
What its gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didnt know much then but
I can probably tell you a lil somethin now
Mr Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and havent hollered since
So the patron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin I cant stop her
New girl trippin but I cant drop her
Cause I need somethin to balance out the fact
That its hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin at labels and they silencin you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See theres everybody else then theres one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here
I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch chrome green diamonds I call it the earth face
Im gettin ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Yall eat pedigree as ya meal
Ive been Urkel for some years
Though I rock lean snap
Its better bein this real
Its better drivin a car with the letter B in the wheel
Light sayin tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you aint gon see
In the club with a model spillin dranks on me
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
Im in the Range bumpin Keyshia Cole
Why you wanna judge me
I dont ever compare yall
I know it because Im there yall
It aint even started Im really tryna prepare yall
With or without a label man Im committed to poppin
And take over the summer
Imma meet a lot of women Imma do a lot of shoppin
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I dont take it back
Same rappers thats all in ya face sayin Drake is whack
Are checkin my availability just to make a track
Imma do it cause I know I put you through it I know I put you through it baby
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at the dinner table and say my babys famous and I knew it

And it wasnt nothin to it
Im drawin and drawin till the pen was out of fluid
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out
Id like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF
Closer to my dreams Miss Andreena Mill
I feel it in my sleep Sing it to em baby
I said Im gettin higher
And closer to my dreams
Sometimes it feels like Ill never move on
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin off of the speed at which life progress
From meetin Trey in Atlanta to doin a cameo in his video has made everything right with ex Songz
I got too many records and not enough shows
Too many rappers and not enough
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin
The gray ten drop out
Summer 05 with the gray Benz drop out
On my Craig David shit the awful dodger
Bout to get my runon so hold the commas
Times changed now Im older mama
And these niggas aint solid they fold in drama
And thats the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
Im back off of hiatus
Im gettin cake off of my latest
Respected in any city that I roam
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Closer to my dreams
I feel it in my sleep
I said Im gettin higher
And closer to my dreams
Sometimes it feels like Ill never move on
Closer to my dreamsLyrics submitted by ashley
We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon
And nothing was the same
Watch me going out of the way
When I shouldve went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We aint spoke in so long probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that aint too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something
Come thru come thru come thru come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru
Come thru come thru come thru come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru
Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken
Told my girl to order in I need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hookup they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove you do the dishes ya know
Rap game crack game aint that different ya know
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that noila got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when its late
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something
Come thru come thru come thru come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru
Come thru come thru come thru come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru
Why has it been so long Why has it been so long
Why has it been Why has it been
Who you been crying to Who you been flying to
Whose bed are you sleeping in Someones been hiding you

Fantasizin and fistin and switchin up positions
Do you mind if we just menage just a little
Mo City trip Mo City trip right now
Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for
Theres a room full of niggas
What you following me for
This aint no fucking singalong
So girl what you singing for
Its cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20 keep the bar rolling
Fake IDs in the trash we going
Straight to the top rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned rainbows flowing
Lightskinned chick first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland why Cause
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess well never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really I think I like who Im becoming
Theres times where I might do it just to do it like its nothing
Theres times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones thatll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story and made history
Tell them Imma need reservations for 20
Ive never really been one for the preservation of money nah
Much rather spend it all while Im breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in I know
Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
If you broadcast swag nigga we the news in your city

When a good thing goes bad its not the end of the world
Its just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And shes the reason it happened but shes overreacting
And its all because she dont want things to change
So cry if you need to but I cant stay to watch you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to but I cant stay to hold you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to but I cant stay to hear you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Cause youll say you love me and Ill end up lying
And say I love you too
But I need someone different
You know it oh ho you know it
Oh ho you know it we both know it
You know it oh ho you know it
Oh ho you know it we both know it
You know it oh ho she knows it
Oh ho I know it we all know it
We live in a generation of not being in love and not being together
But we sure make it feel like were together
Cause were scared to see each other with somebody else
So cry if you need to but I cant stay to watch you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to but I cant stay to hold you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to but I cant stay to hear you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Cause youll say you love me and Ill end up lying
And say I love you too
But I need someone different
You know it oh ho you know it
Oh ho you know it we both know it
You know it oh ho you know it
Oh ho you know it we both know it
You know it oh ho she knows it
Oh ho I know it we all know it

Nail done hair done every thing done
Nails done hair done everything d
Nail done hair done every thing done
Nails done hair done everything d
You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you dont do it for the man men never notice
You just do it for yourself youre the fcking coldest
Intelligent too ooh youre my sweetheart
Ive always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together
Nail done hair done every thing done
Nails done hair done everything d
Well arent you a breath of fresh air
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller think that they aint got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking somes dcks until some millions appear
Voila you do it right he might just buy you a car
Unless you play these suckers just like BoB play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say Im buying you declining I think thats kinda bizarre
Independant with the demeanor of an RnB singer
Make it rain finger check
Closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags
Alexander McQueen Prada Gucci Chanel
DG BCBG Versace Louie and BeBe
Ya dont need it greedy or easy as these other breezys
Who fck for bowls of baked ziti
Nail done hair done every thing done

Nails done hair done everything done
Atlanta girls let me see your hands
Wave em at the btches hating on you with their friends
Let em know everything big
Nails done hairs done everything big
And my NY girls let me see your hands
Wave em at the btches hating on you with their friends
Let em know everything big
Nails done hairs done everything big
Let me see your hands
Wave em at the btches hating on you with their friends
Let em know everything big
Nails done hairs done everything big
Let me see your hands
Wave em at the btches hating on you with their friends
Let em know everything big

Devil in a tight dress
Girl you a killer and aint nobody realer
And aint nobody realer go go go go go
Go go go go go go
Go go go go go go
Uh 5 and a half in boys
Ass is off the hook
Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
But never late is better
They tell me time is money well well spend it together
You just lead the way
We go to dinner you dont even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I aint never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas
And enough money to loan us a little something extra
Should we ever need it
If it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it

Nails done hair done everything d

This is why I do this shit
I think they call this uhm venting
No auto tune but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like i hit a vein
I hope you know that yall the reason i have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for one meal
Equal opportunities rapping that shit is unreal
That aint how it works
That aint that how it goes
And I been getting high to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer to balance out my flows
But I never share my thoughts
This is all a nigga knows
And every time I try it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
And I would be performing just as long as Im alive
So every word I utter will be mine
Look me in my eyes
Please dont be scared of me
Please dont be scared of me
So please dont be scared of me
Please dont be scared of me
Oh oh oh oh oh uhh
I never cried when Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if my tears hold value then i would drop one for every single thing he showed us
And Ill be standing in a puddle
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
And ima keep it honest
Am so tired of being subtle
Its just me Forty O and nich standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned about they profit from this million dollar scheme
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your family this shit aint what it seems
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles cuz i bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open
Look me in my eyes
Please dont be scared of me
Please dont be scared of me
So please dont be scared of me
Please dont be scared of me
oh oh oh oh oh uhh
Welcome to my realest year
I swear we making a killah here
I should be on top of the world here just chillen here
But its funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when your there sometimes the shit dont feel the same
And plus things are just so real at home
People think Ive changed just because my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere so im never actually am alone i just always feel alone
I think im scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those
Every girl I meet thinks im fucking groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed
All my old friends think i got a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I do smile
I guess that mean they come few and far between
Even though am living out what you would call adream
And my uncle aint even messaging me
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
I hope this isnt one of those forever things
Its funny how money can change everything
Look me in my eyes
Please dont be scared of me
Please dont be scared of me
So please dont be scared of me
Please dont be scared of me

And I feel it taking over
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and

I bet if i give all my love then

I doubt you’ll find another
Ill be the one that you remember

I better find your love and

I better find your love and

I bet if i give all my love then
nothings gonna tear us apart

you hear but you don’t listen
and get what you been missing
too many times I’ve been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I’m done waiting there’s nothing left to do
but give all I have to you and
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and

Money just changed everything I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Lookin down from the top and its crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame you know I respect the blatant sht
When I hear talkin I just dont know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me Im slowly embracing it
Doesnt come natural bear with me it could take a bit
Yeah and my dreams who Im racing with
You can see Im pacin it so that Im always chasin it
Wayne put me right here thats who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah this life is something I would die for
Octobers Own but its lookin like July 4th
But I just wish theyd let you try it first
This time Im really goin off fireworks
When I go off like July 4th
feels like a fire Got to go higher
Its your revelation my sweet celebration
light me like a rocket cause cant nothing stop it
all I see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
I got this one girl you know in my life
so I say in this song I say
Im just such a gentleman
you should give it up for me
look at how Im placing al my napkins and my cutlery
I can tell it wasnt love I just thought you fck with me
who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me
yeh I kept my wits about me luckilly
what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
and you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
but I was curious and Ill never forget it baby
you coulda been the one but it wasnt that serious
their was smoke in the air before now its me cleaing it
that felt good all and all I learned a lesson from it though
you never see it coming you just get to see it go
yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
now I can see it in her eyes
Everything the same but it feels different
my dad called me up knowing that I still listen
and hes still got his foot out guilt trippin
Its been years though I just learn to deal with it
For real me and my Realtor we built up a better rapport
got my mother in a place with some better decor
she searched the entire city I let her explore
ant now shes sayin shes more lonely than every before
How many of our parents marriages lasted
I was only 5 I bet I barely reacted
Im flying back home for the heritage classic
searching for that feeling tell me where is the magic
lets stay together til were ghosts
I want to witness love Ive never seen it close
yeah but I guess I gotta find it first thats why Im really going off Fireworks
It may not mean nothing to yall
but understand nothing was done for me
so I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine ever mine ever mine
Im shutting shit down at the mall
and telling that girl she the one for me
and I aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine ever mine ever mine
like a sprained ankle boy I aint nothin to play with
it started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
and your city faded off to brown Nino
she insists she got more class we know
swimming in the money come and find me Nemo
if you was at the club you know i bald Kimo
drop the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
whod have thought a country rock tour would be the outcome
labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
everybody got a deal I did it without one
yeah nigga im about my business
killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
if you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness
it may not mean nothing to yall
but understand nothing was done for me
so I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine ever mine ever mine
Im shutting shit down at the mall
and telling that girl she the one for me
and i aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine ever mine ever mine
I used to have hood dreams
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
just so I can make it rain all spring
yall seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
you can call it statutory
when a nigga blow up they can build statues of me
old money Benjamin Button whaat nuttin
now superbad chicks giving me macLovin
you would think I ran the world like Michelles husband
you would think these niggas know me when they really doesnt
like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasnt
youre such a fucking loser
you need to go to class Bueller
trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
remember she had a bad hip like a fanny pack
chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
all the way in Hollywood and i cant even act
they pull their cameras out and Goddamn they snap
I used to want this day forever yall can have it back
it may not mean nothing to yall
but understand nothing was done for me
so I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine ever mine ever mine
Im shutting shit down at the mall
and telling that girl she the one for me
and i aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine ever mine ever mine
Ok Hello its da martian
I want this shit forever
wake up and smell the Garden
step up to the target
if I had one guess than i guess im just New Orleans
and i will never stop like Im running from the cops
hop up in my car and tow my chauffeur to the top
life is like a fucking roller coaster then it drops
but what should i scream for this is my theme park
my mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
pistol on my side you dont wanna hear that thing talk
let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne thats what they got to say or mention
Im like Nevada in the middle of the summer
Im resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
shhh my foots sleeping on the gas
no brake pass no such thing as last
It may not mean nothing to yall
but understand nothing was done for me
so I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine ever mine ever mine
Im shutting shit down at the mall
and telling that girl she the one for me
and i aint even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine ever mine ever mine
There they go back in stadiums
as Shady spits his flow
nuts they go macadamia they go so ballistic woah
we can make them look like bosos
hes wondering if he should spit his slow
fuck no go for broke
his cup just runneth over oh no
he aint had a robust like this since the last time he overdosed
theyve been waiting patiently for Pinnochio to poke his nose
back into the game and they know
rap will never be the same as before
bashing in the brains of these hoes
and establishing a name as he goes
the passion and the flame is ignited
you cant put it out once we light it
this shit is exactly what the fuck im talking about when we riot
you dealin with a few true villains
whose stayin inside of the booth truth spillin
and spit true feelings till our tooth fillings come flying
up out of our mouths
payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste
when I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass
so loud that it shakes the place
Im hannibal lecter so just in case your thinking of saving face
you aint gonna have no face to save by the time im through with this place
It may not mean nothing to yall
but understand nothing was done for me

I might be too strung out on compliments
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long Im floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin Im back Id agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off ooh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up well whered I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt cause Im just mobbin like that
You know good and well that you dont want a problem like that
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that
No dont do itaye please dont do itaye cause one of us goes in
And we all go through it
Drizzy got the money so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers I aint even gotta say it
Thats just something they know
They know they know they know
They know they know they know
They know they know they know
That the real is on the rise
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now its something they know
They know they know they know
Yeah I be yelling out money over everything money on my mind
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize it happened over time
She says they missed the old drake girl dont tempt me
If they dont get it theyll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you suppose to do
Im like why I gotta be all that but still I cant deny the fact that its true
Listen to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children
And thats who you thinking is bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me myself and all my millions
You know the game even got it like that
You gone hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this it isnt just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it I aint even gotta say it they know
They know they know they know
They know they know they know
They know they know they know
That the real is on the rise
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now its something they know

You used to call me on my you used to you used to

Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city you
Started wearing less and goin out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin with some girls Ive never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city you you you
You and me we just dont get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you dont belong
Ever since I left the city you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages on your passport
Hanging with some girls Ive never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days all I do is
Wonder if you bendin over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin nasty for someone else
You dont need no one else
You dont need nobody else no
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now youre someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling

Yo you cheesed me dog
Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it’s dark out
To see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss ya
Shit’ll come back around and get ya
Crazy like all my niggas
Crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you
Remember when you had to take the BAR exam
I drove in the snow for you
You probably don’t remember half the shit a nigga did for you
Ya you ain’t really fuck with me way back then girl
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
Aw you thought you had it all figured out back then girl
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl
Always been daddy’s little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain’t even say thank you
Left from back when I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like “who’s this”
I be like “me girl”
You be like “oh word true shit”
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it
Yeah made me feel I have it like that
Like I was average like that
Started drinking way more than I used to
People form habits like that girl
Yeah man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I’m not even Christian I still went to church that year
Guess I just had to pretend that year
I ain’t even see my friends that year
Places that I should’ve been
You ain’t really fuck with me way back then
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
Aw you thought you had it all figured out back then girl
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl
Gotta do what I gotta do
All my exes live in Texas like Im George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go told them dont even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only hello or happy belated
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And thats when she text me and told me she prayed it
And thats when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texting I told her Im faded
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though its fucked up girl Im still fucking wit ya
Damn is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
Theres albums to drop theres liquor involved
Theres stories to tell we been through it all
Get the fuck up out my dressing room confusing me with questions like
Do you love this shit
Are you high right now
Do you ever get nervous
I heard you fucked your girl is it true
You getting money You think them niggas you with is with you
And I say Hell yeah
And we say Hell yeah
So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like aint no curfew bitch if you wave then I will surf you
I flew jet she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session she came over I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did but that was last month and now shes texting me asking for closure
Damn she say this shit gon catch up to me I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasnt married
Promises I hope I never break em
Met a female dragon had a fire conversation
But interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like
Gotta do what I gotta do
All my exes live in Texas like Im George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go told them dont even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only hello or happy belated
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And thats when she text me and told me she prayed it
And thats when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texting I told her Im faded
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though its fucked up girl Im still fucking wit ya
Damn is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
Theres albums to drop theres liquor involved
Theres stories to tell we been through it all
Get the fuck up out my dressing room confusing me with questions like
Do you love this shit
Are you high right now
Do you ever get nervous
I heard you fucked your girl is it true
You getting money You think them niggas you with is with you
And I say Hell yeah
And we say Hell yeah
So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like aint no curfew bitch if you wave then I will surf you
I flew jet she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session she came over I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did but that was last month and now shes texting me asking for closure

Put a bib on me
Im just like a baby drooling over you
These days Im letting God handle all things above me
The things I cant change are the reasons you love me
Listen you can hear them calling my name
Im all over the place I cant sit in one place
Im not ashamed at all
Still findin myself let alone a soul mate Im just sayin
Feel like we one and the same our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin about on your timeline
Thats cuttin all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin about on your timeline
Thats cuttin all into my time with you
She said youre my everything
I love you through everything
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything this a forever thing
Hate that I treated like its a whatever thing
Trust me girl this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle she from the jungle
I take somebody elses car drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me this shit is everything
Dont know where we stand I used to hit you bout everything
Are we still good Are we still good
Are we still good Are we still good
If I need to talk are you around
Are you down for the cause
Are you down Are you down Are you down
Are you down for the cause
Are you down Are you down Are you down
Are you down for the cause
You still down You still down You still down
These days these new girls they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They cant decide they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and its out of service
Who can I call for your information
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that weve done
Are we still good Are we still good
Are we still good Are we still good
Things been so crazy and hected
I should of have got back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
Its probably better any how
So if you gotta go
If theres anythin I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you looking for a purpose
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now Im all singing karaoke further than I ever been
So if you gotta go
If theres anyway I can help
That the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner
And tells me my life is to much and moves to atlanta
Damn of all the places you could go
I just thought you would choose some where that had somebody that you know
Im always up to late
I worry bout you there alone in a place you call your home warm nights and cold patron
I hope you dont get known for nothing crazy cause no man wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest but the first cut is the deepest
I tryed to keep us together you was busy keeping secrets
Secrets you would tell everybody but me
Dont be fooled by the money
Im still just young and unlucky
Im suprise you couldnt tell
I was only trying to get ahead x2
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And your looking for a purpose
I was only trying to get ahead x2
But the spotlight makes you nervousLyrics submitted by kari
Hol it Hol it Hol it Hol it Hol it
Yall sleepin in the streets
Yeah this that Oliver 40 Niko shit man 15 Fort York shit ya know

Countin money you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari then I swerve
I want that Bugatti just to hurt
I aint rockin my jewelry thats on purpose
Niggas want my spot and dont deserve it
I dont like how serious they take themselves
Ive always been me I guess I know myself
Shakiness man I dont have no time for that
My city too turnt up Ill take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
Thats been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin Girbraud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped it was polos and backpacks
Thats when Ethan was pushin a Subaru hatchback
Man Im talkin way before hashtags
I was runnin through the 6 with my woes
Yeah I was runnin through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
Runnin through the 6 with my woes

Yeah but you know how that shit go
They so irrational they dont wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up woah
My nigga Jibba he whip it I ride in the passenger
Im way up I stay up Im two up Im three up

Like 247 thats where my life took me

I dont know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring
Bank account statements just look like Im ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga thats talkin that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum I looked at my wrist and its already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one that you should worry about
I dont know who youre referring to who is this nigga you heard about
Someone just talking that bullshit someone just gave you the runaround
Niggas downplaying the money but thats what you do when the money down
I dont waste time putting money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the making its all for the city
You know I come right every summer Cash Money Records forever
Im always big timing bitch I came up right under Stunna
Jealousy in the air tonight I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready its real I dont know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck I said Girl thats all that we do
Okay now youre talking my language
Now youre talking my language
Now youre talking my language
Now youre talking my language
Been ready its real I dont know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck I said Girl thats all that we do
Im about to roll one and light it and fuck it man no ones invited
I got to kill off the weak shit thats got all you niggas excited
I cant even listen you whylin Id much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians I do
People are funny you dont even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed it could all be so simple
Talkin that shit with your back to me just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Cant even drive with the top off
Been workin so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and thats word to Stunna
Jealousy in the air tonight I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready its real I dont know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck I said Girl thats all that we do
Okay now youre talking my language
Now youre talking my language
Now youre talking my language
Now youre talking my language
Been ready its real I dont know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck I said Girl thats all that we do
Big time sunshine tote nines
Bust mines flatline hard grind
High life stay fly as jet time
Every time you see a nigga
Every time you see a nigga
Swag on head to feet nigga
I might just bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and thats word to Stunna

When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back back

If I die all I know is Im a mothafuckin legend
Its too late for my city Im the youngest nigga reppin
Oh my God oh my God
If I die Im a legend
Oh my God oh my God
If I die Im a legend
Im up first Im on tour got a girl she from the South
Used to work used to dance in Texas now she clean the house
Everyday I was strugglin to learn what lifes about
Money taught me Spanish make it andale
Way up north packed in Honda cars
They ont know who we are
Fuck em all they only pussy niggas shootin at the star
Right or wrong Imma write my wrongs
They cant live this long
You dont know where youre gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong
Why do I feel like the only one
Why do I feel like you owe me one
6 GOD Im the holy one
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin different now
And I I just cant pretend
Seen too much its so hard for me to let new people in
I cant change this shit set in stone
They cant live this long
You dont know where youre gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong
Ive been up for 4 days
Dirty and clean I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes chauffeurs and low fades
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age
They always tell me nobodys working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off man its probably true
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying
Im just here making all the music that they party to
But party on party on all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
Ive grown tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers they aint even need a campfire
Uhh but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park
Stuntin hard in his yellow Goose
Yeah but Im a mafuckin missed target
But a target nonetheless and I just started
Was that directed at moi It cant be
They must be talking to themselves hoes hands free
Yeah and Im just filling up this daily planner
Gettin busy cause Im a star no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends Kelsey Grammar
Yeah thats what life becomes when youre doing you
Welcome to Hollywood dont let this town ruin you
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin you
Just know that she gon tell another nigga when she through wit you
Dont get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong
Yeah I gotta feel alive even if it kills me
I promise to always give you me the real me
Id be caught in this life
Lets celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Hey Guru tell hom to go to open that Ace right there
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
Im gon make this go
Owww hoes turn they heads like owls
Im the man of the hour
Triple entendre dont even ask me how
Con Edison flow Im connected to a higher power
Bright lifed make your whole city light up
A trillionwatt light bulb when Im in the nightclub
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight cause the satellite was crispy
Uh Yall can miss me with that money talk
The smart moneys on Hov fuck what the dummies talk
I dont do too much blogging
I just run the town I dont do too much jogging
Unh I aint got a scar yet
Cause you fuckin around with me and my dogs is farfetched
Drake here is how they gon come at you
Will silly raps for you tryin to distract you
In disguise in the form of a favor
The Barzini me watch for the traitors
Unh I done seen it all done it all
Thats why none of these dumbdumbs could dun him off
The summers ours the winter too
Top down in the winter thats what winners do
And to these niggas Im like Windows 7
You let em tell it they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
Im not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was cool as The Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry mama I promised it wouldnt change me
But I wouldve went insane had I remained the same me
All I got is this money thisll do
Id be caught in this life
Lets celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon make this bitch light up
Wait until the sun goes down

Ballin out we keep the cash on deck
Lamborghini and the Bentleys on the Vset
Louie lens iced out with the black diamonds
Car of the year Ferrari the new Spider

Fully loaded automatic 6 Benz
Candy paint foreign lights with my btch in
Born hustlin too big ngga to strive me up

but I really can’t complain everything is kosher
two thumbs up ebert and roeper
I really can’t see the end getting any closer
but I’ll probably still be the man when everything is over
so I’m riding through the city with my high beams on
can you see me can you see me get your visine on
y’all just do not fit the picture
if you thinking Imma quit before I die dream on
man they treat me like a legend
am I really this cold
I’m really too young to be felling this old
it’s about time you admit it who you kidding man
nobody’s ever done it like I did it
How Im feeling it doesnt matter
Cause you know Im okay
Instead I ask myself why do you hurt me
When you know you know Im the same
I know I know that you love me baby
Time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body
I think I killed everybody in the game last year man
Fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
Fck it I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays its six figures when they tax me
Oh well I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls let the lights dim sum
Shots came I dont know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from
Yeah you know me well nigga yeah
I mean you aint the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the pssy but Im just playing the field nigga yea
Are these people really discussing my career again
Asking if Ill be going platinum in a year again
Dont I got the shit the world wanna hear again
Dont Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in
Man all of your flows bore me paint drying
And I dont ever be trippin off of what aint mine
And I be hearing sht you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time yea
Its been that way from the beginning I just been playing I aint even notice that I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
I know I know that you love me baby
The time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body
You say Im old news where who the new star
Cause if Im going anyway its probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the states
Used half of the money to beat my brothers case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas thats doing deadtime
And shout out to the bitches there when its bedtime
And fck you to the niggas that thinks its there time yea
Dont make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever gave you a star boy
Or you wanna be a mother fuckin funny guy
Dont make me break your Kevin Hart boy
You know feeling good living better
I think I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel now more than ever
My city love me like Im Mac Dre in The Bay
Second Album Im pack paving away
The backpackers are back on the band wagon like this was my comeback season back back in the day
And I met your babys mom last night
We took a picture Last night
I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And lost everything that I came with
Yea feel like Ive been here before
I still got 10 years to go ha
And this is the only sound you should fear
And these kids where crowns over here everything is alright

Youre my right hand youre my go to
Told me everything about you
I know that youre out here
And theres things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just dont love you like I do
But I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip Benz wheel
And I know you cant wait
You dream big and sleep late
You got a lot on your plate
Thats why youre always working out
You dont see anybody else
Youre like fuck it oh well
My past behind me like a pony tail
But youre my right hand youre my go to
Told me everything about you
I know that youre out here
And theres things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just dont love you like I do
Ok I know you want the Audi
I know you want to go to Maui
You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
Cause you dont trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya
Buy the things he cant afford for ya
Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you
Like the car with the strap in it
Cause now its back to business
Any more henny and youre past the limit
You told me about the picture
Now you have to send it
I would never put you on blast when I get it
Youre my right hand youre my go to
Told me everything about you
I know that youre out here
And theres things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just dont love you like I do
This sht was all I knew
and I did it all for you
we coulda worked it out
uhh but i guess things change
its funny how someone elses success brings pain
when ya no longer involved that person has it all
and you just stuck standing there
But Im gonna need you to say something baby
Im gonna need you to say something baby
ever since Ive been long gone
I traded in my senorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart girl its sad to see
your life is good but me and you its catastrophe
if I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied
I need a paramedic girl Im feeling paralysed
if I could choose you will always be a friend to me
the more money I made you acting like my enemy
its crazy I cant help it if you feel ashamed
lots of pressure will turn you into my diamond babe
how can something so familiar be so strange
closest friends get estranged when the status change
ahh is it my mistake think that where I am and where you at
and my whole wild is the only one that had my back
you were the perfect girl now it seems we dont match
is it the money want me to give it back
Uhh i am the topic of conversation this a celebration
lets toast to the fact that I moved out my momma basement
to a condo downtown because its all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch californication of life
you shoulda been here to kick it with me
we coulda split this whole thing up 5050
but now im at the 4040 getting btches tipsy
killing sht the ever so talented Mr Ripley
how I go from being the man that you argue with
to me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest sht
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
but Im addicted to this life its gonna be hard to quit
yeah just ask me how things are coming along
you can tell me that you never heard none of my songs
long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
cos whats a star when its most important fan is missing
Why do I feel so alone
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I dont have the heart to give these
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back but
Its hard to think of them polite flows
Mr Fano Poloto suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full
Now this shit just being lipod
Always said Id say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Showing you the basics
I cant live and hold the camera
Someone gotta tape this
I make hits unlike a bitch
Thats married I aint miss
24 hours from greatness
Dont ever forget the moment
You began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed
To pull my Phantom out
So I park about 5 houses down
She say I shouldnt have it until I have the crown
But I dont wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus
But yet Im rolling round the fuckin city like your highness
Got niggas reactin without a sinus
Cause what Im working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
They say I have fun but I cant imagine how
Cause I just seen my exgirl
Standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that Im fuckin right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear
We from a small town
Everybody talks and everybody listen
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing
Ive always been something that these labels cant buy
Especially if they tryin to take a peice of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin Tez Damn Drake fly
And he just be like Silly mother fucker I know
That was your bad
How could you pass up on em
He just take them records
And he gas up on em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on em
Oh they did Po
At least they tried to
And thats what happens
When you spitting whats inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you
However they decide to nahh
But Forty told me to do me
And dont listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me would
Mean that theres a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest
Could of fooled me
Boy in my city Im da 23
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and its not because Im lazy
Im just not the social type
And campus life is crazy understand
I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit
Im gettin better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said cause this Ye shit you better kill
And I think this got this Making of a Legend feel
Problem with these other niggas they
Yea thats all I can sayLyrics submitted by Raevin
I can see it in your eyes youre angry
Regret got sht on what youre feeling now
Mad cause he aint like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take all the love that we made
Now youre trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
Its a shame you didnt keep it Alicia Katia
I know that you gon hear this Im the man
Yeah I said it Btch Im the man
The way you walk thats me
The way you talk thats me
The way youve got your hair up did you forget thats me
And the voice in the speaker right now thats me
And the voice in the mirror thats me
Cant you see that I made it Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are then I made it
And youre wasted with your ladies
Yeah Im the reason that you always getting faded
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
A shot for meA shot for me
Girl I cant lie I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated for the record back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl I dont get you
She says I know you changed I never see you
Cause youre always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that were from just kinda ruined things
Its such a small place not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of Mr Perfect
I could tell that you been crying all night drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness hope that you recover uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And its worse because you know that I deserve it
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
A shot for meA shot for me

Trouble neglect you angels protect you
And heaven accept youLyrics submitted by wu xu

Oh yeah Trey I fucking feel you
They be staring at the money like its unfamiliar
To me theres nothings realer
Just enough to solve your problems
Too much would kill ya
I always come right back here
The young spit it and everybody in rap fear
A lot of yall still sounding like last year
The game needs change and Im the motherfucking cashier
Aint the limes in my head
Take my verses too serious ya hate me
Cause Im the one to paint a vivid picture no HD
Thats why I strive for it
Diss me and youll never hear a reply for it
Any awards show or party Ill get fly for it
I know whats coming I just hope Im alive for it
I want things to go my way
But as of late a lot of shit been going sideways
And my mother tried to runaway from home
But I left somethin in the car so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me so I cried too
And my stomach was soaking wet
And 48 hours all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn my reality just set in
And even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things
Hoping I never have to fit in
So trying to keep up with my programs is like a dead end
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show
And life change for us every single week
But I know this aint the peak though
Wise words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand
This lost boy got fly without peter pan
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man
In person I am everything and more
Im everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside Im treading waters steady trying to swim ashore
Im on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store
Just call me shop and bag drizzy
And call me Mrdamn he aint coping that is he
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy
While this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy
Im a kill it I promise this I know you mad
Ive always treated my city like some shoulder pads
To big homie use a flash if you must
And I swear I aint asking for much
Its like I know what I got to say
I just dont know how to say it to you
Long bread I dont eat shortcake
Miss a woman like I cant miss cartdates
But shes not in this portrait
Lifes fine but I don not portray
Im on the other side but it is a short gate
I dont want the glow
I want the glow ray
And Im a fuck the world
But this is just foreplay
Bring her on to cowshit
Havent met a smell thats stinkier than shit
So high up I got birds in the condo
Aint that a female dog
Ask her who I am to her
Weezy baby go hard
No further details boyLyrics submitted by Darold
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All in the same thing
To do what you couldnt do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kais kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
I’m just a sicko a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop you was staying right below me nigga
We must have played it a hundred times you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try to say it louder nigga
Trust we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit ‘em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
MoG with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those the strings that you can’t pull
Yeah and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source
Fuck with all the word of mouth
Golden State running practice at my house
Nigga what am I about
You gon’ really feel it now
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little
All your exes know I like my O’s with a V in the middle
You would love it if I went away or didn’t say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself
You was never gang gang gang gang you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there now we done all grown up
But I’m better off anyway y’all never gon’ finish Drake
Say you seeing ‘bout it when you see me man y’all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said said things that you shouldn’t say
We even gave you the whole money play and yall still broke to this day
“Oh it’s your time now” yeah that’s what everybody say
I used to wanna be on RocAFella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA Now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man Ye’s pool is nice mines just big is what I’m saying
I’m that nigga’s what I’m saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here
I’m not even from around here
Six six six six six soon as I’m back in the city they throw a parade
I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne
Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave
Yeah so trust me they’ll be out here…
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All in the same thing
They don’t want us to have a bigger pool than Kanye
I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost
I’ve asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn’t change
And I still feel the same
Whats a life with no fun please don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine you’ve had yours we both know
We know they don’t get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can’t sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little tasteah
Pushing me away so I give her spaceah
Dealing with a heart that I didn’t break
I’ll be there for you I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don’t know
Trying to run from that say you’re done with that
On your face girl it just don’t show
When you’re ready just say you’re ready
When all the baggage just ain’t as heavy
And the partys over just don’t forget me
We’ll change the pace and well just go slow
You won’t ever have to worry
You won’t ever have to hide
Youve seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes
Cause if you let me here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost
It’s my birthday Ill get high if I want to
Can’t deny that I want you but Ill lie if I have to
Cause you don’t say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do you do
One time been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you’re following your heart
Cause your mind don’t control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine you’ve had yours we both know
We know you hate being alone
You ain’t the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somethin’ to save you
Dont tell me I dont care
If you hurt I dont tell you
You dont care if youre true
Dont tell me I dont care
If you hurt I dont tell you
You dont care if youre true
I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost Lyrics submitted by Caitlyn Smith

Then it goes young young young young YOUNG
Bust that pussy open then I tell her bring it back
Make sure you dont fall in love
Cause I dont have the time for that
Only thing I chase is money if you tell me where its at
When you rich there is a certain type of woman you attract
I say I be on some G shit I be on some G shit
Check some other niggaz for that louis shopping spree shit
Not me bitch I said not me bitch
And it goes young young young young YOUNG

I’m just so far gone
See my house is not a home
Where did we go wrong
Caught up in the game
And its one I can’t post pone
I’m the one its raining on
With my diamond chain’s on
That I spray with my cologne
And tell me don’t forget them
And I promise that I won’t
Feeling so distant from everyone I’ve known
I think I would need a clone
I done more for this city
Than these rappers that have blown
Its only been 3 years
Look at how I’ve grown
I’m just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
And I swear my word is bond
And it wont even take that long
You can see it in my face
Even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school
Its proven and its known
I’m sittin’ in a chair
But in the future it’s a throne
I know you like to worry
It’d be better if you don’t
Everything gone be all right
I apologize to you know
Put y’all in this position
Don’t ask permission just ask forgiveness you know
And life is so insane
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a vantage you can gain
They love it when you smile
Unaware that it’s a strain
It’s a curse you gotta live with
When you’re born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say you’re the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Terrence in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It’s a weight that’s on my chest
Who ever spottin’ me is playin’
So I’m liftin’ all alone
Trynin’ not to get a sprain
Hopin’ Western Junior doin’ currency exchange
It got me feeling guilty and ashamed
I had a rolls and I went and got a range
And he payin’ for his cigarettes
With some dollars and some change
And I can only feel his pain
There is only so much to attain
So I’m fillin’ out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me
I just hope he doesn’t say that shit in vain
I’m why your girls heart is in a slain
I’m the hardest one to tame
As a man I’m just honest
As an artist I’m a king
With my own set of problems
That be sittin’ on my brain
And see this is the thang
What they viewin’ as braggin’
Is the way that I maintain
While starin’ out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I remain
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
That’s why I’m putting on
They always wanna ask what type of act that you putting on
Like… Damn Lyrics submitted by Marjorie
Its not me and you
Its not me its you
Your reckless and you know it
They dont love you like I do
Say youre moving over like guess thats just the motion
I guess thats just the motion oooh x4
I dont have a fuck to give
I been moving state to state
In my leather and my Tims
And my dog Chubby Chubb
Thats my nigga from the way
On the East side of the city
Cause they want me on their song
Its like every time I touch it
I can never do no wrong
When they need a favor from ya man they dont leave you alone
But I guess thats just the motion
And your phone doesnt ring when they got everything
I guess thats just the motion oooh x2
Looking back on it at least my pride is in tact
Cause we said no strings attached
And I still got tied up in that
Every thing that I write is either for her or about her
So Im with her even when Im here without her
The girl that I want to save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that want to be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Dont even know how to help
But I guess thats just the motion
Yeah shell probably come around soon as I settle down
I guess thats just the motion ooh x10
Yesterday when we were getting high
you were invited you woulda liked it
uh uh ah I know you all too well
we said that we can kiss the past goodbye
theres no way to fight it
you can stay shawty but here I go
Should I spend the weekend in Vegas
Im busy living the moment not taking pictures to save it
I mean how could I forget
my memories never faded I cant relate to these haters
my enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
the game needed life I put my heart in it
I blew myself up Im on some martyr sht
carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship
yeah Im 23 with a money tree
growing more too I just planted 100 seeds
Its ironic cause my mother was a florist and thats how she met my pops
and now my garden is enormous its happening penny lane
I said its happening Penny Lane
just like you said I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead
uh ahh thats word to the millions that they putting up
Im trying to do better than good enough
What am I afraid of
this is what dreams are supposed to made of
the people I dont have time to hang with
always look at me and say the same sht
You promised me you would never change
You promised me you would never change
Am I wrong for making light of my situation
clap on when 40 got something for me to snap on
NOw that Im on I dont want to worry about getting back on
Im just trying to stay on
get my fcking buffett on
I heard they jsut moved my grandmother to a nursing home
and Ill be acting like I dont know how to work a phone
but hit redial youll see that I just called some chick I met at the mall
that I barely know at all and
plus this women that I mess with unprotected txt us saying she wish she woulda kept it
the one Im laying next to just looked over and read it
I couldnt tell you where the fck head is
Im holding on by a thread its like Im high right now
the guy right now and you can tell by looking at my eyes right now
that nothing really comes as a surprise right now
cause we having the time of our lives right now
I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
the other day Lissa told me she missed the old me
which made me question when I went missing
and when I start treating my friends different
maybe it was the fast pace switch up or the 2 guns in my face during the stick up
maybe cause I girl I fcking trusted set the whole sht up
but a fact I havent seen em since they locked big Rich up
I know the same time Im quick to forget
bout to roll me a blunt with my list of regrets
burn it al burn it all Im starting it fresh
cause half the itme I got it right I probably guessed
did I just trade free time for camera time
will I blow all of this money baby hammertime
yeah I just need some closure aint no turning back for me
Im in it till its overLyrics submitted by John
Bridge over troubled water ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn’t be driving it just got so much harder
Can’t even see straight I can’t even see straight
Oh fuck with me I buy the shots
Live a little cause niggas die a lot and lie a lot
But I’m the truth that’s right I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain’t gotta die to get to heaven
You Girl you right there you look like you like this shit
How’d I know how’d I know That’s me on some psychic shit
I could tell a lie if you asking me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rappin’ bitches rappin’ bitches bitches
And rappin’ rappin’ an’ bitches until all of us switches
I swear it’s been two years since somebody ask me who I was
I’m the greatest man I said that before I knew I was
That’s whats important what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing “walking like a man finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket I’m a uptown nigga ah”
With fame on my mind my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days Acura days
I was a cold dude I’m getting back to my ways
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave I’m an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I’m down to spend whatever lately I’ve been on a roll
And I do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city UGK fuck these other niggas
Sometimes I need that romance sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper thats gon’ tell me that she don’t dance
Tell me lies make it sound good make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things that’s all I’m really good for
Memphis Tennessee no see I start to go deep back
In Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and EMack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin’ furs like its snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that’s the shit that she like
So why am I a classic this is who I’m trying to be like
So I drop out lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turnin’ papers in won’t get me paid
If I don’t nothing I’mma ball
I’m countin all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah I need that making major changes to the life I’m living
I had no choice I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days Acura days
I was a cold dude I’m getting back to my ways
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave I’m an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I’m down to spend whatever lately I’ve been on a roll
And I do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga

This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I havn’t slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our seperate ways
Thinking about what we had and missing you
But I aint santa I got something for these bad btches too
I mean paprazzi on me trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthafckin heart out its drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me do I ever cross your mind
Because all this sht is new to me i’m learning to behave
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save
I know that nggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed
I promise to stay the same
I’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest ngga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest
I just really hope that

I just really hope that
Im doin my thing 3x
This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say fo life yall say foever
Its hard but its fair I told that girl life hurts
The closest your gon get to this is a Pac tshirt
The names young baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I’m gon need a thug wife
Yeah I’m talking his and her firearms

Yeah I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a snickers bar
Yeah I’m talking caramel leathers
Damn right so fly in these feathers
so whats the deali young done everything in the A but fck chillin
So welcome to my life no two days the same
Like for yall to meet the love of my life her names the game

Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Lettermans Late Night

I dont get it what more can you ask for
Yeah real 6 side shit

You gotta remind em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin its behind your back
Gotta learn to line em up and then attack
They gon say your name on them airwaves
They gon hit you up right after like its only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin treasure map
And aint told no one where the fuck its at
Shout out to the Gs from the ends
We dont love no girls from the ends
Im gon hit em with the wham once again
Imma always end up as a man in the end dog
Its just apparent every year
Only see the truth when Im staring in the mirror
Lookin at myself like there it is there
Yeah like there it is there man whoo
I aint tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum dancin
Watch the way I handle it uh
Bring it to the bedroom you know that shit is candle lit
She know Im the man with it uh
With the bands like I mustve went to Clark went to Hampton
I aint playin with it
I aint felt the pressure in a little while
Its gonna take some getting used to
Floatin all through the city with the windows down
Puttin on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
Its gon take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They dont love you like they used to man
Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance never needed nothin

Real quick man you couldnt have hated that
Lets be real nigga you couldnt have made it that
Woah dance our dance watch me dance

After this drop I got new demands
Cant meet the terms keep it movin then

So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves Im home now
Ill tell em link up at the valley at the Hazy
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy
When you get to where the fuck Im at
You gotta remind em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I aint never spent
When they say youre too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind em about where Im from
Not about where Im going about where Ive gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy do I smell beef Mmmm pheromones
Got a fuckin halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five but still remember the drought in 87
Lord tell em bitches I aint got no times to play games with em
I aint got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I got mind control over Deebo
And when my bloods start shootin thats Broll bitch
Lets just let bygones be bygones okay
Lets just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin like a damn cyborg weighin 224
Oh man these boys dont even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin to This an album
Yea we could have we could have sold it to you for 1799
Or 2999 with the shirt buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together
Motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about dont ask me no more motherfucking questions
We aint doing no interview
Been a minute since weve slept together
Ive been thinkin about everything
I dont know if its because Im lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night girl Im lonely
Ill admit it if you just keep quiet girl Im lonely
That shit ain’t my fault girl cause Im lonely
Aint no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy little bit of Henny
Im running on empty Im lonely
When I’m lonely when I’m lonely
Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebody’s house that you didn’t buy
You’re young yeah have fun girl but I hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it I’m not here to judge
Fuck it I’m not here to love everything you did to ball
Fuck it Im just glad you called
Ring ring ring what a thing
Ring ring ring school bell I ring
You and I got options bae
This shit ain’t my fault
Mothafucka never loved us fucka never loved us
You aint know now you know now still at it scrub Js with a toothbrush

But your shit is like the police asking us questions nigga we dont know shit
Flexing Nigga Im just flexing
Nigga never loved us do it look like we stressing
Look at you look at you and look at you aww Im glad that they chose us
Cause man its a mission tryna fight to the finish just to see if Im finished
On my worst behavior no They used to never want to hear us
Remember Mothafucka never loved us Remember Mothafucka

Mothafuckas never loved us Man mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us Worst behavior
Hold up hold my phone mothafuckas never loved us

Mothafucka never loved us so everywhere we go now full cup
Always hated the boy but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka I done grown up You know me You know me
Im liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me you owe me
Bitch you better have my money when I come for that shit like ODB
Whos hot who not Tell me who rock who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop who copped the new drop whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums doing numbers like its pop
Same old pimp Drake you know aint nothing changed
With these funny style niggas we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmothers grave
And its back to LA open the mail starin at the check
Enough to make you throw up man its gross what I net
Im with my whole set tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playing with her left
Oh where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga where your shit from I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch Im more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This aint the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 am then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting Ill forever be immortalized
Yeah back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city but Ive got to do the overtime
Gone all the time even the important times
I should let you know ahead Im coming back on my worst behavior
Hold up hold my phone they used to never want to hear us
Remember Mothafucka never loved us
Remember Mothafucka remember Worst behaviorLyrics submitted by maleiah
I just love when Im with you yeah this shit is on ten
We used to be friends girl and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and youd tell me baby its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his WuTang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it they say its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Its yours its yours its yours thats for sure thats for sure
Its yours its yours its yours thats for sure thats for sure
How you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night
If you nervous hit the lights I know we only fuckin out of spite
Cause your man dont do you right do you right I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9am in Dallas who you like baby who you like
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life it aint about who did it first
Its bout who did it right niggas lookin like Preach
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowin that its harder in the streets I know
Luckily I didnt have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I dont know whats gettin into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You aint ever worried cause hes not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lackin synergy
And fuckin with me mentally I think it’s meant to be
Paranoid always rollin with my mothafuckin boys
But you gotta understand when its yours
They dont really leave your ass with a mothafuckin choice man
Having conversations with mama man my life is a mess
Aint been returning the texts so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts them shits go straight to her phone
She worry bout me from home you know she raised me alone
She said I heard you back with you know who
I told her girl Im always back with you know who
And she like who are we kidding Youre 27 you just being you
Youre your fathers child man thank God you got some me in you
At least I always at least I always see it through
At least Im always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that theres someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it you told me shes free Thursday
And Im sure that shes an angel but she dont want this life
Maybe one day but even one day with us is a time of a life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But Im not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody confidence momma
I got no friends in this momma
I dont pretend with this momma
Ion joke with this momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it momma
Im Game of Thrones with it momma
Im Home Alone with it momma
I really hate using this tone with you momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two momma
Its just they cloning me momma
Its like Im the one they wanna be momma
I just I I cant be out here being vulnerable momma
I mean I kill em every time they do a song with me momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me momma
What more they want from me momma
Yeah this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
Dont ever take advice that was great advice
You and the six raised me right that shit saved my life
Having conversations with momma we start talkin bout dad
You know he dropping a single he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real girl he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesnt accept
But he just want our forgiveness and fuck it look how we living
Im content with this story who are we not to forgive him
At least I been to a prison at least I know what its like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy that could be part of the reason
Lets just call this shit even we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road Scarlett Road
Hangin with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit couldve gone south for me he looked out for me ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music old music soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now Im here and Im not black enough
Cause Im not acting tough
Ir making stories up bout where Im actually from
But I just roll with it momma rolling stone with it momma
Gotta be careful around rolling stones
Or anyone thats tryna throw stones at me momma
Im not condoning it momma
They will not tear nothing down I built this home for you momma
Know I dont call enough momma
I just been working with so little time for personal momma
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right that shit saved my life
