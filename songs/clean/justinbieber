Your worst enemy some time be your best friend
Perfect ain’t saying that I am

Wanna be wanna be everything I ought to be to you to you
Envy envy same thing as jealousy

Behind your back your back your back
Tryin’ to tell me that I’m just like the others
But I ain’t all bad
No no I ain’t all bad
I might make you mad so mad
My bad no I ain’t all bad

Holding on to me so tight

Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing

Dont do nothin less your hearts in it
Hearts in it hearts in it
Dont do nothin less youre all in it
All in it all in it
If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times the times you got back up woah
Youd be a billionaire in a year
Thats what you gotta think till youre there on the regular
If you got a diamond for all of your passion diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion gotta go hard yeah
Still dont condone it love is a component
Youre the only opponent gotta seize the moment
And dont do nothin less your hearts in it
Hearts in it hearts in it
Dont do nothin less youre all in it
All in it all in it
Said it wont hurt my side
Dont do nothin less youre all in it
All in it all in it
All in it all in it
Ever had a good time easy five strings
A guitar with only one string I can only play one song ooh
A simple melody simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing you know what I mean
If you got a diamond for all of your passion diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion gotta go hard yeah
Still dont condone it love is a component
Youre the only opponent gotta seize the moment

Said it wont hurt my side
Dont do nothin less youre all in it
All in it all in it
All in it all in it
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
Because I I just didnt think I wasnt good enough
And maybe if I was good at something that Id get recognition from that
But I quickly found out that I wasnt going to get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed
Because because people arent perfect
And by not being perfect you you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God its like Hes perfect and He never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from Him
Ohoh just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to shine in the light
Not just for the meanwhile for a long long time
Uhoh whenever youre not in my presence
It feels like Im missin my blessings yeah
So I sleep through the daylight stay awake all night
Til youre back again oh yeah yeah
You hit it right on the head
Only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone and I dont reply
But the next day bothers you why
Youre all that matters to me
Yeah yeah aint worried about nobody else
If it aint you Im not myself
Youre all that matters to me
Yeah yeah whats a king bed without a queen
There aint no I in team
Youre all that matters to me
Take the gas out the car it wont drive
Thats how I feel when youre not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you and only you
Uhoh Im grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
Youre the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart please believe
Youre all that matters to me
Yeah yeah aint worried about nobody else
If it aint you Im not myself
Youre all that matters to me
Yeah yeah whats a king bed without a queen
There aint no I in team

You said I come in peace so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythms on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone
You dont know what theyre like if they know that youre alive
Theyre gonna try to take away the secrets of your planets life
I know you must be upset you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen listen listen
Dont try to find your spaceship
That might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planets outside there waiting
I cant stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack backpack backpack
Before you came around I was in a rut
Didnt have a friend didnt know what it was
You taught me how to dream and how to love
Youre my best friend please listen to me
You dont know what theyre like if they know that youre alive
Theyre gonna try to take away the secrets of your planets life
I know you must be upset you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen listen listen
Dont try to find your spaceship
That might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planets outside there waiting
I cant stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack backpack backpack
Uh greetings I fell from the sky
Im from a different world I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And my flying saucer crashed Im the only one that survived
Ive only taken over this planet since Ive arrived
Im in the backpack Im ducking Men In Black
Yeah Im an alien my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy they try to capture me
When I die they gon name this planet after me
Waynes world waynes world waynes world
Dont try to find your spaceship

You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planets outside there waiting
I cant stay in your backpack forever

On our planet we dont kill one another
We dont take love for granted its a gift from the mother
In in your planet you are filled with greed and false belief
We came here to bring you peace
No I didn’t think you would let me down that easy oh no girl
And I didn’t think it was over
Like it was nothing baby
And that moment was so hard for me to breathe
‘Cause you took away the biggest part of me yeah
Never thought a love like yours could leave me all alone oh no
Like you had already made up your mind
‘Cause I was out of line oh yeah
But I didn’t think you would let me down that easy oh no girl
And I didn’t think it was over
Like it was nothing girl
It was a bad day hey yeah yeah
I know I was wrong
But you could have said “goodbye” baby
It was a bad day
It was a bad day
It was a bad day
It was a bad day
Across the ocean across the sea
Starting to forget the way you looked at me now
Over the mountains across the sky
Need to see your face I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps on the road and upside down now
I know its hard babe to sleep at night
cause everythings gonna be alright aiaiaiaight
Through the sorrow and the fights
cause everythings gonna be alright aiaiaiaight
All alone in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you oh I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms holding my heart
And everythings gonna be alright aiaiaiaight
cause everythings gonna be alright aiaiaiaight
You know that I care for you
Ill always be there for you
I promise I will stay right here yeah
I know that you want me too
Baby we can make it through anything
Cause everythings gonna be alright aiaiaiaight
Through the sorrow and the fights

Nothing if your heart didnt dream with me
Where would I be if you didnt believe

The sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And its crazy to me I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be Could be happening to me
We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by
We would be on the phone all day
Now I cant find the words to say to you
Now what Im supposed to do
Could there be a possibility
Im trying to say whats up
Cause Im made for you and you for me
Baby now is time for us
Shall I give it all together
They say were too young for love
But Im catching feelings catching feelings
In my head were already together
Im good alone but with you Im better
I just wanna see you smile
You say the word and Ill be right there
I aint never going nowhere
Im just trying to see where this can take us
Cause everything about you girl is so contagious
I think I finally got it down
Now its left to do now lets get out the mirror
And say it to her
Could there be a possibility
Im trying to say whats up
Cause Im made for you and you for me
Baby now is time for us
Shall I give it all together
They say were too young for love
But Im catching feelings catching feelings
Should I tell her how I really feel
Or should I move closer or just be still
Cause if I take a chance and I touch her hand
How do I know if she feels the same
Could there be a possibility
Im trying to say whats up
Cause Im made for you and you for me
Baby now is time for us
Shall I give it all together

But Im catching feelings catching feelings

To live by the words that you say
I don’t wanna be the same
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could be the light

Make all my wrongs right
Don’t fight fire with fire

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santas on his way
Hes loaded lots of toys and goodies for his sleigh
And every mothers child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so Im offering this simple phrase

Just a fraction of your love
And I fall in love with you
Youre the light that faced the sun
Id face a thousand years of pain
Out of all the things in life
That I could fear
The only thing that would hurt
Is if you werent here
I dont want to go back
To just being one half of the equation
You understand what Im sayin
Girl with out you Im lost
Cant face this focus at heart
Youre the common denominator oh oh ohh oh
Youre the common denominator oh yeah woah
Before your love was low
Playin girls was my high aye
We chase the game that would put
My cot in the side
Broken heart rise up to say
You and I would stand
Out of all the things in life
That I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you werent here
I dont want to go back
To just being one half of the equation
You understand what Im sayin
Girl with out you Im lost
Cant face this focus at heart
Youre the common denominator oh oh ohh oh
Youre the common denominator oh yeah woah
I cant imagine life
Every kiss that you give
It gives me heart
And to all the heart it can
Jealous females hate it
Ima hold it down for you
For you woah oh woah

Half of the equation woah woah yeah

She got a body like that
I ain’t never seen nothing like that
Like a fantasy in front of me
I think that something special is going down
That’s right I think she foreign
Think she foreign got passports
Mi amor started slow got faster
She gon’ work some more work some more
No stopping her now no stopping her now
Then she started dancing sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy lipstick on my satin sheets
What’s your nationality I wonder if there’s more of you
She’s got my attention she’s confident
Oh no no oh no no
Oh no no oh no no
And I’m down with it
Oh no no oh no no
You could tell by the way she walks in the room
She said it’s her first time
I think she might of lied
Feels so good damn and I don’t know why
I’m addicted something like a headache
Got me twisted but still I gotta have it
Explosive explosive I could still smell her perfume
It’s not hard to notice that I’m open
Hypnotized by the way she moves
Then she started dancing sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy Mona Lisa masterpiece
What’s your nationality I wonder if there’s more of you
She’s got my attention she’s confident
Oh no no oh no no
Oh no no oh no no
And I’m down with it
Oh no no oh no no

Say you love me as much as I love you yeah
Would you hurt me baby
Could you do that to me yeah
Would you lie to me baby
‘Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy
leave my heart still at the door
Oh I can’t help it I’m just selfish
There’s no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is
If I could just die in your arms
‘Cause everytime you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh but it feels so right
So baby baby baby please don’t stop girl
Oh Baby I know loving you ain’t easy
But it sure is worth a try
Ooh if there is a reason to call me a fool
‘Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules baby
If this is a lesson
Baby teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do
Just to stay right next to you
Oh I can’t help it I’m just selfish
There’s no way that I could share you
That will break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is
If I could just die in your arms
‘Cause everytime you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh but it feels so right
So baby baby baby please don’t stop girl
I can’t live without my baby
Loving you is so damn easy for me
Ain’t no need for contemplating
Promise me you won’t keep me waiting
Tell me baby I’m all that you need
If I could just die in your arms
‘Cause everytime you touch me

Oh but it feels so right
So baby baby baby please don’t stop girl
If I could die in your arms
I’mma make you believe girl
If I could baby oh
It’s what you do to me
Baby please don’t go girl
I never thought it would be easy
Cause were both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart
So we fight so we fight
Through the hurt through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
And we live and we live
And we learn and we learn
And we try and try and try and try
So its up to you
and its up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Mommy you were always somewhere
And daddy I live outta town
So tell me how i can ever be normal somehow
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me why am I in tears
So far away and now i just need you
So we fight so we fight
Through the hurt through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
And we live and we live
And we learn and we learn
And we try and try and try and try
So its up to you
and its up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
On our way back down to earth
We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now were standing and where do we go
to get to your heart
So its up to you
and its up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
On our way back down to earth

Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back despite I had some food up on my finger
Sippin eggnog with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though its kinda cold pullin out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said Lets make it hot up in the winter
I said Cool Ya know Imma deliver
Lets collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then Im headed to the studio cause aint nothing stopping how
You know we bout to turn it up and really get it poppin now

If you wanna give its the time of year
JB on the beat yeah yeah Im on the snare
Its crazy how some people say say they dont care
When theres people on the street with no food its not fair
Its about time for you to act merrily
Its about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
Cause they warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls
Not thinking theres a family out hungry and cold
Wishin wishin that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive lets change the globe

Well let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When shes around he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
Did you know that I loved you or were you not aware
Youre the smile on my face
And I aint going nowhere
Im here to make you happy Im here to see you smile
Ive been wanting to tell you this for a long while
Whos gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all oh my love
But you cant fly unless you let yourself
You cant fly unless you let yourself fall
Well I can tell youre afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you dont wanna lose
Well I dont wanna lose it either
I dont think I can stand sitting around while youre hurting babe so take my hand
Well did you know youre an angel who forgot how to fly
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
Cause I know that a piece of yous gone
Every time he done wrong Im the shoulder youre crying on
And I hope by the time that Im done with this song that I figure out
Whos gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all oh my love
But you cant fly unless you let yourself
You cant fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you cant fly unless you let your
You cant fly unless you let yourself fall
Whos gonna make you fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all oh my love
But you cant fly unless you let yourself
You cant fly unless you let yourself fall
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all oh my love
But you cant fly unless you let yourself
You cant fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
If you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you cant fly unless you let your let yourself fall Lyrics submitted by Dylan Morici

Give the first dance to me well cherish every moment
It only happens once once in a life time
If you give give the first dance to me im gon cherish
Every moment cause it only happens once once in a life
Subjected to my system reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interests our trust was in a bank
Thats where our hearts were safe
And then we got closer
Separated from my ex til we got closure
Ooh on every visit feelings got stronger
Now this is out of our hands our love is here to stay
So get used to me checking in all day
Get used to me falling through just to see your face

To pull up in the driveway
Its really coming down tonight
Youre scared that I wont make it through the storm
You should be here with me safe and warm
Ill be waiting under the mistletoe
While youre driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Trying to fight the urge to call
I could almost hear a pindrop
Cept for the clock on the wall
And Im scared that you wont make it through the storm
You should be here with me safe and warm
Ill be waiting under the mistletoe
While youre driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Im praying that you make it home tonight
So we can lay down by the fireside
Theres nothing else that I want this year
More than just to have you here
While youre driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Waiting for your head lights
To pull up in the driveway
Its really coming down tonight

Dont forget that Im human dont forget that Im real
Act like you know me but you never will
But thats one thing that I know for sure
I got to learn things learn them the hard way
Gotta see what it feels like no matter what they say
Sometimes its hard to do the right thing
When the pressures coming down like lightning

Act like you know me but you never will
But thats one thing that I know for sure
I know its hard but you know you gotta live
Theres something different in your eyes baby
You cant seem to look in mine lately
Tell me what is on your mind baby
Or Im gonna assume that somethings wrong
I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
Cause all those other women couldnt care less if I lived
And Im not really tripping
I just cant do this again
Please dont tell me your just like them
Please dont tell me your just like them
I know that its hard to trust of
But you need to trust that my love

Ended up on a crossroad
Try to figure out which way to go
Its like youre stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
Showed you how to read a map
For that long journey ahead
Said it aint never over
Oh even in the midst of doubt
Life is worth living ou ou ou ou
Life is worth living so live another day
People make mistakes doesnt mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Relationship on a ski slope
Do we have enough time to salvage this love
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart is just that cold
But its strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
When I thought it was over
God sent an angel to help us out yeah
He gave us direction showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it aint ever over
No even in the midst of doubt
Life is worth living ou ou ou ou
Life is worth living so live another day
People make mistakes doesnt mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again oh whoa oh
Life is worth living again
What Id give for my reflection
From what the world may see
They try to crucify me
I aint perfect wont deny
My reputations on the line
So Im working on a better me
Life is worth living oh yeah
Life is worth living so live another day
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again

Take her across the country I got plugs on the Visa
Cut your man off little mama you dont need him
He ain’t never seen a nigga like me
Hoppin out the Chevy stepping with the minks gold chain Mr T
In the summer in the beach with the hummer with the leather seat

Mansion out in Beverly your bitch call me your majesty
My bitch is so gorgeous I might pay her mortgage

Travel round the world like Im in orbit

For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart oh girl for goodness sake
You think Im crying oh my oh well I aint
And I didnt wanna write a song cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin on and I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job didnt see whats going on
And now I know Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didnt wanna write a song cause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care
I dont but you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin on and I think you should be somethin
I dont wanna hold back maybe you should know that
My mama dont like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And Ive been so caught up in my job didnt see whats going on
And now I know Im better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that youve made me feel small
I fell in love now I feel nothin at all
Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin
You should go and love yourself

And his arms are little bit longer than me

So the moons where I land

Im realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I dont wanna spend it with nobody else

Never thought Id take you serious
Now I need you not a moment later

And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
Dont do it to me no
I know you dont wanna talk right
Weve been on and off like the crosslights
You heard Im playin with them hoes like I golf right
When I touch you I get frostbite
Girl youre so cold so cold so cold
How we so young but livin so old
In the bed together but we sleepin solo
You supposed to me my uno Yoko
Oh no round two again
Weve been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson I got straight As
And I know its deeper than masseuses
Oh you know I eat the cookie like Im Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But its a waste of time if your waist aint on mine

The sun dont set the same as youre watching it go down with me
And I wont sleep the same unless youre waking up in here with me
Oh my heart’s a vacant house when you’re gone away it’s so empty
And love don’t make no sense when it’s empty Oh no
I’ve driven almost every car
It ain’t the same when Im without you boo
Been around a million stars
None of ‘em shine brighter than you
The sky be so dark now without you
It dont make no sense unless Im doing it with you
It dont make no sense unless Im doing it with you
Oh been around the world ain’t the same without you
It dont make no sense unless Im doing it with you
Focus ain’t the same if the picture ain’t got you in it
Emotions ain’t the same if it ain’t about you I don’t get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you oh
A million years don’t
Don’t nobody go higher than you
All of the angels must be lonely now without you woah
It don’t make sense no
It dont make no sense unless Im doing it with you
Cause I’m doing it with you baby
It dont make no sense unless Im doing it with you
I only want to hear your voice yeah
Oh been around the world ain’t the same without you
Had to find out the hard way
It don’t make sense no
It dont make no sense unless Im doing it with you
Going way up way up
It don’t make no sense unless I’m doing it with you
Way up way up way up
Yeah slow down stay up stay up stay up
It don’t make no sense unless I’m doing it with you
Time and time again I break a plan
Without you girl I ain’t the man
Could never be all I could be
Apparently you gotta know I hate that
How am I supposed to take that
Boo’d up missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up put a flame to that
Couple times you would made it back be patient
Won’t you pull up to me now I’m forever young
I don’t want to sleep unless you at home
It don’t make sense no
It dont make no sense unless Im doing it with you
No It don’t make sense
It dont make no sense unless Im doing it with you
No it don’t make sense it don’t make sense
It dont make no sense unless Im doing it with you
Thinking about what we had
It was all that we knew
Have you been drinking to take all the pain away
I wish that I could give you what you deserve
Cause nothing can ever ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do
You know theres no one I can relate to
I know we wont find a love thats so true
Theres nothing like you and me together through the storm
Theres nothing like you and me together
I gave you everything babe
Everything I had to give
Girl why would you push me away
You know Im used to making your day
But that is the past now
I guess that this is meant to be
Tell me was it worth it

Feeling like Im breathing my last breath
Feeling like Im walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears Ive wept
Look at all the promises that Ive kept
I put my heart into your hands
Heres my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
Youre not hard to reach
And you bless me with the best gift
Yeah youve given me purpose
Thinking my journeys come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends forever peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins oh would you please
Im more than grateful for the time we spent my spirits at ease
I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter when wherever I am
Youre not hard to reach
And youve given me the best gift
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way
Oh you are my everything
Oh you are my everything
I dont know if this is wrong because someone else is telling me that its wrong but I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again We werent necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions
You cant be hard on yourself for these were the cards that you were given so you have to understand that these like thats not who you are Youre trying to be the best you can be but thats all you can do If you dont give it all you got youre only cheating yourself Give it all you got but if it ends up happening it ends up happening
Thats what itsthats whats happening with me Its like God Im giving it all I got sometimes Im weak and Im gonna do it and its like Im not giving myself grace Im just like understanding thats just how it is

Our trust has been broken
I pray for us at night
Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I’d see your face again
Learnt a lot through trial and error
This time I’ll do you right
I’m missing your good intentions
I’m missing you from a distance
Hope you did the same
I know that I caused a problem
Know that I left you livid
Learned it don’t pay to lie
Cause I don’t wanna see you cry
Sayin nothin gets you nowhere fast
Imma hold it back inside
But now that I’m back around ya
Hope you feel the same
Our trust has been broken
I pray for us at night
Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I’d see your face again
Learnt a lot through trial and error
This time I’ll do you right
Im going through all the motions
Trying to find a reason
That we ended that way
Nothing in life is perfect
We’ll be changing like the seasons
That’s what they used to say
If it’s going to sleep alone at night
I don’t wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give
I’m not holdin back this time
Now that I’m back around ya
Hope you feel the same
Our trust has been broken
I pray for us at night
Grants me with a second chance
Never thought I’d see your face again
Learnt a lot through trial and error

blinked at me then I threw on my thinking cap
taker and then we can slide to Jamaica
shopping for a year or two stop in Diega
it’s obvious I’m gon sue your mommy is
we just friends so she can’t Clyde Bonnie us
fly walls down in the fly halls
come to the master suite leave every piece in the master hall
all about money tied in a know stand over there
that’s why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater Audi leather
playing the field tryna outslug Beretta
You see my baby over hit the road
Where she’s going i swear nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn’t want him to steal my love
I’m just tryin to be cool cool cool tryn’a be cool
What would you expect me to do
I’m just tryin to find find find
That sweet love of mine
Where is my runway love
Know that I’m not givin’ up
I give it all up for her
I wont stop until I find
Last name West and my teeth Diamonds
she said yo wish ya could place your crazy rhyming
trying crazy suits on
stuntin in our high top louie’s
open up the door when you take her to the movies
when you meet the parents you tell De Niro
her boyfriend is zero she needs to cut the weirdo
next show they gotta up the zeroes
nobody rocking like this 60 years old
the hard johns and the walleys something caught me
I’m telling you what WuTang taught me
the young youth rocking the gold tooth
pull up in a drop top old school bumping the cash rules
no question we the reason why the summers blazin
you looking good fly color Asian
ra I give it yo ya no trivia
she used to roll with my gunit like Olivia
till she caught me getting numbers not her’s
guess that’s the day she became a runaway love
Where is my runway love
Know that I’m not givin’ up
I give it all up for her
I wont stop until I find
Why can’t i find the love of mine
When you’re standing in front of my face
Oh yeah You must be mine
How did I let you get away
Leave it up to the most high sit in a ghost fly
chillin with 2 of my brothers we both live on deck
this is how we roll independents she a go I’m gon go get
take that queen assure to ya
we can live every month baby girl just call me up
waking up mess in some cold sweats thinking of this the video tapes
my mind is a terrible thing to waste
no love lost I know Im going crazy I can’t floss

it’s all baloney just like rocking an old pony
so when I chillin I’m just lost no more feeling
I need my honey in my life get that film it
take the time Rae Just and Ye shine
my runaway love give me mine come on

Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
a world where men are free
there will be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found true light in a world
there will be peace on earth
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
but someday at Christmas time
No hungry children and no empty hands
One happy morning people will share
a world where people care
there will be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One sunny morning my heart ran away
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
but someday at Christmas time
Take hope because your love will prevail
Someday a new world where we can start
with hope in every heart
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
but someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas timeLyrics submitted by evanforaker

Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santas on his way
Hes loaded lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh
And every mothers child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so Im offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninetytwo
Although its been said many times many ways

Let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
And when shes around he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken
And it made her blind
She cant ever believe that love will treat her right
Did you know that I loved you
Well youre the smile on my face
But that aint going nowhere
If itll make you happy
Here see you smile but Ive been wanting to tell you this for a long while
Whos gonna make you fall
I know you got your wall
Wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all
But you cant fly unless you let your
You cant fly unless you let yourself fall
Well I can tell youre afraid of
Cuz we got to turn the maze in friendship and that you dont wanna lose
But I dont wanna loose it either
But I dont think I can stand sitting around while youre hurting baby
Well did you know youre an angel
Come from God out of line
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
Cuz I know that a piece of yous gone every time youre done wrong Im the shoulder youre crying on
And I hope by the time that Im done with this song Ill have figured out
Whats gonna make you fall
I know you got your wall
Wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all
But you cant fly unless you let your
You cant fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
Well I will catch you if you fall
And if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you cant fly unless you let your
You cant fly unless you let yourself fall
I know you got your wall
Wrapped all the way around your heart
Dont have to be scared at all
But you cant fly unless you let your

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now
Dont let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Dont want to be left with the questions why
Lets be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain
Yeah sometimes the heart can see whats invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
Well giving up is immature
Theres so much more to live for
That I want to see us together now
Cause were strong enough to endure woah
If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we got to learn to trust right now
Growing pains come along with these changes
Some people get closer some people separate yeah
Dont think we should separate
And we both adore one another
Youre a dream come true
We should start off brand new
Thats what we ought to do
Yeah sometimes the heart can see whats invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
Well giving up is immature
Theres so much more to live for
That I want to see us together now
Cause were strong enough to endure woah
If I believe in love and you believe in love

Oh we gotta learn to trust right now
Girl you gotta learn to trust me right now
If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love
If you want the best for us
I got the best for us
We gotta learn to trust
We gotta learn to trust
To keep a roof up over our heads
You chose life for me
No you never gave up
I admire you for the strength you instilled in me
You were just my age when you had me
Mom you were so brave
There was nothing that would stop or get in our way
And I know you will always be there for me
So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
Cause I still turn to you
I still turn to you
I still turn to you
The year that everything started to change
From before You had to be a woman
You were forced to change your ways
Then you found the Lord
You gave your life to Him
And you could not ignore
The love he had for you
And I wanted more of your heart
So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
Cause I still turn to you
I don’t know what I’d do if you left me
So please don’t go away
Everything that you are is who I am

Is a big big world
Its easy to get lost baby
Youve always been my girl
And Im not ready to go like this
We make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make the gray clouds turn to blue skies
I know its hard baby believe me
That we cant go nowhere but up
Baby we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we got to fear
We are taking to the sky pass the moon to the galaxy
As long as youre with me baby
Honestly with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up
Its a big big world
And Im gonna show you all of it
Im gonna leash you with pearls oh
From every ocean that were swimming in
We make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make the gray clouds turn to blue skies
Yeah I know its hard baby believe me oh
That we cant go nowhere but up
Baby we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we got to fear whoa
We are taking to the sky pass the moon to the galaxies
As long as you are with me baby
Honestly with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up
We are on the surface now
We are gonna make it girl
If you believe in love
And you believe in us
We cant go nowhere but up
That we can nowhere but up
Baby we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we got to fear
We are taking to the sky pass the moon to the galaxies
As long as you are with me baby
Honestly with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up
Yeah nowhere but up whoa whoa

Wait for a minute
You aint gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth dont make us relevant
Dont want us to lose what we are
Dont want us to lose what we are
If it aint broke then we dont need to fix it
Believing in that shell say Ill have you livid
No they wont be happy til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you dont wanna get it
They aint never had your back like I got it
They aint never had trust like how we got it
So they cant help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
You aint gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth dont make us relevant
Dont want us to lose what we are
Dont want us to lose what we are
Its like youre always looking for a problem
The raining of equations for you to solve em
So quick to turn nothin right into somethin
Get the numbers out my phone go head and call em
They aint never had my back like you got it
They aint never had a chance how you got it
So they cant help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
You aint gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth dont make us relevant
Dont want us to lose what we are
Dont want us to lose what we are
She texts me Hows your love life and How are you I said Im good
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together warm oceans better weather
Instead of us playing games forever she says whatever
I says whatever who get you wetter than a half moon wearer
HSTRY sweater serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did that one time in that one place
Blew your mind you got my mind going when Im home
Im serious girl a much older dude a whole 42
Ive accomplished my goals its only you
You and I in that Wraith retire my pimp superfly cape
Just my Mets cap and my badge and Im straight
You aint gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth dont make us relevant
Dont want us to lose what we are
Dont want us to lose what we are
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
When you dont want me to move
But you tell me to go
Said were running out of time
Better make up your mind
Youre so indecisive of what Im saying
Trying to catch the beat make up your heart
Dont know if youre happy or complaining
Dont want for us to end
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day make love all night
First you up then youre down and between
Ohh I really want to know
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
When you dont want me to move
But you tell me to go
Said were running out of time
Better make up your mind
Youre overprotective when Im leaving
Trying to compromise but I cant win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start wont let this end
First you wanna go to the left then you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day make love all night
First youre up then youre down then between
Ohh I really wanna know
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
When you dont want me to move
But you tell me to go
Said were running out of time
Better make up your mind
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
When you dont want me to move
But you tell me to go
Said were running out of time
Better make up your mind
