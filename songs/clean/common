We living in the night toast looking in her eye
On our paper til we get it like Dubai
Chi niggas stand up plastic cups
Girls with the drastic butts that ask for bucks
Bottles of Veuve pop here
And we gonna get around like 2Pacs here
Celebrate like its New Year

A couple hundred bitches around
So baby go on and get us a round
Cause I got all my niggas around

My guys I used to hoop with is now who I ball with
This raw bitch came in looking flawless
Tonight shell be giving conscious headlights
Beaming from the Beemer that her momma bought her
I got the act right for her like Im an author
Look where drama brought us look where karma brought us
Married to the game like Usher we was caught up
Now we got some RB broads we can call up
You niggas come around keep the wall up
Smoke blowing out thinking of tomorrow and the simple things
Hustlas from the go how far we done came
Everybody home aint nobody gone

Walk up in the thing got my campaign poppin
Champagne poppin bad thing poppin
Headed to the door and aint a damn thing knockin no
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin
I wrote this on my born day it was a warm day
Niggas gotta eat we gon do it gourmet
Im hearing fuckin voices like when porn play
Stay stay on your grind like foreplay
What more can I say Diamonds off for the day
That means to shine you find a way
Stayed on porches backyards and gangways
Learned strange ways between Cole and Langley
I pour it out for my man who made his transition
Wars about paper pussy pride and ego
Born to fly call me the bald eagle
Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and EazyE though
Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin
The hero that came from zero
My bars and my PR like Puerto Rico
This bra from the DR said I was frío
Thats Ice Cold like Dre triple three yo
Pinot noir style better with time
Im gambling with watches getting better with time
So Imma ride this out for long as God allow me
They say time is money forever is my salary
I shine tomorrow with what I do today
Yo get this money put the diamonds on display
Walk up in the thing and got my campaign poppin
Champagne poppin bad thing poppin
Headed to the door and aint a damn thing knockin no
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin
Hit you with the street sweeper now you gotta get to moppin no
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay
Tryna get it every way every day
Tryna get it every way every day
Tryna get it every way every day
Bars in alignment stars in alignment
Raw off consignment Gods in the diamonds
Evolve from the science power and refinement
Read between the lines hard to define us
Niggas thats behind us throwing up signs to signify us
In the Benz leaning like we biased
Ive seen Len Bias that shit scared me
You can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash
The moment is to live it like your last
Moments that we have never living in the last
My time man precious like diamonds
Look through the glass see what I magnify man
Imma be shining til I die man
Im a rare diamond thats hard to find man
Climbing to the mountain top MLK day
To the streets I speak my piece like an AK
47 To 87 to the hundreds
Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted
Dreams reflect clarity aint no disparity
Between peace and prosperity so marry me diamond
Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway
Im rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day
Way before the ballin that was back off in the training days
I used to hit the barber chair and say I need that fadeaway
Had a crush on whats her name the feelings never fade away
Older brother gang bang banging like an 808
Said you cant take his chain away
Real play you cant take his game away
Slang away walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller
But you cant take my dame away devil in a red dress
But she got that angel face
I could teach her how to get it day to day to day to day
The G code is my combination
Catch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces
Catch me in court beating all kinds of cases
Weed money pussy liquor thats my favorite compilation
Like an old man in a deep sleep
Or an Indian peace pipe
The beginning the end the first the last
Got a chick in the south that be cursin fast
When it was she tried a nigga nurse it last
The hunger of a homeless
Played the game it got a bonus
So much is the drive
I am the definition of a rider
Just one word cant describe her
A scribe of the streets
And a good life that we all wanna reach
Im hotter than a beach
I can inhale to bring the world in order
Hey baby am I crazy
Or were you giving me the eye
Because I know Im to fly
Already know Im too fly
Already know Im too fly
Already know Im too fly
I know what ya like
Right now Im off the wine
We can take our time time
So much I want to punch
Sell the bump when we grind
