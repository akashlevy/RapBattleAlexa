Damn damn ma we aint even have to go through it like that
It wasnt even even that big man
You know nah its ight though
But anyway yo let me get that coat
Let me get those jeans and let me get that rock on your finger
Oh its stuck Then Ill take the whole finger than man
Let me get those bags from Paris and the puppies is staying yo
Come through the block in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and this dude aint friends
Ok girl Yeah what I did was wack
But you dont get your man back like that
Flossin around when Im up in these streets
Knowing that me and this dude got beef
Ok girl Yo what I did was wack
But you dont get your man back like that no
Aiyo I should just bark on you burn your car on you
Cuz Im too much man to leave a mark on you
Youse a bird you know that giving that man
Ten points like he about to blow that
He probably did you swallow his kids
In and out of jail he a snail he wasnt wilding on bids
In the summertime I broke his jaw had to do it to him
Quick old fashion in the back of the mall
Me and him had mos forever like Im supposed to put him on
When he came home and told on Trevor
Had to bang on homey ear blocks out in spots
Throwing them shots like sucker you know me
Stop fronting for them people out side like you really ride
And you a silly chick thought you was really live
But I guess I was wrong Imma holla at dog and rip his head off word to his bond
Aiyo I thought we was iller than that all them kisses
And love yous when jake came you hid my packs
It was time a brother went to war vests banged up
Staining in the kitchen yo holding a four
Sweatin and breathing bounced out of town for a weekend
Heard you had homey in the passenger seating
Honey look Im a monster don I do monster things
Thats why I put your ass under my arm
Messing with him can bring bodily harm
And where you gonna hide in the streets when the body is gone
If its one thing I learned that never trust a female
On no scale you just confirmed that
Bounce to your momma house pack your shit
I dont care if you crying youse a ruthless chick
Gots to watch you these eyeballs in my facell spot you
My girl cousins they gon rock you
Shorty what is you thinking bout

Rolling with him trynna get revenge

Yo I aint got it all that means I barely home
Revenge is my arts is crafty darts
While yall stuck on Laffy Taffy
Wonderin how yall niggaz get past me
I been doin this before Nas dropped the Nasty
My wallos I did em up
Them bricks I send em up
My raps yall bit em up
For that now stick em up
Ten Four good buddy Tone got is money up
Worth millions still back your bitch lookin bummy what
Yall staring at the angel of death
Liar liar pants on fire You burning up like David Koresh
Verbal street opera pop a tec man fully got the projects booming indeed
I ran through the tunnel
Thats when I was still in the jungle slangin that D
Get out my face No you aint got no mo
Dont need no has been messin up my corner
And you better get that mad look off your face for I knock it off
Hey fool you ready for another beating
You should have never came back
Look here man after I crucify him you next
And you better have a good doctor to rearrange your face
Who want to battle the Don
Im James Bond in the Octagon with two razors
Bet chaall didnt know I had a fake arm
I lost it wild and raw before rap I was gettin it on
Took a fat nigga out in like 40secs
My gun get hard wit a 45 still erects and eagle on
Kangol hat slanted coconut bounce to Morocco
Guerilla medallions like Flavor Flav clock yo
Niggaz want me dead but they scared to step to me
Rip they guts out like a hysterectomy
When beef collide look on the flip by the penitentiary kite
Or get you bumped off from the inside
Frauds is leftin they draws on the floor complaining
Bird ass nigga resemble Keenon Ivory Waynes
Stay in your place dirt born rappers get Shadow box for training
Think nobody can dont give this nigga no statue give him death
I told yall I wasnt going away
You had your shot no give me mine
Now why dont you tell these folks why you been ducking me politics man
You think you going to keep me down
They dont want me to have the title
Because Im not a puppet like that fool up there
Ask his woman she get more pipe from the plumber than in bed
I like the deuce of diamonds cutting spades on a glass table
Half a mil on my left ankle
Terry cloth Guess shorts robes is comfortable
Bring me a nice bitch that means Ill fuck with you
My swagger is Mick Jaeger stones is rolling
Prestige is cut to it tis spark when weed went up
The Cocoa leaf is slightly damp
Sprouting in the backyard next to Gran duke tomato plants
And jets get charted marquee shit with the cars on it
They head and they earl to the toilet and vomit
Back East summer MC king since Cuban
Pretty Tone Iron Man and Bulletproof and Supreme
Proof and you double deuce in the jeans
My man was on the floor with the mother load both of them green
IBF WBC Cruiserweight title shots and Rap belts belong to DC
Listen I am bad I said I am bad
Im so bad sometimes Is scare myself
Sometimes I look in the mirror and want to kiss myself Im so pretty
Now who am I The Man
Now who am I The Man
Thats right and dont yall forget it
The winner by consecutive knockout and still champion of the worlllllllld
Ghostface KillllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaLyrics submitted by Bruno
Tommy Mattola lives on the road
He lost his lady two months ago
Maybe hell find her maybe he wont
Brothers try to pass me but none could match me
No girl can freak me Im just too nasty
Lost on the dance floors I attack yall
Snuck through the back door guess who they saw
Goldie and Ghost black African Rose
Starstudded low lenses plus the mural was dope
And cop a couple of these
Scottfree and Chauncey very upset
Theyre sick and tired of living in debt
Tired of roaches and tired of rats
I know they are over
One in the head Im fed this is how we doin
Put a Ruff Ryder on my dick bust right through em
Come out your shirt insert the party rhyme
Fine Dr Bizerk Bicardi Lime
We passin it takes the shake your Calvin Klein
Before the floor gets moist taste and follow mine
Swallow nine model dimes from Bahamas
Slim doodoo makers stuffed inside pajamas
Theyll take all your rhymes with a Colgate smile hey baby
Theyll love you one second then hate you the next
Oh aint it crazy baby yeah
Tonys his name the undefeated champion whoa yeah
Now hes alone hes just the king of his throne
Always will be my friend Ghostface Killah
OOOOO Ghostface Ghostface Killahx9Lyrics submitted by Dashia
Sometimes I feel like he dont hear me
Sometimes I wonder do he love me
Life is so hard for me
This aint the way its supposed to be
I pray every night asking for forgiveness
Sometimes ask myself is it worth it
Life is so pain painful
Yet Im so thank thankful
Life wont be easy and I know that
My past is over wish I can go back
Sometimes times in life we all feel like we are feel like we falling
Those who suffer in life will be rewarded
Lord I hear you but its so hard being strong
I keep reminiscing all my loved ones that are gone
He says hun you should know youre born to die
I say I do its just so hard saying bye
Thats why feel like you dont hear me
Sometimes I wonder do you love me
Life is so hard for me
This aint the way its supposed to be
