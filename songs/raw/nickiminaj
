Ooh ooh ooh
I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart

Even though I said I didn’t love you I lied I lied
Even though I said I didn’t need you I lied I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said don’t touch me I lied, I lied
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
I can’t let you think that Imma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said let’s see
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fucking proof
Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose
You just a heart breaker won’t let you break mine
Cause I’ll be smashing windows and cutting them break lines

I lied
Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you
Who knows, who knows, so I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

Even though I said fuck you, I lied, I lied
I thought eventually you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss miss the d o
Man it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real it was magic
If it was a record it would have been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic

This is what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth, who knew what you’d
Do If I let you in
My mama ain't raised no fool
I am not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Falling so fast I am afraid of you

So I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
I lied, ooh baby, oooh
Cause what if I let myself go with you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.

Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was o' six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I look down, yes I suppose

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'm a ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end
I know it's sudden, look at what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said, he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know, that I love him
Family ties, broken before me, niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'm a ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end
I know it's sudden, look at what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact
I'd give it all, if somehow, I could just rekindle that
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say "We did it!"
My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen, any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is the Pinkprint

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go---

My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

Boy toy named Troy
Used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money
He was getting some coins
Was a shooter with the law
But he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen
He was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse
Bitch I came for us to kill
Who wanna go first?
I had them push daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half of pill
I'm on some dumb shit

By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck 'em in my automobile
And I'm hitting it with his girls
And he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real
That he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney
He want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag
And I hit 'em with the jab like
Dum du-du-dum, du-du-du-du-dum dum

My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

Oh my gosh, look at her butt

Look at her butt (look look look, look at her butt)

This dude named Michael
Used to buy motorcycles
Dick bigger than a tower
I ain't talking about Eiffel
Real country ass nigga
Let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep
Now he calling me Nyquil
Now that bang bang bang
I let him hit it cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name romaine
And when we done
I make him buy me romaine
I'm on some dumb shit

By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck 'em in my automobile
And I'm hitting it with his girls
And he telling me to chill
And he telling me it's real
That he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like em boney
He want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag
And I hit em with the jab like

Oh my gosh, look at her butt
Oh my gosh, look at her butt

Look at her butt (look look look, look at her butt)

Pull at the middle
But you got much pack
Pull at the middle
But you got much pack
Oh my God
(Look at her pack)

My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

Don't don't don't, my anaconda don't
D-d-don't want none

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush
And you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, man, you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked, all along
I'mma ask on the song

So does she know I've been in that bed before?
A thousand count, and not a single threaded truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better, than to look in your eyes
They only pretend, you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved

Chorus:]
Baby you my everything you all I ever wanted.
We can do it real big.
Bigger then you ever done it.
You be up on everything.
Other hoes ain't never on it.
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it.

Cause she hold me down everytime I hit her up.
When I get right I promise that we gon live it up.
She make me beg for it till she give it up.
And I say the same thing every single time.

[Hook]
I say you the fucking best.
You the fucking best.
You the fucking best.
You the fucking best.
You the best I ever had.
Best I ever had.
Best I ever had.

[Drake: Verse 1]
Know you got a roommate
Call me when its no one there
Put the key under the mat
And you know I'll be over there
(Yup) I'll be over there
Shawty, I'll be over there
I'll be hitting all the spots that u ain't even know was there
Ha. And you ain't even have to ask twice
You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustom to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chilling with no make up on
Thats when your the prettiest
I hope that you don take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to them rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one to Never get confused with Cause.

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj: Verse 2]
Ayo you da only one that see the real Nicki
I could show you chill Nicki Cause of how you deal wit me
When dey knock my blocks down you come and you build with me
Even though you real busy
Youse da fuckin real Drizzy
It's so amazing I figured out this world is ours with tha taking
I figured out that when I go out an all those people scream thats some of them are living varcariously for me
That's why I put that "S" on ma chest and I'm gone
But on another note let's have sex in my dorm
And imma make you beg cause you look pretty when you beggin
So meet me on the campus I'll be there around 11.

So lemme put my books down
Exscuse me if I look down
Guess imma little nervous
But I'm at your service
Look at what you took down

[Chorus]

[Drake: Verse 3]
Sex, Love, Pain
Baby I be on that tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disk
When my album drop
Bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl
But money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee
Cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make yo pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on
double cup love
You the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix then you should really get yo pheen on
Yea just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there repping like a mascot
Get it from the back
And make yo fucking bra strap pop
All up in yo slot until the nigga hit the jackpots

[Chorus]

[Hook]
I say you the fucking best.
You the fucking best.
You the fucking best.
You the fucking best.
Best I ever had.
Best I ever had.
Best I ever had.
Best I ever had.
Best I ever had.---Lyrics submitted by Mel.

[Intro: Meek Mill]
You hear that right there?
That sound like, but that 300 thousand nigga
I'm triple OG in my hood
These hoes call me big daddy

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Your bitch call me big daddy
Tell that bitch that I'm big daddy
When I hit the lot I don't get the little bitch
Nigga I go and get the big daddy
Pick a bitch up in the big daddy
Big face Rollie that's a big daddy
Got your bitch calling me big daddy
When I pull up all the hoes like big daddy
Nigga I'm big daddy

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Standin' on the corner in some shit that look like I payed like a million for
Blowin' the money I heard that they askin' around town what he really worth
Most of these niggas be really broke I went the Hardaway boy had a penny first
Now these bitches gon' get this work
I tell her keep on them heels and that mini skirt
She Google my net worth, lookin' like "what is his neck worth?"
My shooters, they shoot at your head, like the rim just to see if the net work
I land in Miami then fly out to Cali with some of my best work
You niggas so lame that my bitches won't fuck unless you cut a check first

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Pulled up in something that look like a million, nigga put me up on
Ain't gotta sell it, but he say the pussy a drug that he re-up on
Spur of the moment I ball like Ginobli you bitches get D'ed up on
You mad at me go get mad at your nigga 'fore I put my sneakers on
He cop me this wrist game, now its just us at the Knicks game
I might have to take him on tour just to fuck in Australia, Brisbane
Your time is ticking you bitches will be around shorter than Vine vids
You watch your mouth or my niggas will shoot up the club like what Shyne did

[Hook: Meek Mill]

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
You bitches ain't stupid, you bitches ain't stupid
You bitches ain't stupid, is you?
Front like she tough but that bitch keep on crying
Get this bitch a tissue
For what it's worth when I took him I could tell he would never miss you
I ain't even wanna diss you, but tell me what is this bitch issue?

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Still on top, pretty bitch gang
Pussy still tight, pistol still bang
Yo nigga call me big mama
Let him eat the pussy then I dip on him

How could it me, little me
Had the power to be the best B, in the league
Yeah inevitably, but could it be little me
You was heckling me, now it's monotony when I regularly
I catch wreck on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations
because I got it in 'em, I kill 'em and then I skin 'em
the contract is on but I am the addendum
So wh-where my dawgs at, Randy
Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy
Ca-ca-ca-cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me nooooow, I dare you, Bambi
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
I aint even detonate the palms and the arsenal
Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron,
ahh, ha hahahaha ha
I'm the best now, anybody with some money should invest now
Soccer mom needs to organize a pep rall'
You game over bitch, Gatorade, wet towel
Mothafuckers aint ready, they neva been
As long as I am in the game, you'll never win
I'm on that different type of high, heroin

Ugh, yea, ugh this is the moment grab your Kodak
While I'm flying with a flow that is the greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan
And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder
And the lights even brighter, baby stand next to my fire
Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah
'rari six hundred horses, that's my chariot of fire?
Where we flying, they can't find us all them broke days behind us
I just took your whole life and redesigned it
I think I'm Marc Jacobs, I think I'm Lagerfeld
I think without makeup, you still bad as hell
Imma grab your waist then, Imma grab your face and
Then Imma taste it, then Imma blaze it
Hello all my bad girls, this just in yeezy hurt the beat

And he just did it again, He crazy, he blazin, he off the deep end

[Intro (Throughout): Alicia Keys]
You should say it right now

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Cause I don't use the shit anyway
But okay, I guess it's my fault
Westside shorty, with an eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say "love"
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy
The heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side?

[Hook: Meek Mill & Nicki Minaj]
Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Rahmeek, I'mma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause its too much, and its too clutch
Who wants rumors of two of us
But when you're away I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I met the one and you're wasting your time
But you waited

[Hook]

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Its a heart for sale who's buying

I push, p-p-push it, I p-p-push it like I'm in labor 
And he'll t-t-teach me to, teach me love my neighbor 
Just w-w-wait up, I'm processin' all the data 
Processin' all the data, p-p-processin' all the haters 
You was writin' disses, I was takin' pictures 
Signin' autographs for all of my bad bitches 
And in the nic of time it just dawned on 
I am Nicki Minaj and it's all on me 
But hey, maybe I'll never win 
Maybe I'm settlin' 
Can't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroin 
But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn 
Write down, take a pictures, bitches e-mail that 
I came to save a thing called female rap 
But I hope my ninja powers 
Don't fuck around and offend you cowards 
You mad at me `cus you think I got it easy 
If we was in the second grade then you would tease me 
Ya see, you still a lil snotty nose hood rat 
I love Nicki scribbled all over you book bag 
I love you too, I just wish your mother would've hugged you too 
You know Nicki love the kids 
Yellow brick road lookin' for the Wiz 
But when it rains, it pours for real 
Def Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill 
Can't rap and sing on the same CD 
The public won't get it, they got A.D.D. 
See Nicki, follow the rules 
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school 
(Yeah follow the rules, go and say my prayers and get ready for school) 

Dear God, I am only what you made me 
And I appreciate everything that you gave me 
But like, I don't wanna do it no more 
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for 
Thought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game 
Until they all started throwin' dirt on my name 
Tell Debbie, I really, really tried 
That I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye 
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him 
And please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted 
( I'll never forget it, please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted)

Pim-Pim-Pim-Pim-PIMP.---Lyrics submitted by Trever.

Bitches they serious
 Yeah these bitches delirious
 All this bitches inferious
 I just pimp my interiors
 I just pick up and go
 Might pick up a hoe
 Might give conversations
 If you kick up the dough
 Never mind my money
 Never mind my stats
 Every bitch wanna be me
 You can find them in sacks
 Pink Friday two Milli
 Superbass triple plat
 When you see me on Ellen
 Just admit that I'm winning
 Do a show for Versace
 They request me by name
 And if they don't get Nicki
 It just won't be the same
 When I'm sitting with Anna
 I'm really sitting with Anna
 Aint a metaphor, punchline
 I'm really sittin with Anna
 Front row at Oscar De La Renta, posture
 Aint a bitch that could do it, not even my imposter
 Put these bitches on lockout, where the fuck is your roster
 I pull up in that new new, marinara and pasta

[Chorus]

 Shake my head, yo I'm mad, aint a bitch in my zone
 In the middle of nowhere, I just feel so alone
 Got the certification, cause it come with the stone
 But this ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
 That shit come on a cone, it should come on a cone
 And my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
 That shit come on a cone, it should come on a cone
 Cause my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone


7up went and gave, my commercial to Cee-Lo
 But dont tell 'em I said it, lets keep it on the d-low
 If you need you a look, just put me on your song
 But you know it'll cost, about 6 figures long
 But you bitches ain't got it, where the fuck is your budgets
 Flying spurs for hers means i'm fuckin above it
 And I just got a ghost and i'm callin it Casper
 But this shit is so cold it belong in Alaska
 Why da fuck i'm I stylin I competes with myself
 When u win against Nicki u depleted your wealth
 And i'm not masturbating but i'm feelin myself
 Paparazzi is waitin cuz them pictures would sell
 Yeah now dont you feel stupid yeah dats egg on your face
 If you wasn't so ugly i'd put my dick in your face
 Dick in your face put my dick in your face

[Chorus]

 Shake my head, yo I'm mad, aint a bitch in my zone
 In the middle of nowhere, I just feel so alone
 Got the certification, cause it come with the stone
 But this ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
 That shit come on a cone, it should come on a cone
 And my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone
 That shit come on a cone, it should come on a cone
 Cause my ice is so cold, it should come on a cone

and tell that you coming back, and you just took a break
maybe i blamed you for everything, that was my mistake
in high in site i loved your rawness and i loved your edge
cuz it was you who took me down from jumping off the ledge 
your earrings bamboo, your long nails to, 
your BMW everytime you came through
you was the brave heart ♥
you stole wayne heart :p ♥
you never switched it up, you played the same part
but i needed to grow, and i needed to know
was there some things inside of me that i needed to show
so i just deaded you, left you in all black
but dear old Nicki, please call back  ♥ :,^(

you told me, you'll come when, i needed you
and you said it so sweetly, i believed you 
but im standing, here calling, i cant see you
but i am holding you, holding you, holding you, to dat

yo, did i chase the glits and glamour, money, fame, and power
cuz if so that will forever go down my lamest hour
i shoulda kept you wit me, getting at them nameless cowards
they was no match for you, couldnt defeat you powers
i had to make them changes
i hope you understood
you see for every bad, i did a ton of good
but you was underground, and i was mainstream
i live a life now, that we would day dream
my only wish is you come enjoy it wit me
get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers wit me
the money came yea, tripled, and quadrupled  it
but i still miss up when we were just on some stupid shit
and it still fucked the media
they ridiculed you never believed in ya 
they just deaded you, left you in all black
but, dear old Nicki, please call back

you told me, you'll come back when, i needed you
and you said it so sweetly, i believed you 
but im standing, here calling, i cant see you
but i am holding you, holding you, holding you, to dat

yes im holding you, holding you, holding you 
yes im holding you, holding you, holding you   (2x's)
yes im holding you, holding you, holding you
                                 to dat---Lyrics submitted by ahzheona.

[Verse 1 - Jeremih:]
I don't want no drama
I just wanna be your diamond, babe
Guaranteed to be a problem
Every time I get around you, babe
I just want you to need me
You might really wanna try me, babe
All I know I want a rider
All I know I want a rider, babe
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe, ah yeah...

[Verse 2 - Nicki Minaj:]
Yo, I just wanna be ya rider
You should pull up in that Spider
You should let me hit the mic
And I ain't talking about the fighter
Get it lit without a lighter
Let's pull an all-nighter
Tell me-tell me what you need, got the weed
I'm a bad lil bitch and I never indict her
Get locked, I'mma write ya
You on the road? I'mma Skype ya
I don't wanna hype ya
But you a lucky nigga if my mean ass like ya
You ain't never have a bitch understand you
Most of them wanna use you when they ran through
I just wanna be somebody, that can add to
Your wife, be a friend, be a teacher and a fan too
I just wanna listen
When you leave I say "damn, I fucking miss him"
I just wanna be your vixen
Give you something real wet, to put your lips in
I wanna be the only one that can check you, and still respect you
Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

[Hook - Jeremih:]
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
Won't you let me be your favorite?

[Verse 3 - Nicki Minaj:]
Ayo, I just wanna be your first go to
Treat me like a real one s'posed to, livin' bi-coastal
Scoop me in the truck, late night, wanna humble
Meet me out in Queens, where the city want a sundown
You could put your gun down, you could have fun now
You could tell you niggas that you won now, one down
Run through the clubs with the baddest
Bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters
And they say Berkin where the bag is
Gotta lot of bags, but we never got baggage
Went to Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance
I'mma have you coming in my palace
London, Tokyo, Paris, let me update your status
Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

I'm with some hood girls lookin' back at it
And a good girl in my tax bracket
Got a black card that let Saks have it
These Chanel bags is a bad habit
I-I do balls, Dal Mavericks, my Maybach, black matted
Bitch, never left but I'm back at it
And I'm feelin' myself, jack rabbit
Feelin' myself, back off, cause I'm feelin' myself, jack off
He be thinking about me when he whacks off, whacks on? Wax off
National anthem hats off, then I curve that nigga, like a bad toss
Lemme get a number two, with some Mac sauce
On The Run Tour, with my mask off

[Post-Hook: Beyoncé]
Changed the game with that digital drop

I stop the world, world stop...

Kitty on fleek, pretty on fleek
Pretty gang, always keep them niggas on geek
Ridin' through Texas, fearin' for his breakfast
Everytime I whip it, I be talkin' so reckless
He said "Damn Nicki it's tight," I say "Yeah nigga you right"
He say "Damn, bae, you so little, but you be really takin' that pipe"
I say "Yes daddy I do, gimme brain like NYU"
I said "Teach me, nigga, teach me. All this learnin' here is by you"

Cookin' up the base, lookin' like a kilo
He just wanna taste, biggin' up my ego
Ego, ego, ego, ego, ego, ego, ego, ego

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
He gettin' gifts from Santa Claus at the North Pole
Today I'm icy, but I'm prayin' for some more snow
Let that ho ho, let that ho know, he in love with that coco
Why these bitches don't never be learnin'
You bitches will never get what I be earnin'
I'm still gettin' plaques, from my records that's urban
Ain't gotta rely on top 40
I am a rap legend, just go ask the kings of rap
Who is the queen and things of that nature
Look at my finger, that is a glacier, hits like a lazeeeeer...
Trippin' on that work, trippin' off that purp
Flippin' up my skirt and I be whippin' all that work
Takin' trips with all them ki's, car keys got B's
Stingin' with the Queen Bey and we be whippin' all that D
Cause we dope girls we flawless, we the poster girls for all this
We run around with them ballers, only real niggas on my call list
I'm the big kahuna, go let them whores know
Just on this song alone, bitch is on her fourth flow

You shoulda left, the other day
You let me beg, for you to stay
This is a sickening joke that you play with my emotions
And so I pray you burn in hell and you never find the ocean

I hope your fire, fire burns baby
I hope your fire, fire burns baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told
And when you're reaching out for me you'll see you reap everything you sow

You piece of shit, you broke me down
Thought you said you, would hold me down
But I can see it in your eyes that your blinded by the flashing lights
And you's a stupid muthafucker for letting this thing pass you by

I hope your fire, fire burns baby
I hope your fire, fire burns baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told
And when you're reaching out for me you'll see you reap everything you sow---Lyrics submitted by BarbieLuvsYuh.

[Intro: Asabe Ighile]
Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four door, no floor

[Verse 1]
Hit me on the celly, watching Belly
God's son, I can see they study Makaveli
Peanut butter Benz, got them jelly at the deli
If you feeling like a ninja, I got a machete
Hell yeah, them girls bad, but I'm fucking heavy
I'mma fuck around and have them looking like spaghetti
I say some shit, he be like, "Yo, you so legendary"
But he can tell just by my face he ain't getting any

[Hook: Asabe Ighile] (x2)
Plenty more for you, boy
We in the funky four door, no floor
He was serving that raw, oh boy
She was making that noise, oh boy

[Verse 2]
Meet me at the Rucker, take the Bruckner
It's just me and Young Yucka, taking suckers
For they money and they whips, putting kitten on lips
Dividing the dividends, get the money and dip
Keys to the nigga's safe, put it under my tits
He got ki's of that raw, it could fit in the six
Got a UPS connect, so we good on them trips
Automatic bottle service so we good in them VIPs, nigga

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3]
These civilians, what up nigga? Excuse my millions
I'm in the V like a widow's peak
It's just me and my Rolls Royce pillow seats
Why they staring at me? I brung MacLaren with me
Yo, matter of fact, I think I'mma bring Donna Karan with me
And you my son, I don't know, it's just the parent in me
I am the best, I am the queen, it's so apparent in me
I'm in Hollywood with Shia Labeouf
Most of you rappers ain't eating, that diet is rough
You want some hot shit? Send that wire to us
I make them change their name to Diddy, retire the puff
I'm getting acting money
You niggas is Kevin Hart, y'all be acting funny
I'mma a keep a linebacker, tell 'em tackle for me
Yo, you seen my last pic, go double-tap that for me
Cock back, Red octagon, stop that

[Hook] (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.

[Verse 1]
Don't ever thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross
Cause your spirit is ungrateful, bitches is so hateful
I remain a staple
My career's been the pink print
When I retire, tell 'em think pink
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic, instinct
Oh shit, my commercial's on
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs?
Did I really prophecy every thing I do?
But before I continue let me thank my crew
So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine
Baby & Slim came
Tez & E.I. told me it wouldn't be in vain
Cause prior to me signing
I could've went insane
And even now I think do I really want this fame
Let me get up and go, 700 to go
Overseas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm starting the show
Man I'm birthing these artists
And I'm starting to show

[Hook (x2)]
I feel free
I feel freedom
Why they mad?
You should see them
Burn a L
Cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here
Crazy in here

[Verse 2]
Who I wanna work with? Nobody
99% of dem, is nobody
bitches acting like they killing shit, OK
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
niggas spend they last dime to say they copped the soonest
Why these niggas going broke to get ya approval?
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on dem Ramen Noodles
B-b-b-bible, Queen is the title
And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal
And if you in the club then it's a Young Money recital
I'm just that vital
I'm busy, never idle
I'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin' idol
Pink Friday in Macy's
Thongs and some pasties
(Yo, what other female rapper perfume in there? Cause I must've missed it)
12 milli to kick me feet up
Get ready this is the RE-UP

[Hook (x2)]
I feel free
I feel freedom
Why they mad?
You should see them
Burn a L
Cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here
Crazy in here

[Bridge]
Mirror, mirror, won't you realize?
I just have to decide
What you hiding from?
What you hiding from?

Mirror, mirror, won't you realize?
I just have to decide
What you hiding from?

Baby, just get on your knees
Say pretty please, say pretty please, say pretty please
Baby, just say pretty please

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I'll be back at 11, you just act like a peasant
Got a bow on my panties because my ass is a present
Yeah it's gooder than Meagan, you look good when you're beggin'
I be laughing when you beggin' me to just put the head in
Let me sit on your face, it's ok you can play with it
When I'm bouncin' it, chill out and don't you make a mistake with it
Let me see what you're workin' with, If I'm ridin', I'm murkin' it
Slow grindin', I'm twerkin' it, yeah I bagged him, I Birkin'd it

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I don't need a dozen roses
You ain't gotta wine and dine me, no
I don't need a pretty poet
Oooh, gettin' all emotional
You gotta beg for it, beg for it
I wanna see you lookin' up
Baby I'ma need you to beg for it

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Gimme brain, assume the position
Make me way smarter like you was a magician
Paid my dues and tuition, it's good for your nutrition
Get head like a beautician, got me twitchin', finish your mission
You make it cum down, you make it run down
I'ma need you to give these other dudes the rundown
You got that legendary, this shit is fake, scary
Got me seein' them fireworks, I'm on my Kate Perry

[Pre-Chorus]

[Bridge: Ariana Grande (Nicki Minaj)]
Cause we are just animals
Baby it's primal
I want you on all fours
(And before I let you walk, you gotta show me how you crawl)
If you want it all
It's non negotiable
So do as I say
(If you wanna get the job, you better know who's the boss)

[Nicki Talking]

Yo, SB. I think it's my time... 
You know why? My tears have dried, 
And I know that no weapon formed
Against me will prosper. And I truly
Believe that my haters are my motivaters.
Young Money.

[Chorus]

If you could you would get rid of me, 
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard.
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne.
I done put the choke hold now 
They screamin, "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I'm Still the one to beat.
Ain't in a rush for mainstream
I am the streets. I am gettin it in until the end
I gotta go, GO, gooo, GO HARD! 

[Verse 1 - Nicki]

Carter called, lemme get the car key, you don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquis, everything sparkly (man down! ) hit em on a walkie-talkie.
Hit em, hit em knock-knock, tell em let me in. my name ring bells bitch buzz me in
And I only stop for pedestrians, or a real real bad lesbian.
Hit em wit the Mac, hit em wit the Tec 9, hit em wit the Ruger by the intersect line. hit em wit a tommy so my niggas call me Pammy and I always the jammy in the trunk or in the lamby
Put my whole burrough on my back and I'm gooda, I don't wanna hear what you would, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up, used to drink water wit a little bit of sugar.
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups, doin the scissor-leg on the mat wit my foot up.
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up, now I'm tellin LA Reid to step his bid up.
And I'm tellin President Carter he picked a winner, bitches like nelly and kelly got a dilemma
These birds all fly south in the winter, fuck I look like chompin on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle; I'ma be a queen no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle, louis on the duffle. I'm a bad bitch no muzzle (no muzzle).
Bitches is softer than Al Dente, cut from a different kenta. tell em I'm the ninja, 
Weezy is my sensei. so I call him splinter, faster than a sprinter. gimme my chopsticks
I'll have the rap bitches for dinner.
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups and khakis
This is for my nigga 7-up in Castaki
This is for my niggas whellying them Kawasakis
Shout out to the back-east, South Ishakis.
Kisses to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda cocky.
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky.
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinski.
Pumps on the clutch, right hand on the six-speed.
Write my own raps I gotta go, I gotta get me (gotta get me.)
OOhhh! 

[Chorus]

If you could you would get rid of me, 
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
Bet I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard.
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne.
I done put the choke hold now 
They screamin, "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I will, I gots to win.
I'm still lookin around for my
Com-pe-tition. I am gettin it in until the end
I gotta go, GO, gooo, GO HARD! 

[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]

From slap-and-cry you start to die, so I must go harder.
Gotta make these bitches know me just like Bobby know water.
Better yet, like Bubba know shrimp. but he don't say shit
When the gun on his lip, and I don't say shit put the gun
On my hip. so I don't say shit but the gun on my hip.
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm nasty than a summa bitch.
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
It yeen got money, don't come on my strip
And if ya got money, don't cover my strip
I wear that metal, no olympic, but I can still
Make you tumble and flip
You fuckin wit me if you fuckin wit Nick
They ain't fuckin wit me they ain't fuckin wit Nick
Your girlfriend, her descision is split
Cuz she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nick
They wonder if he be fuckin Nick, as long as she be fuckin rich
That's why I keep my luggage cuz, I swear yall's a fuckin trip.
Young Money Dungeon, bitch. my swagger just punch a bitch
And I shoot like I'm from over-seas, so call my gun, "Gunovich"
Weezy F. Baby and the "F" is for a bunch of shit
Red drank, blue pill, white dust
Yes I love my country bitch.

(Wayne: yeah!... guitar.)

[Chorus]

Wish you could get rid of Young Money, 
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
Bet I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard.
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne.
I done put the choke hold now
They screamin, "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I will, I gots to win.
I'm still lookin around for my
Com-pe-tition. I am gettin it in until the end
I gotta go, GO, gooo, GO HARD!---Lyrics submitted by brantorea.

[Verse 1]
Am I just a fool?
Blind and stupid for loving you
Am I just a silly girl?
So young and naive to think you were

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The one who came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark

[Chorus]
(And now the people)
The people are talking, the people are saying
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano
The people are talking, the people are saying
That you have been playing my heart like a grand piano
So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on

[Verse 2]
Am I being a fool?
Wrapped up in lies and foolish truths
What do I see in you?
Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cause I keep thinking you were
The one who came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
He said he came from Jamaica
He owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things
Ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo
And grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
5-year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him
Put him on lock, seat-belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order
I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk
But I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa
I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
They holler at me but it's you
You, this ain't high school
Me, and my crew
We can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Whip it whenever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby it's your world
Ain't it?
Baby it's your world
Ain't it?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
She got a nigga at home
And one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money, she tell me make her a wife
I tell her, "bitch, you crazy.
Fuck wrong with you?"
And excuse my french, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, "What about them niggas?"
She say, "What about them niggas?"
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight
Don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother
But fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven
Too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it
The genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine
I tell her stop lying
Mine and who else?
She say worry 'bout yourself
Lil Tune

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
They holler at me but its you
You, this ain't high school
Me, and my crew
We can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want
Whip it whenever you want
Baby, it's yours
Anywhere, everywhere
Baby it's your world
Ain't it?
Baby it's your world
Ain't it?

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
I know you want it, boy
I see you tryin'
Just keep on pushin'
I'ma let you slide in
Just close your eyes and
This horizon
It's ready, come get you some
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah---Lyrics submitted by Sophierhard.

Big booty strippers, I'm tippin
Big ass chain, I'm heavy
And it didn't cost me a penny
They pay me to rock it
Damn, I got niggaz in pocket
Superbowl; Grammys

All these bitches my sons
I'ma get 'em a nanny
Argentina for Pepsi; Orlando All-Star
Fuck you said bitch?; Fuck you, porn star
I don't do shotgun, I be driving my own car
I don't do shots neither, I'm buyin the whole bar
Holy moley, G copped me a Rolly
I ain't catchin the puck
but iced out like a goalie nigga

[Chorus: repeat 4X]
I'm in the HOV lane, I'm in the HOV lane
And you, y-you-you, y-you-you Soul Train

I travel more than you walkin with a basketball
I'm out in Spain, runnin game to the matador
I'm in my own lane, you ain't in my category
You like a Rav 4, I'm like the Aventa door
Perks and bags, man I merc them ads
When I re-up on "Reloaded" I'ma hurt them bad
Every shoot is hot, when I'm out I'm spotted
They gone frame the receipt if I sign the dotted
N-n-niggaz on Banshees is speedin
Dirt bikes is out for the season
Back break wheelie and leanin
Damn, a bitch late for a meetin
N-N-NYPD comin
Bellbock way, we gunnin
Double our engine hummin
Actin a fool, we dumbin

[Chorus]

[Interlude: repeat 2X]
N-N-Nintendo and we in the end-zone

[Verse: 1 - Nicki]

Uh, look sucka, this my gun butta'
Street fighter bitches, dis' da' up cutta'
Nunchuka'
No time to ducka', sign of the cross
Cause this is her last suppa'
Play with me, check who came with me
I bought a couple 9's, plus the K's wit' me
I breeze through Queens to check some bad bitches
I stunt so hard, access the damages
Cause this is that oh!, this is that oh!
And yes i body bitches, go get the bandages
Young yummy, fuck you got from me
I hate a phony bitch that front that chum chummy
I'm me the top shotta', drop the top toppa'
Big fat pussy, with a icy watch.

[Chorus]

I am your leader
Yes i am your leader
You're not a believer
Suck a big dick

[Verse: 2 - Nicki]

When I fly, it's one letter & one numba'
You wack hoes could get hot for one summa'
After that the Queen, I still reign here
I'm Santa Clause to these hoes without a reindeer
Saint Nick, Ross, hey Rick
I just gotta' toy, cost $850
Now I'm in the hood, niggas' is gettin' woodies
Hit up Hot Topic, Nicki Minaj hoodies
I'm a brand bitch, imma' brand
Go to Harlem and get Cam
It's dipset, get your dick wet
Boarded the big jet & gotta' big check
Now you tell me, who the fuck is winnin'
I'm on my Russel Simmons
Nicki denim
Nicki linen.

[Chorus]

I am your leader 
Yes i am your leader
You're not a believer
Suck a big dick.

[Verse: 3 - Rick Ross]

Jealous niggas' is gossip
Watch me tie up my laces, (woah)
Bitches be jockin'
Tell by the look on they faces
8 digits I'm clockin'
A lot of gold in my bracelet 
7 figures on watches
I told my momma' i made it 
Made a deal for my project
Just give me $10 mil', I'm gravy
I went back to the projects
& $2 mil' in Mercedes
I get hit from your lady, have her bill me later
I'm on school with the hustle
Just gave Rihanna my pager
Heart break hotel, I'm in the 8 rise suit
Rolls Royce wood, I'm talkin' play-off seat
Know that boy busy ballin', I like to play all week
Monday Night with the Raw
I'm Vince McMahon with the beat
Power slammin' them hammers
I getchu' handle for free, so where the fuck is her manners?
She give me brain while I tweet.

[Chorus & End of Rick Ross' Verse]

Dm, In the DM, you CM
You fuck it, you love it
Mothafucka's on my dick
Suck it.

I am your leader
Yes i am your leader
You're not a believer
Suck a big dick.

[Verse: 4 - Cam'ron]

See the car is European
But got it imported from Tokyo
Lookin' like a shark
The nose, call it Pinnochio
Well off, wealthy, LV, logo
Middle of July but the wrists is on snowfloor
Only do the aspens, ya'll can have the Poconos
I'm sunny & you my sun
Ride the whip, 5 on the hip
Live with the pies, got 9 for the flip
High with a bitch, she cry for the dick
Oh my know why I'm fly as it gets
Now I need a asprin
She said you're only Cameron
Girlfriend you don't know Cameron from nowhere
So don't go tamperin'
You're just a nail I hammer
'Nother girl that's on my camera
My name you cannot slander at all girl
Watch your manners
She run and tell her mother, I think I love him Nana
Because you sat up on my lap, Nah I ain't Santa
They call me p-piper
OJ no glove, I knife her
Never be a wifer
Why would I fight her? Don't even like her.

[Chorus: x2]

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart

Even though I said I didn’t love you I lied I lied
Even though I said I didn’t need you I lied I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
Even though I said don’t touch me I lied, I lied
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
I can’t let you think that Imma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said let’s see
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fucking proof
Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose
You just a heart breaker won’t let you break mine
Cause I’ll be smashing windows and cutting them break lines

I lied
Cause who knew if I should let myself go with you
Who knows, who knows, so I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

Even though I said fuck you, I lied, I lied
I thought eventually you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss miss the d o
Man it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real it was magic
If it was a record it would have been classic
But fuck you though, orgasmic

This is what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth, who knew what you’d
Do If I let you in
My mama ain't raised no fool
I am not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Falling so fast I am afraid of you

So I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
I lied, ooh baby, oooh
Cause what if I let myself go with you ---

[Ciara - Hook x2:]
I-I-I'm the shit
With no makeup
Don't have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine
I'mma dolla worth a dime
Real bosses stand up
Ladies throw your hands up
And say I know I'm cute
I know I'm fly
You ask me why
Cause I'm the shit

[Nicki Minaj - Verse 1:]
Beat em like they stole something
Treat em like they stole something
All this booty here got them dreaming
Let me hold something
Lemme lemme hear that boy
Lemme lemme wear that boy
Let me get the most expensive car
And let me steer that boy
Real big pretty titty
Shut down any city
If you want the kit kitty
Gotta get the key for me
All new everything
Plus pay the rent fo' me
If we in the wilderness
Bitches pitch a tent for me
Tent for me, tent for me, get my body
Long hair no make up doing pilates
Those niggas don't stand on my damn zanotti's
All them bitches is my sons but who's the daddy
I-I graduate with honors
I ball Nate O' Conner
I did a freestyle then I got a shoutout from Obamer
Yes, Yes I am ill
I go in for the kill
Hoes is my sons birth control I am on the pill
What I gotta do what I gotta do to 'em
Step up in the club everybody like who 'dem
Girls, girls, me and my girls
Watcha done did I need some referrals
Motherfuckers know I'm the shit legit
And if a motherfucker dont he can suck my dick
I tell 'em everybody else is my opposite
I put 'em on the gang gimme 5 percent

[Ciara - Hook x2:]
I-I-I'm the shit

You ask me why
Cause I'm the shit

[Nicki Minaj - Verse 2:]
I'm like really famous
I got a famous anus
No, not Famous Amos
All this famous heinous
Lemme lemme hear that boy
Lemme lemme wear that boy
All this money coming in
But I never share that boy
No lipstick no lashes out
But I got a real big ol' ratchet though
I said dude yo dude you packing out
He said he want good box like Pacquiao
I said well my name Nicki and it's nice to meet ya
If ya really wanna know I give ya my procedure
Got a whole bunch of pretty gang in my clique
And we lookin for some ballers alopecia
I hate wack niggas
I should really slap niggas
These niggas tripping when I put them on the map niggas
How you gonna break that
How you gonna fake that
Ain't at no wedding but all my girls caked high
Sleeping on me no mattress though
Imma burn the beat down no matches though
No they can't keep up they molasses slow
I'm the greatest Queens bitch with the cash's flow
L-L-Looking at me like it's my fault
T-T-Trying take sneak pictures wit their iPhone
I like independent bitches like July 4th
Now that's what young Harriet died for

[Ciara - Hook x2:]
I-I-I'm the shit
With no makeup
Don't have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine

{Nicki Minaj- Verse 1}
Yh,
I coulda been, had fame
Jump shot wid a stupid a** aim
Cuz you couldn't get around the last name
So ma crossover wins the last game
And it's ill right
Switched up the flow but it's still right
Go back to that, yh, I still might
Imma just do me when I feel right
Uh,
You can bring it any day
Natural bad a**, NBA
That's my initials
That's why officials
Don't blow the whistle
Bang, Bang, the pistol
And I'm bossy
Can't keep these hoes up off me
Damn, the flow nasty, Coffee
Don't treat me like the Pope and cross me

{Natasha Bedingfield- Chorus}
It's ma Last Chance
Oooohhh, Last Chance
Yh, this is ma Last Chance
Then Shoot
I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to shoot
I'm ready to shooooooot
I'm ready to shoot

{Nicki Minaj- Verse 2}
I get it in though
No sexual innuendo
Nobody that I can just depend on
Until I touch down in the end-zone
And then they come out like roaches
P-p-p-peck it away like vulchers
But little did they know
Distribute the payroll
Pickup the outfit, Pick up the sandals
Sadly, I'm so business savvy
Similar protocol but the templates vary
Never been like me
Never been like this
My flow's a crisis
They scream in high pitch
Uh,
Gun cock, pause
And I'm well aware of the gun laws
Tell 'em tht I'm runnin for the top floors
Headed to the top dot org

{Chorus}

{Nicki Minaj- Bridge}
All the days of ma life
I have been waiting for this time
Oohh,
Could you believe now it's right before ma eyes
Anybody trying to stop me
Better not f*** wid me this time
Shoot,
I'm ready to shoot into the sky-y-y-y-y-y

{Chorus}

{Natasha Bedingfield}
Only one chance, One bullet in the gun
This is my life and I only got one
Yh,
The safety's off and I put it on stun
Oooohh,
Stick 'em up, Stick 'em up
Ready to shoot

I can be selfish
Yeah, so impatient
Sometimes I feel like Marilyn Monroe
I’m insecure yeah I make mistakes
Sometimes I feel like I’m at the end of the road

I can get low I can get low
Don’t know which way is up
Yeah I can get high, I can get high
Like I could never come down

Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can’t handle my worst
You ain’t getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt

Its like all the good things
They fall apart like…
Like Marilyn Monroe

Truth is we mess up
Till we get it right
I don't want to end up losing my soul

I can get low, I can get low
Don’t know which way is up
Yea I can get high, I can get high
Like I could never come down

Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can’t handle my worst
You ain’t getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt felt felt felt

Take me or leave me
I’ll never be perfect
Believe me I’m worth it
So take me or leave me
(So take me or leave me)
So take me or leave me
(So take me or leave me)

Call it a curse or just call
Me blessed if you can't handle
My worst you ain't getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt
Felt, felt? Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt,
Felt, felt, felt

Is this how Marilyn Monroe

I fly with the stars in the skies,
I am no longer trying to survive,
I believe that life is a prize,
But to live doesn't mean you're alive,
Don't worry bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire it's my empire
And yes I call the shots I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon a vampire, vampire
And this very moment I'm king
This very moment I slay Goliath with a sling,
This very moment I bring
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring,
And I will retire with the crown, Yes!
No I'm not lucky I'm blessed, Yes!
Clap for the heavyweight champ, Me!
But I couldn't do it all alone, We!

[Verse 1:]
Told y'all on Drake's shit, told y'all to fixate
Bitches want my old shit, buy my old mixtape
I ain't fuckin' with you bum bitches no more
Always in the club lookin' like a bozo
Talkin' 'bout money, we could have a conversation
Top five tax bracket in the population
Hatin' and I know they got a reason why
I ain't got to wonder if I want to lease or buy
And I dictate how I'm gonna piece the pie
I ain't talkin' about no muthafuckin pizza pie
Caus' I keep a bad bitch, booty big and the waist thin
Seen his little weiner, but we don't like Nathans
Na, homie you gon' need a bigger cock-pit
Caus when I fly, I be right behind the cockpit
(Aye, yo captian, aye yo cap', I, I don't wanna hear that navigation, baby pa'
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' to get some sleep, ya dig?)

[Chorus]
Oh no we don't play with silly girls

 [Verse 2:]
I'm in the UK but just for one day
Whose to say I won't come back again
Materialistic I'm narcissistic, my shoe game is mean it's so sadistic
I took a learjet to cop some lipstick, yeah I'mma risk it, I'm optimistic
I sip on Ros' you sip your mistake my flows' a biscuit short of a picnic
Okay, Versace Pythons, Louis aviators, Balenciagas and they gotta be the gladiators
Chanel lambskin, vintage Vanson, I'm on the bike doin' wheelies in a mansion
A lot of bad bitches on the pole dancin', Gucci bag just to put the coke cans in
(Hey, yo, Anna, hey yo Anna Wintour, I'ma need that cover baby girl, it's Pink Friday, ya dig)

Oh no we don't play with silly girls

(feat. Drake, Lil Wayne and Chris Brown)

Yo!
I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody, but tape
Yeah, that was a setup, for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt's fake, worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, John & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas, who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me, even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasonin'
And tell 'em bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

I never fucked Nicki, cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought god damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, lowkey it may be high key
I been peeped that you like me, you know
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn’t take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I’m obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that’s right, I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that’s cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck, just give me the heads-up
So I can plan for it
(Pinkprint, AYE!)

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

I never fucked Nicki and that's fucked up
If I did fuck she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin', ain't hittin' it right
Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness like gold is yellow
All my goons, so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up, if she wave
They bet not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? I take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses, with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy my nigga, I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the B out, behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off
Nigga now you see me, nigga now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only

Pills and potions
We're overdosing
I’m angry but I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosing
Can't stand it, but I still love you

I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love

Hey yo, they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doing wasn’t tasteful
Even though you out here looking so ungrateful
I’mma keep it moving, be classy and graceful
I told ‘em it's no friends in the game
You ain’t learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, don’t burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain’t earned that yet
Self-righteous, and entitled
But they swearing on the Bible that they love you
When really they’re no different from all your rivals
But I still don’t wish death on them, I just reflect on them

Pills and potions
We're overdosing
I’m angry but I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosing
Can't stand it, but I still love you

I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love

Yo, people will love you and support when it’s beneficial
I’mma forgive, I won’t forget, but I’mma dead the issue
Soon as you out the nigga's lives is when they start to miss you
They see you doing good now it's kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can’t come and live lavish with you
But I sped off in a Benzy, I see the envy when I’m causing a frenzy
So I pop pills for them, cop cribs in the Hills on 'em

Pills and potions
We're overdosing
I’m angry but I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosing
Can't stand it, but I still love you

I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love

I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
In due time, we'll be fine
In due time...

I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love ---

So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck, I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flatscreen
(Ha ha) Plasma
Hey, Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, Xenocin
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that hoe, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You li'l brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

[Eminem:]
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off, I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off
Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollerin' "Why, God? " He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad
I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch
Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealin' my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera, pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry socket
Kick it back in it's face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not)
The wo-world is my punchin' bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon
You must've went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
I told you to stay in your lane, you just choked in traffic

[Nicki Minaj:]
(I-I-I-I-Is) Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Should've sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'm a wrap your coffin with a bow
(Ni-ni-ni) "Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a stand, still, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' bucked, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
(Manning, Eli!) Ma, ma-ma-ma-ma, Manning, Eli
These bitches callin' me (Manning, Eli)

[Eminem:]
A-a-a-a-all you li'l faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'm a stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if
You have the same passion that I have
Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass
You assdicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!)
Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's (high class) meets (white trash)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Roman! Roman!
Stop it, stop it!
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady!
What's goin' on?
They'll lock you away!
They'll put you in a jail cell!
I promise!
Take your mother's warning, Roman
Pleeeeeeeaseeee
Back to bed! Run along!
Let's go! Come on!
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys

(feat. Chris Brown)

It all comes down to this
I miss your morning kiss
I won’t lie, I’m feeling it
You don’t know, I’m missing it
I’m so dumb, I must admit
It’s too much to hold it in
I can’t say no more than this
I just hope your heart hear me now
Gotta let you know how I’m feeling
You own my heart he just renting
Don’t turn away, pay attention
I’m pouring out my heart oh boy

[Chorus]
I-I, I’m not living life
I’m not living right
I’m not living if you’re not by my side
oooh-ohhh

I-I, I’m not living life
I’m not living right
I’m not living if you’re not by my side
oooh-ohhh

[Chris Brown]
Lets meet at our favourite spot
You know the one, right around the block
From the nice place, that you love to shop
Can you get away?
Care to sit down, lets talk it out
One on one, without a crowd
I wanna hold your hand
Make you laugh again, I need to be near you
Gotta let you know how I’m feeling
Own my heart, and she just renting
Don't walk away, pay attention
I’m pouring out my heart girl

[Chorus (Nicki Minaj + Chris Brown)]

[Bridge]
I can’t eat I-I-I-I
I can’t sleep I-I-I
What I need I-I-I
Is you right by my side

I can’t eat I-I-I-I
I can’t sleep I-I-I-I
What I need I-I-I-I
Is you right by my side

It ain't your spit game, it’s your dick game
That got me walking ’round ready to wear your big chain
I only argue wit’ ‘em when the Lakers on
Other than that I’m getting my Marc Jacob’s on
When my pussy game so cold that he always seem to come back
Cause he know that it’d be a wrap
when I’m riding it from the back
Wait, oh, let me see your phone
Cause all them bitches is ratchet
And now let me get in my truck
Cause all them bitches’ll catch it
Wait wait wait, damn there I go again
I be trippin’, I be flippin, I be so belligerent
Man this shit that we be fighting over so irrelevant
I don’t even remember though I was probably hella bent

[Chorus]

[Bridge]---Lyrics submitted by gloria tejeda.

You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?

[Verse 1]

You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin, you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice, I always hated
But lookin back, it made me greater
You always told me, forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I’m lyin, know when I'm cryin
It’s like you got it down to a science
Why am I tryin, no you ain't buyin
I tried to fight it, back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
From yellin at you, and gettin at you
Pickin up dishes, throwin them at you
Why are you speakin when no one asks you?

[Chorus]

You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?

You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you? (do that)
How do you? (do that)
How do you? (do that)
How do you? (do that)
How do you?

[Verse 2]

What are we doin, could you see through me?
Cause you say Nicki, and I say “who me”
And you say “no you,” and I say “screw you”
Then you start dressin, and you start leavin
And I start cryin, and I start screamin
The heavy breathin, but what’s the reason?
Always get the reaction you wanted
I’m actually frontin, I’m asking you somethin, yo
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin passive aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay you’re right, just let it go
Okay you ride it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You can turn a freak ho to a cold
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul

[Chorus]

You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?

You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you? (do that)
How do you? (do that)
How do you? (do that)
How do you? (do that)
How do you?

[Bridge]

Stop
Stop
Won’t you just stop looking through me
Cause I can’t take it
No, I can’t take it

[Chorus]

You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?

Quack quack to a duck and a chicken too
And put the hyena in a freaking zoo

And this what I do when a bitch breaks flock

No them bitches ain't eating

And yes maybe just a touch of tourettes
Get my wigs parents go and get my beret

[Verse 1]
I guess I went commercial
Just shot a commercial
When I flew to the set though
I aint fly commercial
And the ad is global, yep
Your ad was local
Where we shot it was a lot of different agriculture’s
So I laugh at hopefuls
Nicki pop, only thing thats pop is my endorsement
I, fuck around I have to go and reinforce the glock

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Is it me or did I just put these rap bitches on the map again
You mad cause I’m at the grammy’s with the Vatican
You in the booth, but I’m who you be channelling
Why they never bring your name up at the panel then?
Hottest MC’s, top five!
You need money, I got mine
More knots than Eric from Basketball wives (yaaa dig?)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I couldn’t do your TV show I needed ten more mill
Not 10 on the back, I need 10 on signing
Give that shit to a wash up, bitch I’m winning
If I had a label I would never sign you hoes
Take you bitches to school than I Columbine you hoes
I hear the slick shit, bitch you washed
All you hoes cryin’: Christopher Bosh

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Ayo, now when I tell ‘em it’s Barbie bitch
Yes I really do mean it’s Barbie bitch
Ask Mattel, they auction my Barbie bitch
Raggedy Ann, could never be a Barbie bitch
You at the bottom of the barrel scraping
I’m out in LA, at the Ice Age taping
I’m chillin’ at the top I got ample time
Bite me, apple sign

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]
Kush on my breath, cocaine on my tongue
Eat that pussy make it numb
She can’t feel herself cum
Got a body on my gun
Fuck the world with my thumb
Pop a molly smoke a blunt
That mean I’m a high roller
My ex wanna work it out, bitch try Yoga
Two hoes in the bed, tell ‘em hoe slide over
Excuse my French, two bitches and moi
That’s a Nicki Ménage à Trois
Ha

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]
My shit so cold man, it don’t even stink
Destructive ass nigga, watch me break the bank
Weezy F, and the F is for Fill in the blanks

Back yard bully
And the weed purple like a black girl pussy
Word, middle finger on the trigger
Uh, so you know that mean, fuck a nigga

I am not Jasmine, I’m Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin’
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin’
I’m startin’ to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I’m startin’ to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin’
So f-ck I look like gettin’ back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flatscreen
(Haha) Plasma
Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma
I got the pumps, it ain’t got medicine
I got bars, Xenocin
I’m a bad b-tch, I’m a cunt
And I’ll kick that hoe, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, b-tch, I’m in the front
You need a job, this ain’t cuttin’ it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain’t f-ckin’ with
You li’l brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it’s tough
But enough is enough

Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

(Eminem)
I ain’t into S&M, but my whip’s off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-a-s mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, f-ckin’ pencil for a frame
You don’t like it then peel off, b-tch
Every last woman on Earth I’ll kill off, and I still wouldn’t f-ck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off, I swear to God I’ll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turnin’, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollerin’ “Why, God?” He ain’t got s-it to do with it
Bygones’ll never be bygones, so won’t be finished swallowin’ my wad
I ain’t finished blowin’ it, nice bra
Hope it’ll fit a tough titty, b-tch
Life’s hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my f-ckin’ face and called me a f-ckin’ tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealin’ my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life’s treatin’ you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It’s Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don’t ask why, b-tch (Ask why not)
The wo-world is my punchin’ bag and
If I’m garbage, you’re a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
You musta went off the back, I’m ’bout to go off the deep end
I told you to stay in your lane, you just choked in traffic

(Nicki Minaj)
(I-I-I-I-Is) Is this the thanks that I get for puttin’ you b-tches on?
Is it my fault that all of you b-tches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I’ma wrap your coffin with a bow
(Ni-ni-ni) “Nicki, she’s just mad ’cause you took the spot”
Word, that b-tch mad ’cause I took the spot?
Well, b-tch, if you ain’t s-ittin’, then get off the pot
Got some ***** out in Brooklyn that’ll off your top
I-I-I-I hear them mumblin’, I hear the cacklin’
I got ‘em scared, shook, panickin’
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a stand, still, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I’m the motherf-ckin’ boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my ***** gettin’ bucked, overbite
I see them dusty-a-s Filas, Levi’s
Raggedy-a-s, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These b-tches callin’ me Manning, Eli
(Manning, Eli!) Ma, ma-ma-ma-ma, Manning, Eli
These b-tches callin’ me (Manning, Eli)

(Eminem)
A-a-a-a-all you li’l faggots can suck it
No home, but I’ma stick it to ‘em like refrigerator magnets
And I’m crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who’s back again, b-tch, keep actin’ as if
You have the same pa-sion that I have
Yeah, right, still hungry, my a-s
You a-sdicks had gastric bypa-s
Ain’t hot enough to set fire to dry gra-s
And ’bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!)
Go take a flyin’ leap of faith off a f-ckin’ balcony
‘Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly a-s
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki’s worlds cla-s
It’s (high cla-s) meets (white trash)

Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Roman! Roman!
Stop it, stop it!
You’ve gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady!
What’s goin’ on?
They’ll lock you away!
They’ll put you in a jail cell!
I promise!
Take your mother’s warning, Roman
Please
Back to bed! Run along!
Let’s go! Come on!

[Nicki Minaj:]
I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck, I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flatscreen
(Ha ha) Plasma
Hey, Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, Xenocin
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that hoe, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You li'l brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

[Eminem:]
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off, I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off
Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollerin' "Why, God? " He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad
I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch
Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealin' my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera, pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry socket
Kick it back in it's face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not)
The wo-world is my punchin' bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon
You must've went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
I told you to stay in your lane, you just choked in traffic

[Nicki Minaj:]
(I-I-I-I-Is) Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Should've sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'm a wrap your coffin with a bow
(Ni-ni-ni) "Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a stand, still, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' bucked, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
(Manning, Eli!) Ma, ma-ma-ma-ma, Manning, Eli
These bitches callin' me (Manning, Eli)

[Eminem:]
A-a-a-a-all you li'l faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'm a stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if
You have the same passion that I have
Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass
You assdicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!)
Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?

It's (high class) meets (white trash)

I drove for miles just to find you in my mind
Self only screams all these voices in my head
You gave me strength gave me hope for a lifetime
I never was satisfied

This time won't you save me; this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up
This time won't you save me; this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up

Giving up, giving up (2x)
Giving up

It's not your fault
Ima **** ima monster
Yes Ima beast and I feast when I conquer
But I'm alone on my throne, all these witches
I came this way all this way just to say

This time won't you save me; this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up
This time won't you save me; this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up

Giving up, giving up (2x)
Giving up

I'm giving up baby yes I'm giving up baby
It seems like I've been driving for miles
Yes I'm giving up baby
And I can't seem to silent these voices in my head
This time won't you save me?
Come save me
This time won't you save me?
Come save me

This time won't you save me; this time won't you save me?
Baby I can feel myself giving up giving up
This time won't you save me; this time won't you save me?

[Hook]
On the real nigga, I’m a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter
When I leave niggas, they get real bitter
On the real nigga, I’m a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
(Roll up on ya, r-r-roll up on ya)
(Roll up on ya, r-r-r-r-roll up on ya)

[Verse 1]
8 mil on that new thing, tied up like my shoe string
Ain’t fucking with you bitch niggas, and that’s real rap but I do sing
Make room when I come by, ain’t speaking, I’m dumb high
Just heard niggas got jokes, it’s a matter of time before one dies
‘Cause them dudes out and them two’s out
All sixes like school’s out
Niggas know if they talk slick that I’m winter fresh
They’ll get chewed out
‘Cause them dudes out and them two’s out
All sixes like school’s out
Niggas know if they talk slick that I’m winning fresh
They’ll get chewed out
Their shit ain’t regular rich, so they end up in a ditch
I’m not a regular bitch, so when niggas see me, they jump on my dick
He not a regular shooter, so when you see me, salute her
Ain’t got a knife in my hand, but I’m choppin’ it up with some niggas from Cuba

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ask Jay who he married, 80 thousand in Paris
Stadiums with Queen B and that selfie, got 'em aggy
These bitches is light-weight, I’m always at fight-weight
Wrist game is on ice skate, ‘cause we move work through that Tri-State
‘Cause them boys out, and them toys out
Still banging that noise out
You could get it in the winter-time
Or that Mayweather like Floyd’s out
‘Cause them boys out, and them toys out
Still banging that noise out
You could get it in the winter-time
Or that Mayweather like Floyd’s out
All of these bitches in pocket, I’m ‘bout to make a deposit
Tell ‘em to go ‘head and gossip, as long as your house is the size of my closet
Anybody I call, they picks up, even if they was gettin’ they dick sucked
These niggas don’t make a mix-up, tell ‘em niggas go step they bricks up
Tell ‘em niggas go step they bricks up, (tell ‘em niggas go step they bricks up)

You can suck my diz-nik, if you take this justice
You don’t like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah they know what this is, givin this the business
Cause I pull up and I’m stuntin’ but I aint a stuntman
Yes I’m rockin’ Jordans but I aint a jumpman
Bitches play the back cause they know I’m the front man
Put me on the dollar cause Im who they trust in
Ayo SB, whats the f-cks good?
We ship platinum, them bitches is shipping wood
Them nappy headed hoes but my kitchen good

You can suck my diz-nik, if you take this justice
You don’t like them disses, give my ass some kisses
Yeah they know what this is, givin this the business

Cause I pull up in that Porsche but I aint a Rossi
Pretty bitches can only get in my posse
My name is Roman, last name is Zolanski
But no relation to Roman Polanski
Hey yo, baby bop, f-ck you and your EP
Who’s gassin’ this hoe? BP?
Hmm think, 1,2,3, do the Nicki Minaj blink

Hoes is so crusty, these bitches is my sons

If you cute than your crew can roll
If you sexy eat my Koo-Koo raw
Put ya cape on, you a super hoe

[Nicki Minaj - Verse 1]
This one is for the boys with the booming system
Top down, AC with the cooler system
When he come up in the club, he be blazin’ up
Got stacks on deck like he savin’ up
And he ill, he real, he might gotta deal
He pop bottles and he got the right kind of bill
He cold, he dope, he might sell coke
He always in the air, but he never fly coach
He a muthafuckin trip, trip, sailor of the ship, ship
When he make it drip, drip kiss him on the lip, lip
That’s the kind of dude I was lookin’ for
And yes you’ll get slapped if you’re lookin’ hoe
I said, excuse me you’re a hell of a guy
I mean my, my, my, my you’re like pelican fly
I mean, you’re so shy and I’m loving your tie
You’re like slicker than the guy with the thing on his eye, oh

[Chorus - Ester Dean & Nicki Minaj]

This one is for the boys in the polos
Entrepeneur niggas and them moguls
He could ball with the crew, he could solo
But I think I like him better when he dolo
And I think I like him better with the fitted cap on
He ain’t even gotta try to put the mac on
He just gotta give me that look, when he give me that look
Then the panties comin’ off, off, uh
Excuse me, you’re a hell of a guy you know I really got a thing for American guys
I mean, sigh, sickenin’ eyes I can tell that you’re in touch with your feminine side
Yes I did, yes I did, somebody please tell him who the eff I is

Uh huh, Pretty Gang, Young Money, Cassie---Lyrics submitted by Justin Santiago.

Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, caught cagin' doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?

Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know

Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play here
We're 'bout to play here
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play
The crying game

I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game

Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no easy cash, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya
Not cause I wanna, guess I wanna imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it?
All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and to be loved
(To love and to be loved)

I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone
Cause the tears don't end

Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know

Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play here
We're 'bout to play here
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play
The crying game

I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game

[Verse 1]
Yo, ayo tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted
Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it
Roll that spaceship, we about to get lifted
Lift and the President gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes though

[Pre-Chorus]
I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's ok, we'll take our time

[Chorus]
The night is still young
The night is still young
The night is still young
And so are we
The night is still young
(How dare we sit quietly)
The night is still young
(And watch the world pass us by)
The night is still young
(How dare we sit quietly)
And so are we

[Verse 2]
Ayo, drinks on you, or the drinks is on me
We ain't going nowhere like tanks is on E
We still getting money, what bank it's gon' be?
If he sexy, he planking on me
So when them big boys want all of that (Ay!)
Tell the bartender, say my order back (Ay!)
It's bottle service, he ordered that (Ay!)
Might let him take it home and slaughter that
He got friends for all of my friends
They ain't leaving 'till we say when
And we gon' hangover the next day
But we will remember this day
So drop the pop and get low
Or we can drop the top and just cruise
We fresh to death, down to the shoes
My only motto in life is don't lose

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Bridge] (x2)
We're just getting started, yeah, yeah
We're just getting started, yeah, yeah
Can't you see the night's still early
And we gon' get it wild and crazy

[Chorus]

Yo, he in love with a ghetto girl
He said he want a piece like Metta World
Pat, pat on the kitty cat
He don't mess with them...regulars
He tryna kick it like a ninja
He tryna stick it like syringes
He don't ever play the benches
So I'ma let him touch it if he playin' with some inches

You love when I whine it
You know that I'm sexy
I hope that you ready

Put it in his face like a cop badge
He wanna pound it like a hashtag

If he shoot it up, I'm gonna bust back
Them island girls is the baddest (mm)
American girls run the planet (mm)
South African, European, Asian, Australian
And my Canadian Girls

And how the miniskirt flow

[Pre-Hook: Nicki Minaj]

[Hook: Lunchmoney Lewis---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.

Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm 'bout is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change, all white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and their mood change, like a motherfucker
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you are undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other
Whoop! Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Little Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now?
Uhh, do you hear me?
I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me
I ain't never need a man, to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it

Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank checkin' my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the morning
Cause she gonna say "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move, I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude, what's his name? Not important
I bought some cocaine, you can snort it
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off like chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless and flawless
Smallest regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly; Drake, Tunechi and Barbie
You know---

[Nicki Minaj:]
Docta docta, need you back home, baby
Docta Docta, where you at?
Give me something
I need your love
I need your love
I need your loving
You got that kind of medicine that keeps me comin'

My body needs a hero
Come and save me
Something tells me you know how to save me
I've been feeling weird, oh!
Oh, I need you to come and rescue me

[Chorus:]
Make me come alive
Come on turn me on
Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on

Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on

[Nicki Minaj:]
Oh, you make it, make it right
My temperature is super high
If I scream, if I cry
It's only 'cause I feel alive

My body needs a hero
Come and save me
Something tells me you know how to save me
I've been feeling weird, oh!
Oh, I need you to come and rescue me

[Chorus:]
Make me come alive
Come on turn me on
Touch me, save my life
Come on and turn me on
I'm too young to die
Come on and turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on
Turn me on

[Bridge:]
You've got my life in the palm of your hands
Come and save me now
I know you can, I know you can

D,D,D,D,Don't let me die young, I just want you to father my young
I just want you to be my docta, we can get it crackin' chiropractor, I, I, I, I

I,I,I I know you can save me
And make me feel alive

[Chorus:]
Make me come alive

One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Anyway, lil' nigga don't test the kid
Even Maury Povich couldn't test the kid
Even R. Kelly couldn't touch the kid
And even with all your bars you couldn't text the kid
I got a pool that I never even swam in
Airports that you bitches never land in
They be like what you doing Nicki?
Brandin'
Suck a cockpit, prepare for landin'
I'm brandin', I ain't talking about Presley
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley
Why these bitches so pressed, B?
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B
I'mma violate y'all asses like Chris Stokes
I'm the Sandro, paid on a big boat
Go my way to make a billi like a big goat
Pull my dick out case you bitches get a slick throat

[Hook]
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

One more night for us to burn brighter

One last time for us to go higher

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Won another round, Willin', get the ref
Got the clothing line poppin' and the wigs is next
When I fly you know G5 is the jet
I'm the motherfuckin' Queen, 'lizabeth
Meetings with the president of every network
That is what the fuck I call how to network
My net worth, that net works
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work
Chillin' with executives
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive
Trillion dollar deficit
But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit
B-Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo
This is the Re-Up better cop it while the cost low
F-Flow's sick, I-I'll slap a patient
I'm checkin' these bitches like an application
Cause these bitches trippin', no navigation
So it's off with your head, decapitation
S-S-S-Send em up in flames like a firemen
I do the hirein' and I do the firein'
That boss shit that you talk, I live it
And I'm callin' a travel if you don't stay on your pivot
Bitches

We are going up in flames

Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He can come inside, in my playpen
Cause he look like a superstar in the making
So I think that i'm going in for the taking
Heard through the grapevine that he caking
We could shoot a movie he could do the taping
Boom boom pow, this thing be shaking
I ain't even tryna find out who he dating

Cause I know he gotta wife at home,
But I need just one night alone
If he keep playing them g-g-games
I'mma runaway, I'mma runaway-ay-ay

I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If you looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight and let me do my dance

If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it, you got it, you got that boom boom
If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it, you got it, you got that boom boom

Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He could become my little problem
Cause he look like he modeling clothes in Dublin,
So I think that he gettin' that green-tha-goblin
Heard through the grapevine that he hang low
We could shoot a movie, could bang like Rambo
Boom boom pow, this thing so bingo
Wonderin' if he could understand my lingo

Cause I know he gotta wife at home,
But I need just one night alone
If he keep playing them g-g-games
I'mma runaway, I'mma runaway-ay-ay

I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If you looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight and let me do my dance

If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it, you got it, you got that boom boom
If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it, you got it, you got that boom boom

Boy i'm in this club, slow now
Don't mind if I do
And I can tell you feeling me from the jump,
I wanna ride too
You got that hot sh-t
Boy ya blessed,
Let me feel up on your chest
Flexin', you the man, you the man, one hundred grand
The same power, Game down, guess I play it terribly
Come baby, let there, let me stay there
Lemme show you how I run, take-ya-to-my playground
Come and get this va va voom voom

I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If you looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight and let me do my dance

If you want it, I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it, you got it, you got that boom boom
If you want it,
I'm gonna be va va voom voom
If you got it, you got it,
you got that boom boom---Lyrics submitted by Milan Monroeal.

[Hook: Jeremih & (Nicki Minaj)]
Want some more, want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it, want-want-want some more
{Still want some more} Want some more, want some more
Every time I end up getting it, want-want-want-want some more
(When they start talking crazy that's when I know that they) want some more
(I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it cause I) Want some more
(When they start talking crazy that's when I know that they) Want some more
Every time I end up getting it, want-want-want-want some more

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I'm in this bitch, I'm getting money
One minute they hate me then they love me
Ain't got nothing for me, these dudes is funny
That's why I'm throwing shade like it's sunny
Who had Eminem on the first album?
Who had Kanye saying, "She a problem?"
Who the fuck came in the game made her own cologne?
Who made Lil Wayne give 'em five million?
Why the fuck I gotta say it, though?
You niggas don't know it yet?
Football touchdown on the Boeing jet
You my son, but I'm just not showing yet
Wrist icy, but it ain't snowing yet
You can tell I'm the illest cause my dividend is the biggest
Bitches ain't sitting with us, all my niggas in Margielas (oh!)
Is pigs flying? Is these bitches trying me?
They think it's sweet? Oh, these bitches got diabetes!
You seen that list? It was me, Baby, Jay Z and Diddy

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
(Yo, yo)
I'm in this bitch, I'm high-saditty
I popped a Perc and I said, "thank you"
I'm popping tags everyday, it look like my B'Day
These bitches suck, so I nickname these bitches BJ
They want that union, they want that D-Wade
I tell a ho, "just be happy they getting leeway"
My name Barbie, bitch (my name Barbie, bitch)
Alexander made me Queen
I'm pulling up with the King, I'm late to my own party, bitch
Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing
I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something
I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket
I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it?
Cash money, getting six albums
No bitch niggas on a bitch album
You niggas apologize when a nigga diss you?
That's a big problem

[Verse 1]
I came out looking to party, and now I'm owning that building
You bitches can't get my spot until I start raising some children
These bitches all in they feelings, can't fuck with Nicki, they know it
They know that Nicki a poet, pop me a bottle of Moet
They said I couldn't, but I did it though
Tell 'em I got still that hourglass figure though
Can't stop me, don't watch me, you better just watch your nigga, ho
I'm in that big boy, I am in beast mode
Beast make that G-code
Bitches ain't got drive, these bitches'll get repo'd
I am a monster, this is ambition
This the type of car that you keep a bad bitch in

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Not that I don't got good vision, but I don't see competition
They want me to come and help them, but I am not a magician
I'm on them fo-fours, I'm tipping, you better move out my way
I am not here to play, Pinkprint can't be delayed

[Chorus]
Cause I win again, cause I win again
And I win again, and I win again, and I win again
And I win again, and I win again, yeah, I win again
Can't tell me nothing about it, your opinion is invalid
Go against me, then you made a mistake

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, cause I came out, '09 when promoters brought Wayne out
Lewinsky, like I couldn't get the stain out
I been bad, like cutting school and staying out
I been hotter than vacationing and laying out
I sat back, and watched how it was playing out
They diss me, but running and took the same route
Uh, but no, they not Nicki, wrist on Ice and yes my wrist Bricky
If I leave, the game will miss Nicki
Not a website, but get money, this is 50
Pop bottles with my bitches and get pissy
This shit ain't got no more integrity
Don't write they raps, and plus they flow shitty
Don't make me expose you bitch, I'm too busy
Hopped on the Bridge-y, New York City
Nicki still the queen, niggas all ready
(Hopped on the Bridge-y, New York City
Nicki still the queen, niggas all ready)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Soon as I came in I told them that I would become the greatest
Muhammad Ali all these bitches, and that can't be debated
I never chicken'd, I skated, I know they mad that I made it
All this money I made, all my bitches is laced

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So good, so real, so good, yeah
I'mma win again, I'mma win again, yeah
I'm Meryl Streep to all these bitches, they can't do what I do
Sometimes I just look in the mirror and I be like, "Why you?"
Yeah, I know that they mad
But I'mma shit on my critics some more
I am... I am...
I am still gonna do what he sent me to do
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way

I can't believe

That I can't see you
where are you??
where are you??---Lyrics submitted by Echo Maglasang.

[Verse One]
I used to think that we'd run away.
one lovely, pretty summer day.
i remember when you would say
"we'd be ok, come one may".
I never knew you would lie to me
take everything from inside of me.
your silhouette in the door way.
but before you wake away.

(bridge)

just say goodbye look in my eyes.
so that i always will remember.
frozen in time, always be mine.
baby boy you'll be young forever.
I'll be over here, you'll be over there.
Im'a shed a tear but i really don't care.
Frozen in time, always be mine.
 baby boy you'll be young forever.

[Verse Two]

I used to think that we'd reunite.
I'd be your wife, in the real life.
I thought that you'd come back for me.
and you would take me away.
I never knew only as a teen
You'd reappear, only in my dreams.
your silhouette in the door way.
but before you wake away.


(bridge)

just say goodbye look in my eyes.
so that i always will remember.
frozen in time, always be mine.
baby boy you'll be young forever.
I'll be over here, you'll be over there.
Im'a shed a tear but i really don't care.
Frozen in time, always be mine.
 baby boy you'll be young forever.

[Verse Three]

This is my last cry.
Is this the only way?
this is my own prison.
i'm frozen in in time, in time, in time.

(bridge)

Don't say goodbye look in my eyes.
so that i always will remember.
frozen in time, always be mine.
baby boy you'll be young forever.
I'll be over here, you'll be over there.
Im'a shed a tear but i really don't care.
Frozen in time, always be mine.
 baby boy you'll be young forever.

You'll always be mine.
Frozen in time
Young Forever.---Lyrics submitted by Justyce Santos.

Cuz I'm the one like I'm Tracy McGrady

Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly
Pressed on my chest let me get my cape on
With a certificate that I changed my name on
Na Na Na Name on
