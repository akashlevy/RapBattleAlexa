[Intro: Ghostface Killah]
Damn, damn, ma, we ain't even have to go through it like that
It wasn't even, even that big, man
You know, nah, it's ight though
But anyway, yo, let me get that coat
Let me get those jeans, and let me get that rock on your finger
Oh, it's stuck? Then I'll take the whole finger than, man
Let me get those bags from Paris, and the puppies is staying, yo

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Come through the block, in the brand new Benz
Knowing that me and this dude ain't friends
(Ok girl) Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get your man back like that
Flossin' around, when I'm up in these streets
Knowing that me and this dude got beef
(Ok girl) Yo, what I did was wack
But you don't get your man back like that, no

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, I should just bark on you, burn your car on you
Cuz I'm too much man, to leave a mark on you
You'se a bird you know that, giving that man
Ten points, like he about to blow that
He probably did, you swallow his kids?
In and out of jail, he a snail, he wasn't wilding on bids
In the summertime, I broke his jaw, had to do it, to him
Quick, old fashion, in the back of the mall
Me and him had 'mos forever, like I'm supposed to put him on
When he came home and told on Trevor
Had to bang on homey, ear blocks, out in spots
Throwing them shots, like 'sucker, you know me'
Stop fronting for them people out, side like you really ride
And you a silly chick, thought you was really live
But I guess I was wrong, I'mma holla at dog, and rip his head off word to his bond

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo, I thought we was iller than that, all them kisses
And love yous, when jake came, you hid my packs
It was time a brother went to war, vests banged up
Staining in the kitchen, yo, holding a four
Sweatin' and breathing, bounced out of town for a weekend
Heard you had homey in the passenger seating
Honey, look, I'm a monster don, I do monster things
That's why I put your ass under my arm
Messing with him can bring bodily harm
And where you gonna hide in the streets when the body is gone
If it's one thing I learned that, never trust a female
On no scale, you just confirmed that
Bounce to your momma house, pack your shit
I don't care if you crying, you'se a ruthless chick
Gots to watch you, these eyeballs in my face'll spot you
My girl cousins, they gon' rock you

[Chorus]

[Ne-Yo]
Shorty what is you thinking bout
Didn't I put you down
Flyest whips, rollin' round like yea
That's the bosses chick, on the side
I might of had, one or two
Them silly broads wasn't nothing on you
Rolling with him, try'nna get revenge
That's what you just don't do

[Chorus to fade]

[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
I'm a good dude, you see... yeah.....
Females out there that wanna be
Acting like they getting they little revenge off
Taking it further than what it really is
You know what I mean, playing yourself..
Nahwhatimean... this is Don status, girl
You will have to hold that now..---Lyrics submitted by Mz..

Godzilla bankroll
Stones from Stilion
Yo I ain't got it all, that means I barely home
Trailblazer stay ballin
Revenge is my arts is crafty darts
While y'all stuck on Laffy Taffy
Wonderin' how y'all niggaz get past me
I been doin this before Nas dropped the Nasty
My wallos I did 'em up
Them bricks I send 'em up
My raps y'all bit 'em up
For that now stick 'em up
Ten Four good buddy Tone got is money up
Worth millions still back your bitch lookin bummy what
Ya'll staring at the angel of death
Liar liar pants on fire You burning up like David Koresh
This is architect music
Verbal street opera pop a 'tec man fully got the projects booming indeed
I ran through the tunnel
Terrorize speed
That's when I was still in the jungle slangin that D

[Spoken over the beat]
Get out my face! No you ain't got no mo?'.
Don't need no has been messin' up my corner
And you better get that mad look off your face for I knock it off
Hey fool you ready for another beating
You should have never came back
Look here man after I crucify him, you next!
And you better have a good doctor to rearrange your face
I'm the Champ!

[Ghostface Killah]
Who want to battle the Don?
I'm James Bond in the Octagon with two razors
Bet cha'all didn't know I had a fake arm
I lost it, wild and raw before rap, I was gettin' it on
Took a fat nigga out in like 40secs
My gun get hard wit a 45 still erects and eagle on
Kangol hat slanted coconut bounce to Morocco
Guerilla medallions like Flavor Flav clock yo
Niggaz want me dead but they scared to step to me
Rip they guts out like a hysterectomy
When beef collide look on the flip by the penitentiary kite
Or get you bumped off from the inside
Jaws is hanging
Frauds is leftin they draws on the floor complaining
Bird ass nigga resemble Keenon Ivory Waynes
Stay in your place dirt born rappers get Shadow box for training ?
Ya'll still eatin bacon

[Spoken over the beat]
Think nobody can; don't give this nigga no statue give him death
I told y'all I wasn't going away
You had your shot no give me mine
Now why don't you tell these folks why you been ducking me, politics man
You think you going to keep me down
They don't want me to have the title
Because I'm not a puppet like that fool up there
Ask his woman she get more pipe from the plumber than in bed
I'm the Champ!

[Ghostface Killah]
I like the deuce of diamonds cutting spades on a glass table
Half a mil on my left ankle
Terry cloth Guess shorts robes is comfortable
Bring me a nice bitch that means I'll fuck with you
My swagger is Mick Jaeger stones is rolling
Prestige is cut to it tis ? spark when weed went up
The Cocoa leaf is slightly damp
Sprouting in the backyard next to Gran duke tomato plants
And jets get charted marquee shit with the cars on it
They head and they earl to the toilet and vomit
Back East summer MC king since Cuban
Pretty Tone Iron Man and Bulletproof and Supreme
Proof and you double deuce in the jeans
My man ? was on the floor with the mother load both of them green
IBF WBC Cruiserweight title shots and Rap belts belong to D.C.

[Spoken over the beat]
Listen I am bad, I said I am bad
I'm a bad man
I'm so bad sometimes I's scare myself
Sometimes I look in the mirror and want to kiss myself I'm so pretty
Now who am I (The Man!)
Now who am I (The Man!)
Who (The Man!)
That's right and don't y'all forget it

Ladies and gentlemen!
The winner by consecutive knockout and still champion of the worlllllllld!
Ghostface Killllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa---Lyrics submitted by Bruno.

[Goldie]
Tommy Mattola, lives on the road
He lost his lady, two months ago
Maybe he'll find her, maybe he won't
Oh wonder that love

[Ghostface Killah, (U-God)]
Brothers try to pass me, but none could match me
No girl can freak me, I'm just too nasty
Lost on the dance floors, I attack y'all
Snuck through the back door, guess who they saw?
Goldie and Ghost, black African Rose
Star-studded low lenses, plus the mural was dope
Airbrush W-B's, STOP!
(Shake your body, body)
And cop a couple of these
(She's a hottie, hottie)

[Goldie]
Scottfree and Chauncey, very upset
They're sick and tired of living in debt
Tired of roaches and tired of rats
I know they are over

[U-God]
One in the head, I'm fed, this is how we doin,
Put a Ruff Ryder on my dick, bust right through 'em
Come out your shirt, insert the party rhyme
Fine Dr. Bizerk, Bicardi Lime
We passin it, takes the shake your Calvin Klein
Before the floor gets moist, taste and follow mine
Swallow nine, model dimes from Bahamas
Slim doo-doo makers stuffed inside pajamas

[Goldie, (U-God), {Ghost}]
They'll take all your rhymes with a Colgate smile, hey baby
They'll love you one second, then hate you the next
Oh ain't it crazy baby, yeah
Tony's his name, the undefeated champion, whoa, yeah
(Blow 'em down God)
Now he's alone, he's just the king of his throne
(Yeah, aha)
Always will be my friend, Ghostface Killah
(Truly yours, peace boo)

OOOOO (Ghostface, Ghostface) Killah(x9)---Lyrics submitted by Dashia.

Sometimes I feel like he don't hear me
Sometimes I wonder, do he love me
Life is so hard for me
This ain't the way it's supposed to be
I pray every night asking for forgiveness
Sometimes ask myself is it worth it
Life is so pain, painful
Yet I'm so thank, thankful
Life wont be easy and I know that
My past is over, wish I can go back
Maybe I change-anges
Rearrange-anges
Sometimes times in life we all feel like we are feel like we falling
Those who suffer in life will be rewarded
Lord I hear you but it's so hard being strong
I keep reminiscing all my loved ones that are gone
He says hun you should know you're born to die
I say I do it's just so hard saying bye
That's why, feel like, you don't hear me
Sometimes I wonder, do you love me
Life is so hard for me
This ain't the way it's supposed to be---
