Yeah and it don't stop,

Yeah and it don't quit,

TONY YAYO:

They say good things will happen to those who wait
Shorty stuck in the game still slingin' weight
None of that's yo' life that ten in the brown
For XL six or seven fo' pound

Suede seats is hot but Italian leather is better
And with camera's in the mirror nigga cars costs cheddar
I'm on first class flights with flying cooks
'cause my verse sound nice when they flyin' hooks

Now im blowin' weed-o in Beverly Hills
Some bad free hoes in the Montreal
Next year it's the new Hummer
Stash box with the llama drive through in the blue data bomba

Heaven or Hell will prevail when I'm a goner
'cause I Eat up tracks Like Hannibal and Dahma
I'm the first one out, and last one on the corner
This life is a hustle any day you be a goner

P89 Ruger with the silence off
Little clipper sellin' spitballs goin' through straws
We got plenty of rap sheets but not on sale
We even got dillingers that hold shotgun shells

These rappers is talkin' 'bout bricks in they rhymes
You never did shit but some Mickey Mouse crimes
I don't respect it my work is never watered down
So on the first I get more checks than Nike town

Swingin' 31 Money's I been on the block
Since nigga's did the snake runnin' man in the walk
When I was 15 I didn't want no workin papers
I worked the strip all night, servin' niggers

Listen nigga, We live like Italians in jail
I got CO's bringin' cell phones to my cell
Get rich in the game, niggas out to get you
Fill you ass up with led turn yo' ass to a pencil

I jumped out with the Ruger rapid fire
I had you on the run like Omar on the wire
I'm the only rapper you know that stay on the run
I'm the only rapper you know that stay with a gun

I'm a hustla' OG's love to hate
'cause I got old school money put away in a safe
You can catch me in the hood where that dope and coke at
Or you can catch me in cali in the Hollywood throwback

I'm a bail jumper, you know them fish scale pumper
Fuck judge wong he gon' catch me on the corner
Nigga make poor attacks, homie ya owe me
You wanna rap we can battle for yo' see through rollie

I begin in a mansion stripin' the models
The bathroom's so far you gotta piss in a bottle
There's too many Indians and not enough chiefs
Why you buy all the gun's if you ain't got enough peeps

The shit I spit will cause an all out riot
In my new 4 fifth will cause a hollow tip die
Im the type to tie up your lady, gun butt your baby
Im like the mob nigga fuck you pay me

Im'a hide my assets, and disappear
Make a quick 20 mil and vanish in thin air
I've finished my work now it's time to cop
And meet that Chinese lady at the baggie spot

I Need 12 12's 
And 58 58's
'cause I got 8 sales
And they all gon' wait motherfucka
50 CENT:

Yeah and it don't stop, 
I do a 187 on yo' motherfuckin block 
Yeah and it don't quit,
It's G-Unit in yo' motherfuckin' ass bitch

Yeah and it don't stop, 
I do a 187 on yo' motherfuckin block 
Yeah and it don't quit,

I got that animal (animal) ambition

Why give her love and affection
She just want some bread
I ain't talking of texting
I just want some head
She from a Pirus sip
Where all them niggas wear red
I ain't flying no flags but I'm a gangster bitch
I say say no to drugs then I do that shit
Got a blue fleet of whips
I'm so hood nigga rich
You don't like the way I do it nigga eat your dick
I just call em when I want em don't need your bitch
See my blood on these diamonds everything proper
Your shit look grown and your shit look copper
It's turning homie that's why your turning on me
Admit it I made it, I can't be faded
I roll it up in public I'm a cancer man
Smoke it out in the open like I'm in Amsterdam
I do a hundred miles an hour switching lens in my lane
See my name around the globe niggas know who I am

I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition

You say you hustle like a hustle I be moving shit
Had a couch and a U-Haul filled up with bricks
Got them straps and long clips filled up with led
So when we count on the paper it better come back correct
We out in New Orleans baby niggas hungry for brick
I do that knife for stuntin get shot in the head
Every hood I go through they fuck with me you dig?
Got the eye of the tiger I'm on that animal shit
I got the heart of a lion and the looks of an elephant
Damn scared of rats, but I'm ready for anything
It's the unit my nigga, take a look at my face
See if you test me they'll arrest me I'll be catching a case
New York is a concrete jungle, where niggas got to get paid
Get in the way of that paper and niggas got to get sprayed
Look at me wrong and your dead
You should be very afraid
I don't know how to behave
I'm tamed fresh out the cage
Urrrrrrrrrrhhhh

I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition
I got that animal (animal) ambition

WOO!!!

[Chorus]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!) please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)

If I was your best friend

[Verse 1]
First we get the talkin, then we get the touchin
If we get pass the phone games we'll be fuckin
I kiss like the french therefore my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
For me a different scenery just mean a different position
In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love
But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those
See I see somethin special when I look in your eyes
With your legs way back I see this pussy is mine
If you ain't sure when I'm talkin I don't tell you no lies
But there's things that you say that have me wonderin why
When I don't say what I'm thinkin it don't mean that I'm shy
Got on that shit you picked out for me that's why I'm so fly

[Chorus]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)

Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!) please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!) please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

[Verse 2]
While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
There's a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets
'Fore you end up bein 'round long enough to peep shit
I get closer to you, I mean closer than close
I get into you, after I take off my clothes
Girl I been into you, mentally long before

[Chorus]
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)
Can I be your best friend, if you promise you'll be mine (Girl promise you'll be mine)
Please say he's just a friend (Uh huh) now girl let's not pretend (Come on)
Either he is or he ain't your man (Ha Ha!) please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time (I want you 'round me all the time)

Don't worry 'bout how I get my money, bitch, just know I get my money
Don't worry 'bout I spend my money, boy, I got a lot
Don't worry 'bout that car I drive, don't worry 'bout that bike I ride
Don't worry 'bout them diamonds in that bezel on my watch
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
Don't worry 'bout a mothafuckin' thing
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
We got a strap up in here if niggas playing

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
When time pass and I'm not around, niggas saying I'm out of town
Probably moving them bricks around, they swear they know how I get down
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing
My closet full of that fly shit, black card when I buy shit
Sell the shit you get high with, these niggas on my dick
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing
That's your bitch, I understand, I've seen it all on Instagram
I'm just from the past, I done been all in that ass
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doing, don't worry 'bout what I'm doing

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Don't be worry 'bout my record deals cause I still got my plug
Don't be worry 'bout my bitch pimping, she get money out that club
Don't be worry 'bout my partners and 'em, we get money, we eating
You talk shit 'bout a real nigga, bitch, you must be tweaking
Don't be worried 'bout my whereabouts, money all I care about
Keeping it real in my neighborhood, play with me and I'mma air it out
Why you worry 'bout my money, nigga? Bitch, you think I'm broke?
The Fed worry 'bout what I'm doing, think I'm selling dope
I may be and I may not, go to jail I may rot
I ain't never gon' snitch, nigga, never been no bitch nigga
I got big guns, need a extra large, y'all niggas got question marks
Talking down on a real nigga, that's how you get a hater charged

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Don't worry 'bout what they talking 'bout
Don't tell me what that bitch done said
I'm done with her, you can go with her
I'm leaving here with another bitch
Don't worry 'bout how they look at me
My diamonds on, damn, look at me
These pussy nigga be shooked at me
Wanna judge and throw the book at me
Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it
Had time to talk to my legal team
Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it
Ain't shit they could do to me
Still rocking, still rolling
We holding, bill folding, you know it
When I start to ball out money start to fall out
Throw it up, it fall out the sky
Baddest bitches go all out, whole bar get bought out
That's what I call my lifestyle

[Hook]---

[Verse]
Either I'm trippin' off the ecstasy
Or I could feel the world turnin'
I'm havin' flashbacks, I can feel the shells burnin'
Comin' up, I was taught never back down
That's why I act the way I act now, hold the mac down
32 shots, squeeze til there ain't a shell left
Come with my gun smokin', you can smell death
They get the first laugh, I get the last laugh homie
Hit the gas on it, pull up and mash on 'em
There's a lot of talk in the streets about me
Niggaz know, ain't nothing sweet about me
Get back to questions, like "50, who shot ya?...
You think it was Preme, Freeze or Tah, Tah?"
Nigga, street shit should stay in the street
So, keep it on the low
But everybody who's somebody already know
A few words for any nigga that get hit the fuck up
My advice if you get shot down, is get the fuck up
LET'S GO

Chorus (Different Variations)

[Verse]
Maaaaaaaaan
I told niggaz not to fuck with me they still push me
Figured they'd get away with it cause Tone and Poke pussy
I been gone through static, shot at with automatics
Since 90, when Nas came out with "Illmatic"
If Suge was home, Death Row would be good for me
Cause Tommy Matola ain't shootin out in the hood wit me
I've been shot 9 times my nigga that's why I walk funny
Hit in the jaw once, why I talk funny
With a Ruger on my hip, I walk the street with no care
Think my grandma's prayers the only reason I'm here
My wrist icy, keep my ears icy, keep my neck icy
That's why you bitch like me, so I'm a heavyweight
How dare these niggaz take me lightly?
I ain't come to make friends and niggaz aint gotta like me
My own homie said "50, you done lost yo' mind"
Cause I shootout in broad day, run and toss my nine

Chorus [Different Variations]

[Verse]
Can't find a nigga in the hood, that say "50 ain't hot"
When I drop, I'ma sell like Eminem and Kid Rock
Play the block, with the watch all rocked the fuck up
Jukes me, A week later y'all be shot the fuck up
Born a healthy baby, I wasn't always crazy
This aint how moma rasied me, this how the hood made me
The D's call me by my government name
I be dumb and shoot up parks
Have niggaz runnin' like "Jesus Comin'"
There's wet pillows in prison, niggaz cry in the dark
Cause if they did in the day, niggaz would question they heart
So when they come home, the come home
Walking that tough walk, talking that "Rockavalede"
Talk'll get you shot in New York - BBBBLLLLATTTTT
Sex, money, murder, I gotta eat
But I aint tryin do +Hard Time+ like +Pistol P+
See, niggaz uptown understand me in the street
You niggaz uptown'll "Stan" me in the street
Ha-ha

[Verse]
Either I'm trippin' off the ecstasy
Or I could feel the world turnin'
I'm havin' flashbacks, I can feel the shells burnin'
Comin' up, I was taught never back down
That's why I act the way I act now, hold the mac down
32 shots, squeeze til there ain't a shell left
Come with my gun smokin', you can smell death
They get the first laugh, I get the last laugh homie
Hit the gas on it, pull up and mash on 'em
There's a lot of talk in the streets about me
Niggaz know, ain't nothing sweet about me
Get back to questions, like "50, who shot ya?...

[Chorus (Different Variations)]---

(talking) 
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh 
Southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty south? 
One time 

(Chorus) 
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned 
Over and over again, just to stay on top 
I recall memories, filled with sin 
Over and over again, and again 

Yo, when you hear talk of the southside, you hear talk of the team 
See niggas feared Prince and respected Preme 
For all you slow muthafuckas I'm a break it down iller 
See Preme was a business man and Prince was the killer 
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh 
This here get ya seasick, I sat back and peeped shit 
The roll with Easy Rider and they ain't get blunted 
Had the whole projects workin for fifty on five-hundred 
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack 
I used to idolize cat 
Heart me in my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pat, how he go out like 
that? 
Rumors in the hood was ?? was snitchin 
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSX-R 
Had the four-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3 
Used to drive his truck through the hood draggin jet skis 
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be suprised 
Of how freely I thought of names of games who dealt with pies 
Like L-A-N-Y's, L got shot in the neck, then told us connect 
Them niggas who shot 'em got 'em for ten bricks 
Fuckin Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks 

(Chorus) 

That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on 
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Quran 
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Remmy and Joe 
And Prince and Rightous from Hillside with the mole on his nose 
Throughout my struggles through the hood, I started learnin 
Life's a bitch, with a pretty face, but she burnin 
Man I'm a get cheese like Chaz then run through wips like Cigar 
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tata 
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facin 
Go against crews like B-Bo and killers like Patty Mason 
A lotta niggas I know been corrupted since birth 
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth 
I know some cats that hail at old complexes like Cooley Wall 
Together niggas stand and divided they fall 
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion 
Come around here with your rollie you can get robbed like Ocean 
Lord knows, Tommy had loved and sold 
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louie VaTonne interior 
Might sound like I'm fantasizin, but son I'm dead serious 
Montanna was no dummy, brought Benice to watch the money 
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian 
FEDs couldn't catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion 

(Chorus) 

Yo, rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about yo 
The twins was some queens but got crazy cream with Alpo 
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy, Jamaican Pauly, Ducky 
Cally 
Rodney Bump and Chick, shit 
A lot a niggas flow the way I flow 
but ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know 
Writin rhymes is the best way I express how I feel 
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail 
Comin up I heard sippin to much booze'll leave you confused 
And if you watch the news you see playas in this game that lose 
I'm forgettin Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance 
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags 
And a conversation over shrimp and lobster 
And Benny Hiners heard Chico stopped boxin, and started robbin diners 
Shout out to Clanvis and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will 
If the flow don't kill you the Mac will---Lyrics submitted by BYB.

[50 Cent]
Ya, let's take em back
Uh huh

Comin up I was confused my momma kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing ch-check out my melody
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope for a fo-finger ring
One of them gold ropes
NaNa told me if I pass could get a sheep skin coat
If I can move a few packs and get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning niggas done stole my bike
Different day same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus (50 then Game):]
Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me

Hate it or love it the underdog's on top
And I'm gonna shine homie until my heart stop

Go head' envy me
I'm raps MVP
And I ain't goin nowhere so you can get to know me

[Game]
On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides right above the gold wires
I'll fo-five em
Kill a nigga on my song but really do it
Thats the true meaning of a ~ghostwriter~
10 g'z will take ya daughter out of Air Forces
Believe you me homie i know all bout losses
I'm from Compton where the wrong colors be cautious
One phone call will have ya body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin since my lil nigga Rob got killed for his Barkley's
That's 10 years I told Pooh in 95' I'd kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95s
Told Banks when i met him imma ride
And if I gotta die rather homicide
I ain't have 50 Cent when my Grandmomma died
Now i'm goin back to Cali with my Jacob on
See how time fly?

[Chorus - 50 Cent]

From the beginnin to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in
Is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me nigga now listen to Game

[Game]
Used to see 5-0 throw the crack by the bench
Now i'm fuckin with ~5-0~ it's all startin to make ~sense~
My moms happy she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waitin on Sha Money to land sittin in the Range
Thinkin how they spend 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin
Pac is gone and Brendas still throwin babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's goin on like i hear Marvin
No school books they use that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and i get exhausted
I think what if Marie Banker got that abortion
I love ya Ma'

[Chorus X2]---

[50 Cent]
Ya, let's take em back
Uh huh

[Chorus X2]---

(Like the fire needs the air, i won't burn unless your there, your there. Oooh i need you.
Like the fire needs the air , i won't burn unless your there, your there.)

America got a thing for this gangsta shit, they love me
Black Chuckies, black skullies, leather Pelle-Pelle
I take spit over raymo shit, I'm a vandal
Got the silver duct tape on my 38. handle
The women in my life bring confusion and shit
So like Nino when New Jack, I holla "cancel that bitch"
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggas around me so cold, man my heart done froze
I'll build an empire on the low the narc's don't know
I'm the weatherman
I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dough, watch it go out the door
O after O, you know, homie I'm just triple beam, dreamin
Niggas be schemin, I fiend to live a good life
The fiends are just fiendin
Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me..

[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga you get in my way while I'm tryin get mine,
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga fuck you (fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics I somersault bricks
Black talons start flyin, when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggas can't fuck with me
Man my cold days, they called me chef boy ar 50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their weed, shit
Send me them seeds I'll grow em what they need
Them ain't chia pet plants in the crib, thats chronic
And I'm sellin 'em for 500 a pop god damn it
I sell anything I'ma hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes put in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you'll find is the DNA of a crook and
What goes in my mind, its contagious
Hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or spider, I'll be potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me where ever that dope be, gettin money man

[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga you get in my way while I'm tryin get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga fuck you (fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)

[Verse 3]
It's a hustler's ambition, close your eyes listen, see my vision
Mossberg pumpin, shotgun dumpin' the drama means nothin
It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin lanes
Or in the jewler switchin chains
I upgrade from 30 Bs to clean Vs
Rocks that I copped proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curve and get nauseous, watchin the spinner spin
I make plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Crystal in the blender and make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he ain't got shit on me
The feds watch me, I see they can't stop me
Racist,pointin at me look at the niggaracci
Hello!

[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga you get in my way while I'm tryin get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)

Verse
I hate to say i told you so, but i told you so, i go hard when it’s time to play

Because i got a hell of a flow we got paper to blow my whole clique pop bottles galore
It’s no secret the hood done peeped it when we come through son we look like bread
My ‘89 grind make my old nine shine like we been movin’ bricks ’round this bitch for years

[50 Cent]
Look nigga, if you don’t love yourself
Ain’t nobody gon love you
Your shit ain’t right
what bitch in her right mind gon’ fuck you
That’s what they told me then
So I was like "fuck a bitch"
Bitch Imma grind, Imma shine, everytime blow they mind
Oh now she like me, oh oh oh now they like me
All I want is a blow job
This bitch wanna be wifey
No 3-course meal, all I want is fast food
I wanna have fun, how about a cookie huh?

[Hook]
I don’t wanna love you
I just wanna unbutton your blouse
And let the girls out
I wanna fuck you
Maybe later on, if you’re free
You can come to my house
Only if you want to
We can get freakier and freakier than
You’ve ever been, if you want to
We can get freakier and freakier
You can bring a friend

[Tony Yayo]
Bitches from Belize, keep all in the weed
Remy crew got me sweating out a remi weave
Fuck a model tonight, my bitch is from the
She the project pimp tease
Them hood bitches always bring back memories
They all catch the makers like "Yayo you remember ME?"
I certainly do, pull the curtain on a ’62
Hands was free, she on her menstrual
I promise I don’t love em, I don’t cuff em
I don’t pay a bitch’s rent to have the next nigga fuckin’
I’m a pimp with principles
Killin with visuals
My diamonds like

[Hook]

[50 Cent]
I don’t want a relationship, I just wanna have fun
In every position, we can come up with til we’re done
And my request is to be kickin shit in my ear
Like to hear what you're thinking, after laughing and drinking
We can have a ball, we can do it all
Moonshine light up the sky at night time
Any time could be the right time
I’m sort of impulsive, I’m kinda explosive
Me, Take a little at a time in doses
Once you’re addicted, I just wanna kick it
You could pick the spot, I’ll be there with the quickness
Give it to you good, when I’m gone I’m sure you gon miss this

[Hook]---

[50 talking] 
Hold up. Son, them niggas know who hit that nigga son. (I know I kno...) 
How the fuck we gon know who hit em, and they don't know who hit him. 
The hood talkin man everybody know. (I know its fucked up) 

Now I lay thee down to sleep, niggas tryin' to lay me down wit heat, if I should die do' before i awake i pray my lord my soul to take... 

[Verse 1] 
If dead men could talk in your sleep 
And your homie told u who got him 
Would you have the heart to shoot the nigga that shot him 
Or would you start switchin up 
You think about the penitentiary, your bitchin up? 
What if he said money aint everything 
The hood raised us wrong 
What it takes to get your money long 
But look I'm gone 
Would that touch your heart have you feelin funny inside 
Would that be enough to make your punk ass ride 
What if he gave you a lil list of things to do 
Said he wouldn't have to die 
He could live through you 
Would you load your gats and get ready ro ride 
Or would you lock the door at your crib and hide 
It's a cold world even when it's hot outside 
Wether sunshine or rain, you still feel pain 
Hit him cause he was your strength 
Now you in a daze 
Your homie turnin over in his grave 
Cause you PUSSY! 

[Chourus] 
Ya know who killed him! Ya know who killed him! 
Ya know who killed him! (Ride!) 
Ya know who killed him! Ya know who killed him! 
Ya know who killed him! (Ride!) 

[Verse 2] 
Them boys smoked your homie 
You aint gon do nothin back 
Not even if he told you, you next to get clapped 
It don't take much for them shells to make the best of you 
Your peoples probably gon cremate and burn the rest of you 
You done did too much dirt to try and make it to heaven 
Nigga is you down for this 1-8-7 
When you reach the pearly gates 
How you gon explain 
You gonna try and tell God you've been framed 
Ya'll did everything together, he was your dog 
Now you uptown coppin and he in the morgue 
Them niggas he gave pacs to they kept the cake 
His sister and baby momma talkin to Jake 
Da' niggas that rocked him they came to the wake 
But they come inside they sat out in the ride 
At the funeral homicide all in the buisness 
Walkin round askin niggas to tell em who did it 
Niggas is throwin' blows now you ready to rumble? 
Thirsty niggas an animal, the hood is a jungle 
Broke nigga will body someone over a bundle 
Man a three year old kid in my hood know what a gun do

When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dance floor packed, thats without a doubt

Wish death upon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

Now these pussy niggas putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt, that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, something special happen every time
I'm the greatest, something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
Show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper nigga, go'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me

Sunny days wouldn't be special, if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good, if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This if for my niggas on the block, twisting trees and cigars
For the niggas on lock, doing life behind bars
I don't see only god can judge me, 'cause I see things clear
Quick these crackers will give my black ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means, with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die homie?

Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me

Every night I talk to god, but he don't say nothing back
I know he protecting me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pulling techs on me
Psych says some bitch done, put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much, when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me, Tuck got knocked
I ain't gonna spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate nigga? You can't read between the lines
In the bible it says, what goes around, comes around
Hommo shot me three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here, for a real reason
'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fucking breathing

Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me---Lyrics submitted by Roy.

(Adam Levine) 
My life, my life 
Makes me wanna run away 
There's no place to go, no place to go 
All the confusion 
It's an illusion like a movie 
Got nowhere to go 
Nowhere to run and hide 
No matter how hard I try 

(50 Cent) 
Yeah, OP, I went from back filthy to filthy rich 
Man, the emotions change so I can never trust a bítch 
I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit 
Right in my face, so Game and Buck, both can suck a dick 
Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit 
Cause I'm not writing anymore, they not making hits 
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned 
If money is evil look at all the evil I done earned 
I'm doing what I'm supposed to, I'm a writer, I'm a fighter 
Entrepeneur, fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver 
What's it to you? The track I lace it, it's better than basic 
This is my recovery, my comeback, kid

(Eminem) 
While you were sipping your own kool-aid getting your buzz heavy 
I was in the fücking sheds chopping my machete 
Sipping some of of that revenge juice, getting my taste buzz ready 
To whoop down this spaghetti, or should I say this spaghett-even? 
I think you fücking meatballs keep on just forgetting 
Party was finished, motherfücker, it's only the beginning 
He's bugging again, he's straight thugging, fück who he's offending 
He'll rip your vocal chords out and have them bítches plugged in me 
Motherfücking wall with 3000 volts of electricity 
Now take the other and dump them then pluck him, motherfückers in each 
One of your eyesockets cause I thought you might finally fücking see 
That'll teach you to go voicing your cocksucking opinion to me 
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit 
Fück letting up, you're gonna end up regretting you ever betted against me 
Feels like I'ma snap in a minute, yeah, it's happening again 
I'm thinking about the same motherfücker 
That everybody else that's up in this bítch, what 50? 
Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go 
I swear to God I put my heart and soul into this more than anybody knows 
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap but everytime I rap I'm on track 
And I rap myself right into this bubble, oh oh, I guess it's bubble wrap 
This is like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis www.eliterics.com 
Christ, how was I supposed to know shut would turn up like it did? 
Feels like I'm going psycho again and I might just blow my lid 
I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid 
Cause I'm running in circles with

Nowhere to run and hide

(50 Cent) 
I haven't been this fücking confused since I was a kid 
Sold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did 
Maybe this is for me, maybe, maybe I'm supposed to go crazy 
Maybe I'll do it 3 AM in the morning like Shady 
Psycho killer, Michael Myers, I'm on fire like a lighter 
Tryna say the same classic, get your ass kicked 
Man crook, wrap your head up in plastic 
See, now I'll pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots 
It's tragic, it's sad it's never gonna end, now we number one again 
With that frown on your face and your heart full of hate 
Accept it, respect it, this a gift God gave me like the air in the lungs 
And every fücking thing with it

My life, my life

[Intro:]
Okay okay okay
[screwed] Okay okay okay
Okay okay okay
[screwed] Okay okay okay

[Chorus:]
When they talk about me they say I be trippin (yeah)
What they say about me doesn't make me mad (naw, naw)
I think they hatin cause they see me when I'm rollin (yeah)
Man I can't help it that they really doin bad (naw, naw)
Okay, alright (they sick)
Okay, you're right (I'm rich)
Okay, alright (I grind)
Okay, you're right (for mine)

[Verse 1:]
I'm in that 760 leanin when I'm stuntin
I blow 50 G's, I mean with ease like this is nothin
Please don't interrupt me when I'm talkin to my jeweler
He's puttin them diamonds all over my Franck Muller
Me I get busy, I put that work in if it's worth it
Come through hit you up, I'll make a crime scene perfect
Niggaz talk about me all the time behind my back
They don't talk about me in my face because I'm strapped
See me in the club, I got that Henny and that 'gnac
A couple cups of that and I just don't know how to act
[ 50 Cent Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ] 
By the second bottle that's when I just get to buzzin
I say I run New York and ain't nobody sayin nothin (okay okay okay)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
I blew a hundred G's on my bitches in Miami
They think I'm the sweetest thing invented since candy
Me I catch amnesia when you ask me 'bout the shotty
I don't even know my name, switchin lanes in my Bugatti
Nigga I ain't crazy, bitches like me cause I'm paid
They want me, LeBron, Kobe or Dwyane Wade
When I say I'm ballin I'm not talkin 'bout a ball
I'm talkin 'bout Tiffany & Co. stones out the mall
Niggaz they can hate all they want but they know they like this
Me I'm like that paintin on the wall, baby I'm priceless
You could come and work me over baby on the night shift
Catch me on the night shift, see how freaky I get (okay okay okay)

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Okay okay okay okay - sho' you right
Okay okay okay okay - you know you right
Okay, alright, okay, alright
