'Cuz all around the world, people want to be loved (yeah)
'Cuz all around the world, they're no different than us (you know, you know, you know)

All around the world, people want to be loved

[Ludacris]
Yeah
Okay
Once again
(All around the world)
The dynamic duo is back at it
JB, Luda!
I love everything about you, you're imperfectly perfect
Everyone's itching for beauty, but you're scratchin' the surface
Lost time is never found, can the dj please reverse it
In life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
Anything can work, if you workin with people saying you don't deserve it
Then don't give in, 'cuz hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you
So you like that?

[Bieber]
All around the world, people want to be loved
All around the world, they're no different than us

All around the world
(All around the world, people wanna be loved)
All around the world
(All around the world, they're no different than us)
All around the world
(All around the world, people wanna be loved)
All around the world
(All around the world, they're no different than us)

All around the world ---

It’s another, if it ain’t one thing
Instigators, like pouring fire on propane
The wrong thing, they be worried about
Ooh, you know females
And how they like to run their mouths

Wanna be, wanna be, just like, talk like, you
(like you) you (like you)
Misery, misery, best company
Don’t let them change your mood

[Chorus]
They try to get at me (They try to get at me)
Behind your back (your back, your back)
Tryin’ to tell me that I’m just like the others
But I ain’t all bad

No, no, I ain’t all bad
All bad, all bad
I ain’t all bad
All bad, all bad

I might make you mad, so mad
My bad, no, I ain’t all bad

[Verse 2]
Between us, they wanna comment
Your worst enemy some time be your best friend
Perfect, ain’t saying that I am
Proven, it’s proven I don’t give a damn

Wanna be, wanna be everything I ought to be to you (to you)
Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy
Jealous of you
That’s what they do

[Chorus]
They try to get at me (They try to get at me)
Behind your back (your back, your back)
Tryin’ to tell me that I’m just like the others
But I ain’t all bad

No, no, I ain’t all bad
All bad, all bad
I ain’t all bad
All bad, all bad

I might make you mad, so mad
My bad, no, I ain’t all bad---

Yeahh....

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There's just one thing I need 
I don't care about presents 
Underneath the Christmas tree 
I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true... 
All I want for Christmas 
Is you... 

I don't want a lot for Christmas 
There is just one thing I need 
I don't care about presents 
Underneath the Christmas tree 
I don't need to hang my stocking 
There upon the fireplace 
Santa Claus won't make me happy 
With a toy on Christmas day 
I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true 
All I want for Christmas is you... 
You baby 

I won't ask for much this Christmas 
I won't even wish for snow 
I'm just gonna keep on waiting 
Underneath the mistletoe 
I won't make a list and send it 
To the North Pole for Saint Nick 
I won't even stay awake to 
Hear those magic reindeer click 
'Cause I just want you here tonight 
Holding on to me so tight 
What more can I do 
Baby all I want for Christmas is you 
You... 

All the lights are shining 
So brightly everywhere 
And the sound of children's 
Laughter fills the air 
And everyone is singing 
I hear those sleigh bells ringing 
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need - 
won't you please bring my baby to me... 

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas 
This is all I'm asking for 
I just want to see baby 
Standing right outside my door 
Oh I just want him for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true 
Baby all I want for Christmas is 
You... 

All I want for Christmas is you baby... (repeat)---Lyrics submitted by Megan Downs.

Sitting here, all alone watching the snow fall
Looking back at the days we threm them snow balls

And I'm sorry  if I pushed you away

Don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

If you got a twenty for all of your tries
Twenty for all of the times, the times you got back up, woah
You'd be a billionaire in a year
That's what you gotta think 'till you're there, on the regular.

If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Still don't condone it, love is a component
You're the only opponent, gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Gonna give each time
Said it won't hurt my side
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

All in it, all in it

Ever had a good time easy five strings?
A guitar with only one string, I can only play one song, ooh
A simple melody, simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing, you know what I mean

If you got a diamond for all of your passion, diamond for your dedication
You could be icy like cake and icy for every occasion, gotta go hard, yeah
Still don't condone it, love is a component
You're the only opponent, gotta seize the moment

And don't do nothin' 'less your heart's in it
Heart's in it, heart's in it
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it
Gonna give each time
Said it won't hurt my side
Don't do nothin' 'less you're all in it
All in it, all in it

All in it, all in it

See growing up I...
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
Because I, I just didn't think I wasn't good enough
And maybe if I was good at something, that I'd get recognition from that
But I quickly found out that, I wasn't going to get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed
Because, because people aren't perfect
And, by not being perfect you, you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God, it's like He's perfect and He never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from Him
And give Him recognition---

Oh-oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to shine in the light
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long long time
Better believe it
Uh-oh, whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missin' my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
'Til you're back again, oh, yeah, yeah

You think I'm biased
To my significant other
You hit it right on the head
Only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone and I don't reply
But the next day bothers you, why

You're all that matters to me
Yeah yeah, ain't worried about nobody else
If it ain't you, I'm not myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me
Yeah, yeah, what's a king bed without a queen
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me

Take the gas out the car it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you, and only you
Uh-oh, I'm grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart, please believe

You're all that matters to me
Yeah yeah, ain't worried about nobody else
If it ain't you, I'm not myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me
Yeah, yeah, what's a king bed without a queen
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all that matters to me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You're all that matters to me---Lyrics submitted by Jasminbieber.

As long as you love me [x3]

[Verse 1]
We're under pressure,
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together,
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl,
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances

[Chorus]
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love, love, love, love me ( x2 )

[Verse 2]
I'll be your soldier, fighting every second of the day for your dreams girl
I'll be your whole world
You can be my Destiny's Child on the scene girl
So don't stress, don't cry, we don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand

[Bridge]
As you love me we could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love, love, love, love me ( x2 )

[Big Sean]
I don't know if this makes sense, but you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, and I'll rendezvous, and I'll fly you to it,
I'll beat ya there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust...
A couple of things I can't spell without you
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's our point of view
now we stepping out like wow (Oh God)
Camera's pointed shoot,
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you
You, you the one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with,
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side,
It's green where you water it
So I know we got issues baby true true true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me

[Chorus]
As you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love, love, love, love me ( x6 )
As long as you love me---Lyrics submitted by Bouvonna.

Luda, When I was 13 I had my first love,

She had me going crazy, oh I was star-struck,
she woke me up daily, don’t need no Starbucks.
lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
She made my heart pound, I skip a beat when I see her in the street and
at school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.
She knows she got me dazing coz she was so amazing
and now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying….

(feat. Lil Wayne)

You said "I come in peace", so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythm's on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone

You don't know what they're like if they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen (listen, listen)

Don't try to find your spaceship
That might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet's outside there waiting
I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack, backpack, backpack

Before you came around I was in a rut
Didn't have a friend, didn't know what it was
You taught me how to dream and how to love
You're my best friend, please listen to me

You don't know what they're like if they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen (listen, listen)

Don't try to find your spaceship
That might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet's outside there waiting
I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack, backpack, backpack

[Lil Wayne:]
Uh, greetings, I fell from the sky
I'm from a different world, I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And my flying saucer crashed, I'm the only one that survived
I've only taken over this planet since I've arrived
I'm in the backpack, I'm ducking Men In Black
Yeah I'm an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die they gon' name this planet after me
Wayne's world (wayne's world, wayne's world)

[Justin:]
Don't try to find your spaceship
That might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship
My planet's outside there waiting
I can't stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack, backpack, backpack

On our planet we don't kill one another
We don't take love for granted, it's a gift from the mother
In, in your planet you are filled with greed and false belief
We came here to bring you peace---

No I didn’t think you would let me down that easy (oh no, girl)
And I didn’t think it was over
Until you walked away
Like it was nothing, baby

And that moment was so hard for me to breathe
‘Cause you took away the biggest part of me, yeah
Life is so unpredictable

Never thought a love like yours could leave me all alone (oh no)
Didn’t waste any time
Like you had already made up your mind
No sympathy
‘Cause I was out of line (oh, yeah)

But I didn’t think you would let me down that easy (oh no, girl)
And I didn’t think it was over
Until you walked away
Like it was nothing, girl

It was a bad day (hey, yeah, yeah)
I know I was wrong
But you could have said “goodbye” baby
It was a bad day
Now I’m like, “wow”

It was a bad day
It was a bad day
It was a bad day---

Across the ocean, across the sea,
Starting to forget the way you looked at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky,
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes

Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps on the road and upside down now
I know it's hard, babe, to sleep at night
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

All alone, in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles,
To be in your arms, holding my heart

Oh I,
Oh I,
I love you
And everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
I promise I will stay right here, yeah

I know that you want me too,
Baby we can make it through anything
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
'cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight

Through the sorrow, and the fights,
Don't you worry
Everything's gonna be alright ---Lyrics submitted by victoria moreno.

Young Money, Nicki Minaj, Justin

Show you off, tonight I wanna show you off
What you got, a billion could've never bought
We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, be young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all by you, when the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do
Cause...

[Beat break]

Body rock, girl, I can feel your body rock
Take a bow, you on the hottest ticket now

Baby do it like you do

[Nicki Minaj]
In time, ink lines, bitches couldn't get on my incline
World tour, it's mine, ten little letters, on a big sign
Justin Bieber, you know I'mma hit 'em with the ether
Buns out, wiener, but I gotta keep my eye out for Selena
Beauty, beauty and the beast
Beauty from the east, beautiful confessions of the priest
Beast, beauty from the streets, we don't get deceased
Every time a beauty on the beats
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, Let's go, Let's go)

Body rock, girl, I can feel your body rock
Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all by you, when the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do
Cause...

[Beat break]---

Feeling the remnants, got it in an instance
Blink of an eye, no goodbye
I had a notion deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky, oh my

Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Prayed our love wasn't vain
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?

If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnants
No, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you

There are percussions, I'm missing your loving
Must be the night, the ghost of a life
All of the memories
A serenity dwindling my mind
All the time

Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Prayed our love wasn't vain
Who was to blame for all the pain? For all the pain?

If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnants
No, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you

If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your remnants
No, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you---

Believe, believe, believe

I don't know how I got here
I knew it wouldn't be easy
But your faith in me was so clear
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
But you knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at me now

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if you didn't believe
Believe...

There were days when out you spoken, you know
There were night when I was doubting myself
But your kept my heart from falling
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
But you knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at us now

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if you didn't believe

[Gospel]
Where would I be, if you, if you
If you didn't believe
Would you know, how I feel
Touch the sky, if you didn't believe
Believe, believe

It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor
You knew one day I would be standing tall
Just look at us now

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me

Cause everything starts from something
But something would be nothing
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me
Where would I be, if you didn't believe

[Gospel]
Where would I be, if you
If you didn't believe
Would you know, how I feel
Touch the sky, if you didn't believe
Believe, believe

Where would I be, if you didn't believe ---

[Verse 1]
Gotta believe in me 
Believe me like a fairytale
The tooth under your pillowcase 
And know I won't I won't
Ever, ever let you down (No)
Like a See-sa into town
You know why
Cuz we ain't on the playground no more

[Pre]
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little 
but now I'm bigger I'm bigger

Cuz we're bigger, love's bigger, I'm bigger and you're bigger

[Verse 2]
Whoa oh
I remember when my heart was young
You were still bigger than me
Is that the reason that you stayed
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bullies in the school yard
Can't take my hugs and my kisses are from her
When ain't pushovers no more baby

[Pre]
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little 
but now I'm bigger I'm bigger

And all the haters I swear
They look so small from up here
Cuz we're bigger, love's bigger, I'm bigger and you're bigger

[Verse 3]
(Remember those stroll down street) I remember that
(Don't like Edle Lane?) Like Yesterday
(They shine on me) We were little then
(In class I dreamed about you) My baby
You wow wow (You wow wow)
Since then all I can remember is the love only got Bigger

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little 
but now I'm bigger I'm bigger
A heart-breaker when I was little
but now I'm bigger I'm bigger
And all the haters I swear
They look so small from up here
Cuz we're bigger, love's bigger, I'm bigger and you're bigger

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little 
but now I'm bigger I'm bigger
A heart-breaker when I was little
but now I'm bigger I'm bigger
And all the haters I swear
They look so small from up here
Cuz we're bigger, love's bigger, I'm bigger and you're bigger---

If I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go
I can take you places you never been before
Baby take a chance or you’ll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I’d really like to blow
Swag swag swag, on you

The sun comes up on another morning
My mind never wakes up without you on it
And it's crazy to me, I even see you in my dreams
Is this meant to be? Could be happening to me?

We were best of friends since we were this high
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by
We would be on the phone all day
Now I can't find the words to say to you
Now what I'm supposed to do

Could there be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby now is time for us
Shall I give it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings

In my head we're already together
I'm good alone, but with you I'm better
I just wanna see you smile
You say the word and I'll be right there
I ain't never going nowhere

I'm just trying to see where this can take us
Cause everything about you girl is so contagious
I think I finally got it down
Now it's left to do now, lets get out the mirror
And say it to her

Could there be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby now is time for us
Shall I give it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings

Should I tell her, how I really feel
Or should I move closer or just be still
How would I know?
Cause if I take a chance, and I touch her hand
Will everything change?
How do I know, if she feels the same?

Could there be a possibility
I'm trying to say what's up
Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby now is time for us
Shall I give it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings

Catching feelings, catching feelings....---Lyrics submitted by alyssa nychole.

Girl, I’m ready, if you’re ready, now
Ooh, as I’m ever gonna be
If you’re with it, then I’m with it, now
To accept all responsibility
I’d go out of my way
To live by the words that you say
I don’t wanna be the same

Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me

Maybe you could be the light
That opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right
Change me, change me

Don’t fight fire with fire
If I’m screaming, talk quieter
Understanding and patience
Feel the pain that I’m facing
Be like serenity
Help reposition my mind
Take a chance
Make a difference in my life

Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me

Maybe you could be the light
That opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right
Change me, change me

Girl, I’m ready, if you’re ready, now
Ooh, as I’m ever gonna be
If you’re with it, then I’m with it, now---

Baby I will not pout
Baby I will not cry
Cause I got your love this Christmas time.
When the snow's on the ground
And it's freezing outside
I got your love this Christmas time.

On every list I've ever sent
You're the gift I'd love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest, warm me up
With your Christmas love

Hey angel in the snow
I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one for my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year
My present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas Love

Like a beautiful tree, you can light up the room
But your kind of star can't be removed
Like a beautiful carol, I get lost in your song
And I will forever sing along

On every list I've ever sent
You're the gift I'd love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest, warm me up
With your Christmas love

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yule-tide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies for his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you!

Just a fraction of your love 
fills the air, 
And I fall in love with you, 
All over again, 
Oooo, 
You're the light that faced the sun, 
In my world, 
I'd face a thousand years of pain
For my girl.

Out of all the things in life, 
That I could fear, 
The only thing that would hurt, 
Is if you weren't here, 

I don't want to go back
To just being one half of the equation
You understand what I'm sayin'?

Girl with out you I'm lost
Can't face this focus at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator, oh, oh, ohh, oh
You're the common denominator, oh, yeah, woah

Before your love was low
Playin' girls was my high, aye
We chase the game that would put
My cot in the side

Broken heart rise up to say
Love is a lie,
You and I would stand
To be multiplied, yeah

Out of all the things in life, 
That I could fear, 
yeah
The only thing that would hurt me, 
Is if you weren't here, 
Woah

You're the common denominator, oh, yeah, woah

I can't imagine life 
without your touch, 
Every kiss that you give, 
It gives me heart, 
And to all the heart it can, 
Jealous females hate it, 
I'ma hold it down for you, 

For you, woah, oh woah, 
Common denominator, 
Oh, yeah, woahh, 
I don't wanna to go back, 
Half of the equation, woah woah yeah,

Can we, we keep, keep each other company
Maybe we, can be, be each other's company
Oh company

Let's set each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my ring
Tell me what you wanna drink
I tell you what I got in mind
Oh I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change

You ain't gotta be my lover for you to call me baby
Never been around no pressure, ain't that serious

Can we, we keep, keep each other company
Maybe we, can be, be each other's company
Oh company

It ain't about the complications
I'm all about the elevation
We can keep it goin' up
Oh, don't miss out on us
Just wanna have a conversation
Forget about the obligations
Maybe we can stay in touch
Oh that ain't doin' too much

You ain't gotta be my lover for me to call you baby
Never been around no pressure, ain't that serious no

Can we, we keep, keep each other company

Think she foreign, got passports
Mi amor started slow, got faster
She gon’ work some more, work some more
No stopping her now, no stopping her now

Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets
What’s your nationality? I wonder if there’s more of you
She’s got my attention, she’s confident

Oh no no, oh no no
She’s confident
Oh no no, oh no no
And I’m down with it
Oh no no, oh no no
She’s confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room

She said it’s her first time
I think she might of lied
Feels so good damn, and I don’t know why
I’m addicted, something like a headache
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it
Explosive, explosive (I could still smell her perfume)
It’s not hard to notice, that I’m open
Hypnotized by the way she moves

Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What’s your nationality? I wonder if there’s more of you
She’s got my attention, she’s confident

Oh no no, oh no no
She’s confident
Oh no no, oh no no
And I’m down with it
Oh no no, oh no no
She’s confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room

She said it’s her first time
I think she might of lied
Feels so good damn, and I don’t know why
I’m addicted, something like a headache
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it

[Chance the Rapper]

She said it’s her first time
I think she might of lied
Feels so good damn, and I don’t know why
I’m addicted, something like a headache
Got me twisted, but still I gotta have it

Still I gotta have it
Still I gotta have it
Still I gotta have it
Oh no no, oh no no
Oh no no, oh no no
Oh no no, oh no no
Oh no no, oh no no
But still I gotta have it---

Say you love me, as much as I love you, yeah
Would you hurt me baby
Could you do that to me, yeah
Would you lie to me baby?
‘Cause the truth hurts so much more

Would you do the things that drive me crazy,
leave my heart still at the door? 

Oh I can’t help it I’m just selfish
There’s no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is 

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn’t mind
‘Cause everytime you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh but it feels so right
So baby baby baby please don’t stop, girl

Oh, Baby, I know loving you ain’t easy
But it sure is worth a try

Ooh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
‘Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules, baby?

If this is a lesson
Baby teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do
Just to stay right next to you

Oh I can’t help it I’m just selfish
There’s no way that I could share you
That will break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is 

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn’t mind
‘Cause everytime you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh but it feels so right
So baby baby baby please don’t stop, girl

Basically I’m saying here
I can’t live without my baby
Loving you is so damn easy for me

Ain’t no need for contemplating
Promise me you won’t keep me waiting
Tell me baby I’m all that you need

If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn’t mind
‘Cause everytime you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh but it feels so right
So baby baby baby please don’t stop, girl

If I could die in your arms
(I’mma make you believe girl)
I wouldn’t mind
Aye, Aye, Aye
Whooooa
If I could baby, oh! 
It’s what you do to me
Whooa, no no
Baby please don’t go girl
Nooo, Nooooo
No, no, no, no---

I never thought it would be easy
Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart

(Refrain)
So we fight (so we fight)
Through the hurt (through the hurt)
And we cry (and cry and cry and cry)
And we live (and we live)
And we learn (and we learn)
And we try and try and try and try
So its up to you 
and its up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)

Mommy you were always somewhere
And daddy I live outta town
So tell me how i can ever be normal somehow
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me why am I in tears
So far away and now i just need you

(Refrain)
So we fight (so we fight)
Through the hurt (through the hurt)
And we cry (and cry and cry and cry)
And we live ( and we live)
And we learn (and we learn)
And we try and try and try and try
So its up to you 
and its up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)

We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and where do we go
When there's no road
to get to your heart
Let's start over again

So its up to you 
and its up to me
That we meet in the middle 
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth

I never thought it would be easy
Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wonder how...---Lyrics submitted by Sydneye.

[Justin:]
Come they told me pa rum pa pum pum.
A newborn king to see, pa rum pa pum pum.
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pa pum pum.
To lay before the king, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum.

Rum pa pa pum, rum pa pum pum pum pum.
Yeah I'm on the drum, yeah I'm on the snare drum.
Yeah I'm on the beat cause the beat goes dumb.
And I only spit heat cause I'm playin' for the Son.
Playin' for the King, playin for the Title,
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible.
I'm so tight, I might go psycho.
Christmas time so here's a recital.
I'm so bad like Michael, I know I'm still young but I go I go.
Stupid stupid love like cupid,
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it.

Little baby, pa rum pa pum pum.
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pa pum pum.
[Busta:]
Gather round the mistletoe real quick.
[Justin:]
I have no gifts to bring, pa rum pa pum pum.
[Busta:]
Matter of fact, let's gather round the fireplace; it's about to get hot in here.
[Justin:]
That's fit to give our king...
[Busta:]
Bieber what up!
[Justin:]
Pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum.

[Busta:]
Lemme get straight to it. Yo.
At the table with the family, havin' dinner,
Blackberry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker.
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer;
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter.
Then I hit him back despite I had some food up on my finger,
Sippin' eggnog with a little sprinkle of vanilla,
Even though it's kinda cold, pullin' out a chinchilla,
Bieber hit me back and said, "Let's make it hot up in the winter."
I said, "Cool." Ya know Imma deliver;
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger.
Before we work I gotta get this off,
See the other family members and drop gifts off.
Then I'm headed to the studio cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now.
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers,
"Merry Christmas, Kwanza, happy Hanukkah! "

[Justin:]
Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum.
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum.
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum.
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum.

If you wanna give, it's the time of year.
JB on the beat, yeah yeah, I'm on the snare.
It's crazy how some people say, say they don't care,
When there's people on the street with no food; it's not fair.
It's about time for you to act merrily;
It's about time for you to give to charity.
Rarely do people even wanna help at all,
'Cause they warm by the fire, getting toys and their dolls.
Not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold,
Wishin' wishin' that they had somebody they could hold.
So I think some of you need to act bold;
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe.

Globe globe globe globe globe.

Whoa, ooh
Well, let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken, and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

Did you know that I loved you or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face
And I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well, I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well, I don't wanna lose it either
I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand

Well, did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
Cause I know that a piece of you's gone
Every time he done wrong I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song that I figure out

Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall

But if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your...
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall,

So fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let yourself,
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall

If you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your... let yourself fall ---Lyrics submitted by Dylan Morici.

Its your chance take her hand to the floor (to the floor)
And if you see something you like then let her know
But you only got one chance it your first dance

When I close my eyes I see me and you at the prom,
We've been both been waiting so long for this day
To come now that it's here lets make it special
There's so many thoughts in my mind the DJ's playing
My favorite song ain't no chaperone's this could be
The night of a dream.

If you give, give the first dance to me girl I promise
I'll be gentle but we gotta do it slowly if you give,
Give your first dance to me we'll cherish every moment,
It only happens once, once in a life time.

I couldn't ask for more we're rockin' back and forth
Under the disco ball we're the only ones on the floor
[we're here tonight], So many thoughts in my mind the DJ's playing
My favorite song how we're all alone, here's to opportunity
Only if you give,

Give the first dance to me girl I promise i'll be gentle
But we gotta do it slowly if you give, give the first dance
To me we'll cherish every moment, it only happens once, once
In a life time.

Everybody says that we look cute together lets make this a night
The two us remember, no teachers around to see us dancin' close
I'm tellin' you our parents will never know before the lights
Up and the music turns off now's the perfect time for me to taste
Your lipgloss, your glass slippers in my hand right here, we'll
Make it before the clock strikes nine.

If you give, give the first dance to me girl I promise
I'll be gentle but we gotta do it slowly if you give,
Give the first dance to me we'll cherish every moment,
It only happens once, once in a life time

If you give, give the first dance to me im gon cherish
Every moment cause it only happens once, once in a life
Time.---Lyrics submitted by Haley.

Subjected to my system, reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interests, our trust was in a bank
That's where our hearts were safe
And then we got closer
Separated from my ex 'til we got closure
Ooh, on every visit, feelings got stronger
Now this is out of our hands, our love is here to stay

So get used to me checking in all day
Get used to me falling through just to see your face
There ain't a moment I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, oh it
Oh used to me holding you, used to me wowing you, oh get used to it

And now my April shower you, forever and for me
'Til your flowers bloom in June
Make sure that our fireworks be your fourth of July for life
As long as you stand right by my side
Keep growing closer throughout October
Ooh counting down, it's almost Christmas eve
Oh seven days shy of a New Year's eve
Then we'll be celebrating

So get used to me checking in all day
Used to me falling through just to see your face
There ain't a moment I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, oh it
Oh used to be holding you, used to me wowing you, oh get used to it

I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't going nowhere
Oh no
I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't going nowhere
Oh no

Put your faith in me
I'll be all you need, I swear
Yeah yeah
I'm gonna be right here
Yeah

So get used to me checking in all day
Used to me falling through just to see your face
There ain't the moment I won't need your grace
Get used to me touching you, get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, hey
Oh get used to it, oh it
Oh used to be holding you, used to me wowing you, oh get used to it

You better get used to it
You better get used to it
Get used to it
You better get used to it
You better get used to it
Get used to it---

Girl you don’t know how I feel
Since you been away oh baby
Any chance that you could take my call?
If you got you today
You say that you don’t wanna talk but it’s cool
Been thinkin’ about you all day long, hopin you’ll pick up your phone
And I know that I don’t wanna lose your love oh baby, oh baby
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
Cuz I really wanna be alone
Baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low

Don’t tell me you’re my heartbreaker
Cuz girl my heart’s breaking
Don’t tell me you’re my heartbreaker
Cuz girl my heart’s breaking (heartbreaker)

Hey girl
Girl you see me standing here, standing in the rain oh baby
Any chance that you could stay right here?
And never go away?
You say that you don’t wanna talk but it’s cool
Been thinkin’ about you all day long, hopin you’ll pick up your phone
And I know that I don’t wanna lose your love oh baby, oh baby
Oh girl I got a secret place that we can go
Cuz I really wanna be alone
Baby nobody else gotta know
Just meet me later on the low

Don’t tell me you’re my heartbreaker
Cuz girl my heart’s breaking
Don’t tell me you’re my heartbreaker
Cuz girl my heart’s breaking (heart is breaking)

So what I’m really tryin to say is, and what I hope you understand
Is despite all the imperfections of who I am I still wanna be your man
I know it hasn’t been easy for us to talk with everyone being around,
But this is.. this is personal, this is for me and you
And I want you to know that I still love you
And I know the seasons may change,
But sometimes love goes from sunshine to rain
But I’m under this umbrella and I’m calling your name
And you know I don’t wanna lose that
I still believe in us
I still believe in love
I still believe in us
I hope you believe in us
The way I believe in us
You don’t see, cuz what you don’t see, is when we don't speak, I really don’t sleep, I wanna talk to ya
And if I had the world in my hands I’d give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feelin’ the way that I’m feelin’
I wanna know if you feelin’.. the way that I, the way that i
You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart
You told me to be careful with your heart, your heart
Be careful with your heart---Lyrics submitted by Azaria Stewart.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Walkin' on the beach, with my backpack on
And my snapback on, with the rap back on, uh-uh
Lookin' for a girl wearing high heels
That's how I feel, I feel, I, uh-uh

That’s when you walk by
Like damn you fly,
And I was like uhuh
Ask me where I’m from
And I say C-C-Canada, uhuh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Uhuh, uhuh, yeah
Uhuh, uhuh, oh yeah

Every birthday, every birthday

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go
(Lips won’t let me go, lips won’t let me go, oh)

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go
(Lips won’t let me go, lips won’t let me go, oh)

Don’t let this go to your head
But you’re the best, I’ve ever had
Not to mention
That thing is swollen
You got me oh so in the trance

Something like a zip lock, but a lip lock
Want you wrapped around me like a wrist watch
Oh, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go
(Lips won’t let me go, lips won’t let me go, oh)

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go
(Lips won’t let me go, lips won’t let me go, oh)

Got me tossing, turning into bed
The places where I rather be instead
You don’t know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Oh, when you got me in a grid lock
What a great spot
Yeah, that turned up kind of love and it just won’t stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh babe

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go
(Lips won’t let me go, lips won’t let me go, oh)

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go
(Lips won’t let me go, lips won’t let me go, oh)

Holding back the faces I would make
I’m a fan and you’re the rock star
Making it hard on me
Visualize a monster
‘Cause you’re too bad for me
Shot that arrow, I’m hit
Need you right near me
Trying to maintain, so don’t mind if I turn away (no, no)
I try to maintain, so don’t mind if I turn away

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go
(Lips won’t let me go, lips won’t let me go, oh)

They hold on tight
Yeah, they hold on tight
Ooh, they hold on tight
Them lips won’t let me go---

Looking out the window
Waiting for your headlights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really coming down tonight

You're scared that I won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm

I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

Pacing down the hallway
Trying to fight the urge to call
I could almost hear a pindrop
Cept for the clock on the wall

And I'm scared that you won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm

I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

I'm praying that you make it home tonight
So we can lay down by the fireside
You and I
Till Christmas morning
There's nothing else that I want this year
More than just to have you here
I'll be waiting

Waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home
Home this Christmas

Looking out the window
Waiting for your head lights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really coming down tonight---

My life is a movie and everyone's watching
So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense

Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

This life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But that's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you

I got to learn things, learn them the hard way
Gotta see what it feels like, no matter what they say

Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

This life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But that's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you

This life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
But that's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you

I'll show you---

I know it's hard, but you know you gotta live
Let"s Go

There's something different in your eyes baby
You can't seem to look in mine lately 
Tell me what is on your mind baby
Or I'm gonna assume that somethings wrong 

(Chorus)
I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not really tripping
I just can't do this again
Please don't tell me your just like them
Please don't tell me your just like them 
Your'e just like them

I know that it's hard to trust of
But you need to trust that my love
Whether I need you in the dust (Yeah)

(Chorus)

Baby you ain't keeping this love on track
Will you runaway baby and then we don't have to look back
You know that i love you girl
So tell me what you're waiting for
You gotta know know know
know know know know know
know know know know 
know know know know

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Tia B..

(Yeah, j-j-j-j-b, yeah, whoa oh, whoa noo.)

Now I can see it girl,
You aint gotta say nothing,
Your lips are calling me,
Like they wanna do something,
I feel the chemistry,
Yeah you're into me,
A little kiss is a definite possibility,

Seen you a couple times,
Had a couple conversations,
Since you've been on my mind,
Had a couple observations,
Like you're a fly chick,
You could be my chick,
Play by the rules and you can get what I give.

Just keep it quiet; keep it on the hush,
And what we do keep it just between us,
I don't wanna see you tweet about J.B. cause,
The only people that should know is you and me so,
Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me,
But I can't have you telling everybody,
You got me all twisted with your lips like this,
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss, kiss) and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss, kiss) and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me,
Then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl,
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

It's confidential, no one has to do with it.
But you and me girl,
Telling would ruin it
Don't need that TMZ,
All in our privacy,
Use them lips for kissing girl,
If you wanna ride with me.
And if you wanna tell somebody,
Then we can call the whole thing off; no problem.
You can go your way, and I'll go mine.
But I'd rather spend a little time with you, yeah

Just keep it quiet; keep it on the hush,
And what we do keep it just between us,
I don't wanna see you tweet about J.B. cause,
The only people that should know is you and me so,
Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me,
But I can't have you telling everybody,
You got me all twisted with your lips like this,
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss, kiss) and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss, kiss) and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me,
Then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl,
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Tell, said are you gonna kiss and tell?
Kiss and tell, oh.

Don't tell your homies,
Don't tell your mama,
Don't tell your girlfriends,
That'll start some drama,
Stay off that Facebook,
I'll treat you real good,
You keep this private,
And you can get what I give.

Baby I know that you're cool with rocking with me,
But I can't have you telling everybody,
You got me all twisted with your lips like this,
So tell me, tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss, kiss) and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss (kiss, kiss) and tell?
Tell me are you gonna kiss me,
Then tell everybody?
Now she got me twisted with your lips girl,
Are you gonna kiss and tell?

Kiss and tell, whoa oh,
I'm not about that,
If your gonna kiss and tell,
Oh no no no,
If your gonna kiss and tell,
If your gonna kiss and tell,
That's not me.---

Ended up on a crossroad
Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't never over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living, ou ou ou ou
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent an angel to help us out, yeah
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
No, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living, ou ou ou ou
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again, oh whoa oh
Life is worth living again

What I'd give for my reflection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see
They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

Life is worth living, oh yeah
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again---

Hey where the party at? Let's go

Bad bitches in the party, alcohol on me
Tell the waitress put the sparklers on my 20 B-T
I asked her what's her name - got the note she said Hammer
On the way to the mattress, said she loved the Panamera
In the trap with J-B with my phone chirpin' like beepers
Mona Lisa, Anna Mae is in the pot when I beat it
Take her across the country, I got plugs on the Visa
Cut your man off little mama, you don't need him

He ain’t never seen a nigga like me
Hoppin' out the Chevy, stepping with the minks, gold chain, Mr. T
In the summer, in the beach, with the hummer, with the leather seat
Would tell you 'bout my mansion but I think they watching me
I'm a vegetarian, all I want is some lettuce and some broccoli
Mansion out in Beverly, your bitch call me your majesty

My bitch is so gorgeous, I might pay her mortgage
I run to the money like Forrest
My life is historic
Travel 'round the world like I'm in orbit
I take your bitch and dunk her like Ben Gordon
I watch her like a telescope
I beat it and kill it like I'm Lil TerRio
I got your bitch, she watching me like Tyler Perry shows
I'm young and always riding in a Phantom Ghost
I paint a picture for niggas like Michelangelo

Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love
And I might be the guy
That’ll make you wanna fall in love with me
Girl, what's your name, happy that you came
I'm the man in this, stick with me, and gain love
Went everywhere around the world
Don’t you know girl I'll be looking for you

Is it her looking for you, looking for you?
I'm not Paparazzi or a stalker
(I’ll be looking for you)
Looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop
(I’ll be looking for you)---Lyrics submitted by Ariana Bieber.

My friends say I’m a fool to think
That you’re the one for me
I guess I’m just a sucker for love

‘Cuz honestly the truth is that
You know I’m never leavin’
‘Cuz you’re my angel sent from above

Baby you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong
Just stay right here
I promise my dear I’ll put nothin above ya. above ya

Love me, Love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, Fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, Kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you (love me)

Love me, Love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, Fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, Kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me

People try to tell me
But I still refuse to listen
Cuz they don’t get to spend time with you

A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh your love

Baby you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong
Just stay right here
I promise my dear I’ll put nothin above ya. above ya

My heart is blind but I don’t care
‘Cuz when I’m with you everything has disappeared

And every time I hold you near
I never wanna let you go, oh

Say that you love me
Fool me, Fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me , kiss me

Tell me what I wanna hear

Fool me, Fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me , kiss me
Say that u miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love me---Lyrics submitted by Kenna.

Love me like you do

When you love me like you do?
Like you do
Hold me tight and don't let go

Baby, baby, baby
Teach me, teach me, teach me
Show me, show me, show me
The way to your heart

Oh, my baby, baby
I'm begging, lady, lady
Put me in the middle
That's right where I'ma start

I like how your eyes complementing your hair
The way that them jeans fit is making me stare
Promise, I'll be here forever, I swear
(Our bodies touching while you)

Love me like you do
Love me like you do
Like you do
Hold me tight and don't let go

When you love me like you do?
Like you do
Hold me tight and don't let go

Baby, baby, baby
Let me, let me, let me
Let me, love me, love me
Be all you desire

Pretty baby, baby
I'm begging lady, lady
Take me to the top now
And I'll take you higher

I like how your eyes complementing your hair
The way that them jeans fit is making me stare
Promise, I'll be here forever, I swear
(Kissing on your neck while you)

Love me like you do
Love me like you do
Like you do
Hold me tight and don't let go

What am I to do
When you love me like you do?
Like you do
Hold me tight and don't let go

Alright, ok
Right there, that way
'Cause when you love me, I can feel it
When your heart beats, I can hear it

Be glad, don't say a word
Don't say no, girl, I'm all yours
Love me like you do but let me go first
Listen to these words right here

Love me like you do, love me like it's new
Love me like you love me, like there's nothing left to lose
We'll hop up in the benz , if you're tryna cruise
Hop up in them bed, baby, if you're tryna snooze
Louis V. shoes, look at me, do it
Got a lot of secrets, baby, can you guess clues?
And if you had a choice I know what you'd choose
(You'd choose me, right?)

Love me like you do
Love me like you do

Love me tight and don't let go

Love me tight and don't let go

For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying, oh my oh, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you've made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
Had never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself---

She says she met me on a tour
She keeps knocking on my door,
she won't leave me, leave me alone
This girl she wouldn't stop, almost had to call the cops
She was scheming, ooh, she was wrong

Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
She was dying for my affection
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her

I'm talking to you, maria
Why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
But she talking in, and she needs to quit it
But never this, all I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
'Cause she's wildin out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

Now she's in the magazines, on tv, making a scene
Oh she's crazy, crazy in love
And she's all over the news, saying everything but the truth
She's faking, faking it all

Cause she wanted all my attention
And she was dragging my name through the dirt
She was dying for my affection
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her

I'm talking to you, maria
Why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
But she talking in, and she needs to quit it
But never this, all I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
'Cause she's wildin out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

Why are you trying, trying to lie girl
When ain't I never met you at all
Saying goodbye, but how could ya
You throw this, you throw this
Your foolness, seduces

Maria why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

But she talking in, and she needs to quit it
But never this, all I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
'Cause she's wildin out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now that girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

That ain't my baby, that ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl
She ain't my baby, she's not my girl ---

Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my words

So you heard it all before
Falling in and out of trust
Trying to rekindle us
Only to lose yourself
But I won't let me lose you
And I won't let us just fade away
After all that we've been through
I'ma show you more than I ever could say

Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my words---

(feat. Big Sean)

I love you, need you
Need you to stay

Girl you're on my mind like 24/7
Every single time that I'm not with you
If you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"Love, you, need you, need you here to stay"

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

Every time you're distant, girl somethin' is missin'
And wish that I could fix it, I wish things were different
What else, what else, if you love me, girl then say it
Say what else, what else, if you wanna be my baby

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"Love, you, need you, need you here to stay"

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

[Sean]
Is this what you want? The baddest, the baddest
I know what you want, without askin'
I hit once, have to have it, hit it twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted
Give you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my "grant it" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed Imma need a fuckin' ransom
Man I got her screamin' "Finally Famous!" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down
I put the writin' on the wall, but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown
We one and one, both one of ones, and when you put the twos together
That's not twenty-two, it's forever, I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer
I swear, Sean Don

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay ---

It’s the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoe

I don’t wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can’t stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I’mma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chilling with my folks, I know
But I’mma be under the mistletoe

Word on the street Santa's coming tonight,
Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But I’mma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoe

Aye, love, the wise men followed the star
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle

Aye, love, don't you buy me nothing
'cause I am feeling one thing, your lips on my lips
That’s a merry, merry Christmas

It’s the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I’mma be under the mistletoe

I don’t wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can’t stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I’mma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty with you

Never say never (never never never)
Pick it up, pick, pick, pick it up
Pick it up, pick, pick, pick it up
Pick it up, pick, pick, pick it up
Pick it up, pick, pick, pick it up

You see I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take a burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return

And there's just no turnin back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will never say never (I will fight)
I will fight til forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up...)
And never say never (ne-never say never x3)

I never thought that I could feel this power
I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea

Cuz there's just no turnin back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
Cuz this is my destiny

I will never say never (I will fight)
I will fight till forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up...)
And never say never

Here we go
Guess who
J Smith and JB
uh huh
I got you lil' bro
I can handle him
Hold up, I, I can handle him
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me, and stronger than me
And his arms are little bit longer than me
But it ain't on a JB song with me
I be tryna chill
They be tryna side with the thrill
No pun intended was raised by the power of will
Like Luke with the force if push comes to shove
Like Kobe with the fourth, ice water with blood (Let's go!)
I gotta be the best
And yes we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath
I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars
So the moon's where I land

Yeah
I will never say never (I will fight)
I will fight till forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up...)
And never say never

Never say never

I will never say never (never say never)
I will fight till forever (make it right)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up, pick it up (up up up...)
And never say never (ne-never say never, never say it x3)

You don't gotta answer none of my calls
I'm believing you'll pick up one day
I don't wanna add to your pain at all
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me? Don't nobody deserve myself
Oh no, baby what I'm saying is

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Calm down, don't rush, no pressure

Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought I'd take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin' it, I'm so delirious
And I'ma put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll be waiting for you
Don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll still
Don't rush, no pressure

Put my key in the ignition
Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me
I know that you ain't got no place to leave
Girl I need your attention
And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it to me, no

I know you don't wanna talk, right
We've been on and off like the crosslights
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?
When I touch you, I get frostbite
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
Hectic, drive you loco
You supposed to me my uno, Yoko
Oh no, round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Think about it

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll be waiting for you
Don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll still
Don't rush, no pressure

You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I know I did you wrong
Let your heart heal
Don't rush, no pressure---

Yeah, yeah
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you

(Alright)
The sun don't set the same as you're watching it go down with me
And I won't sleep the same unless you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart’s a vacant house when you’re gone away, it’s so empty
And love don’t make no sense when it’s empty (Oh no)
I’ve driven almost every car
It ain’t the same when I'm without you, boo
Been around a million stars
None of ‘em shine brighter than you
The sky be so dark now without you
Yeah, ooh, baby

It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
Oh been around the world ain’t the same without you
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you

Focus ain’t the same if the picture ain’t got you in it
And every limelight
Emotions ain’t the same if it ain’t about you, I don’t get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, oh
A million years don’t ...
Don’t nobody go higher than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, woah

It don’t make sense, no
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
Cause I’m doing it with you baby
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
I only want to hear your voice, yeah
Oh, been around the world, ain’t the same without you
Had to find out the hard way
It don’t make sense, no
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
(Going way up, way up)
It don’t make no sense unless I’m doing it with you
(Way up, way up, way up)
(Yeah, slow down stay up, stay up, stay up)
It don’t make no sense unless I’m doing it with you

Time and time again I break a plan
Without you girl I ain’t the man
Could never be all I could be
You overstand, I’m incomplete
Apparently, you gotta know I hate that
How am I supposed to take that?
Boo’d up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that
Couple times you would made it back, be patient
Won’t you pull up to me now, I’m forever young
It’s amazing
I don’t want to sleep unless you at home

It don’t make sense, no
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
No, It don’t make sense
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
No, it don’t make sense, it don’t make sense
It don't make no sense unless I'm doing it with you
(Alright, yeah, alright)---

Lately I've been thinking
Thinking about what we had
I know it's hard
It was all that we knew
Yeah

Have you been drinking to take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you deserve
'Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do

You know there's no one I can relate to
I know we won't find a love that's so true

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together through the storm
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together

I gave you everything, babe
Everything I had to give
Girl, why would you push me away?
Yeah

Lost in confusion
Like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day
But that is the past now
We didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be

Tell me was it worth it?
We were so perfect
Baby, I just want you to see

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together through the storm
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together 

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together through the storm
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together---Lyrics submitted by Slendah man.

To take the pain away ?
I wish that I could give you
What you , deserve 
'Cause nothing could ever,
Ever replace you
Nothing can make me 
Feel like you do 
You know theres no one,
I can relate to 
And know we won't find a love thats so true.

There's nothing like us ,

There's gonna be one less lonely girl

How many I told ya's
Lets start overs

Have you cried on before

How many promises
Be honest, girl
How many tears you let
hit the floor

How many bags you packed
Just to take 'em back
Tell me that
How many either or's
But no more
If you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

Oh no
Saw so many pretty faces
Before I saw you, you
Now all I see is you

Oh no

Cause when you're mine
In the world

One less lonely girl

I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside your world

Christmas was a merry fourteenth
of February
Not one of them spent with you

How many dinner dates 
Set dinner plates
And he didn't even touch his food

How many torn photographs 
Are you tapin' back
Tell me that
Did you see an open door (idk if thats right)
But no more
If you let me inside of your world

Oh no
Saw so many pretty faces
Before I see you, you
Now all I see is you

Oh no
Don't need these other pretty faces
Cause when you're mine
In the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I can fix up your broken heart
I can give you a brand new start
I can make you believe
I just wanna set one girl free
to fall
Cause she's free to fall
With me and my heart'd like to know 
When i got the key to take you and lead the world with one less lonely
Yeah

There's gonna be one less lonely girl

So girl
You just be honest with me, I know we can make this work
I love you

I know that you afraid, babe
But you don't need to be saved, babe
You just need someone who understands
And I think I need the same, babe
Show me where you at, let's keep it honest
Home is where you at and that's a promise
Open up and never keep it from us
Nothing left between us, baby, nothing
Tell me what you want, let's keep it gangsta
Tell me who created you, I'd thank her
Open up and never keep it from us
Nothing left between us, baby

Hopefully you'll give me a chance
All I want is love and romance
I wanna give it all, give it all to you

I wanna dream what you dream
Go where you're going
I only have one life
And I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep
Connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life
I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you

Tell me what you want, I can't believe it
I know that if we make it there's a reason
Sometimes the sun shines, baby
Sometimes it ain't breezy
I hope that maybe this time it may be different
I told you I'mma make it happen, [?]
Yeah, you took your shot and didn't miss it
Ain't nothing more attractive than a mission

Hopefully you'll give me a chance
All I want is love and romance
I wanna give it all, give it all to you

I wanna dream what you dream
Go where you're going
I only have one life
And I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep
Connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life
I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you

If I came to your crib would you open the door?
I don't wanna go down that road no more
Said you wanted it bad, but girl I wanted it more
You're the only one I wanna be with, yeah

I wanna dream what you dream
Go where you're going
I only have one life
And I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep
Connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life
I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you ---

I won’t let the night stand in my way 
I know what I want, I know what I can 
I’m only here to find you, you 
All I need is you by my side 
All I wanna do is lay down next you 

Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one heart
Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one heart 
Baby give it to me 
Cause I don’t want-want nobody when I got-got your body 
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need 
Cause I don’t want-want nobody when I got-got your body 
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need tonight 


See i’ve made mistakes time after time, time, time 
But no not today, won’t leave till I find what I’m looking for 
I’m only here to find you, you 
All I need is you by my side 
All I wanna do is dance under the moon 

Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one heart 
Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one heart 
Baby give it to me 
Cause I don’t want-want nobody when I got-got your body 
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need 
Cause I don’t want-want nobody when I got-got your body 
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need tonight 

Your love is like a rollercoaster 
The way that you take my breath away 
It feels like i’m slowly falling deeper and deeper, deeper and deeper 

Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one heart 
Cause I all I need is one love, one love, one heart 
Baby give it to me 
Cause I don’t want-want nobody when I got-got your body 
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need 
Cause I don’t want-want nobody when I got-got your body 
Baby no no nobody, can give it to me 
Cause I don’t want-want nobody when I got-got your body 
Baby no no nobody, has got what I need

It feels like we’ve been out at sea
So back and forth that’s how its seems
Whoa and when I want to talk
You say to me
That if its meant to be, it will be
So crazy in this thing we call love
The love that we got that we just cant give up
I’m reaching out for you tell me
Out here in the water and I)

I’m overboard and I need your love
Pull me up
I cant swim on my own
Its to much
Feels like I’m drowning without your love
So throw yourself out to me
My life saver
Life saver
Oh life saver
My life saver
Life saver
Oh life saver oh wow

Never understand you when you say
Wanting me to met you half way.
Felt like I was doing my part
Get bringing your coming up short
Funny how these thing change
Cause now I see

So crazy in this love we call love
And now that we got it
We just can’t give up
I’m reaching out for ya

Got me out here in the water and I

I’m overboard

Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept

I put my heart into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach
And you bless me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purpose

Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, forever peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease

I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter when, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach
And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way

Oh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everything

I don't know if this is wrong because someone else is telling me that it's wrong but I feel this so let me just like, try my best not to let this happen again. We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions.

You can't be hard on yourself for these were the cards that you were given so you have to understand that these, like... that's not who you are. You're trying to be the best you can be but that's all you can do. If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself. Give it all you got, but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening.

That's what it's....that's what's happening with me. It's like God I'm giving it all I got, sometimes I'm weak and I'm gonna do it, and it's like I'm not giving myself grace, I'm just like understanding, that's just how it is.---

First, I’ll acknowledge
Our trust has been broken
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night 

Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I’d see your face again
Learnt a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right.

Make it right
Make it right
Make it right
This time I’ll do you right

I’m missing your good intentions
I’m missing you from a distance
Hope you did the same

I know that I caused a problem
Know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away

Learned it don’t pay to lie
Cause I don’t wanna see you cry
Sayin nothin gets you nowhere fast
Imma hold it back inside

But now that I’m back around ya
Nothing else really matters
Hope you feel the same

First, I’ll acknowledge
Our trust has been broken
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night

Blessed me with a second chance
Never thought I’d see your face again
Learnt a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right.

Make it right
Make it right
Make it right
This time I’ll do you right

Im going through all the motions
Trying to find a reason
That we ended that way

Nothing in life is perfect
We’ll be changing like the seasons
That’s what they used to say

If it’s going to sleep alone at night
I don’t wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give
I’m not holdin back this time
Now that I’m back around ya,
Nothin around me matters
Hope you feel the same
First, I’ll acknowledge
Our trust has been broken
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night
Grants me with a second chance
Never thought I’d see your face again
Learnt a lot through trial and error
Tryna make it right.

Make it right (make it right, make it right)
Make it right (make it right, make it right)
Make it right (make it right, make it right)
This time I’ll do you right

You know Imma do you right
You know Imma do you right

You know Imma do you right
Imma do you right
You know Imma do you right---Lyrics submitted by Kara Stapley.

Where did they go?
Nights like this don’t happen anymore
I need to know
Is it me? And did I lose control?

Only overseas
Only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don’t know
What we had before
What it felt before our eyes

Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a world baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

It’s been difficult
I’m just happy there’s no fights no more
But it’s nights like this that I never ever missed you more
If there’s a reason why this happens for

Only memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don’t know

Spinning all around and around for a world baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down

You got stacks like the international house of pancakes
all alone ready to phone me and your hand shakes
palms is wetted (?)
never the walk miles for love I sit at starters deck
it just happens I was floating you seen it cathy
blinked at me then I threw on my thinking cap
taker, and then we can slide to Jamaica
shopping for a year or two stop in Diega
it’s obvious I’m gon sue your mommy is
we just friends so she can’t Clyde Bonnie us
fly walls down in the fly halls
come to the master suite leave every piece in the master hall
all about money tied in a know stand over there
that’s why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, Audi, leather
playing the field tryna outslug Beretta

[Justin Bieber]
You see my baby over hit the road,
Where she’s going i swear nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn’t want him to steal my love

I’m just tryin to be cool, cool, cool (tryn’a be cool)
What would you expect me to do
I’m just tryin to find, find, find
That sweet love of mine

I’m runnin outta time
Where is my runway love
Searching low and high
Know that I’m not givin’ up.

I give it all up for her
I’ll never be enough
I wont stop until I find
My runaway love

[Kanye West]
Last name West and my teeth Diamonds
she said yo wish ya could place your crazy rhyming
listen to Wu Tang
trying crazy suits on (?)
stuntin in our high top louie’s
shorts is the coogies
open up the door when you take her to the movies
when you meet the parents you tell De Niro
her boyfriend is zero she needs to cut the weirdo
next show they gotta up the zeroes
nobody rocking like this 60 years old
the hard johns and the walleys something caught me
I’m telling you what Wu-Tang taught me
the young youth rocking the gold tooth
pull up in a drop top old school bumping the cash rules
no question we the reason why the summers blazin
you looking good fly color Asian
ra I give it yo ya, no trivia
she used to roll with my g-unit like Olivia
till she caught me getting numbers not her’s
guess that’s the day she became a runaway love

[Justin Bieber]
I’m runnin outta time
Where is my runway love
Searching low and high
Know that I’m not givin’ up.

I give it all up for her
I’ll never be enough
I wont stop until I find
My runaway love

Why can’t i find, the love of mine,
When you’re standing in front of my face
Oh, yeah, You must be mine
How did I let you get away

[Raekwon]
Leave it up to the most high sit in a ghost fly
chillin with 2 of my brothers we both live on deck
grabbing em on set
this is how we roll independents she a go I’m gon go get
take that queen assure to ya
we can live every month baby girl just call me up
waking up mess in some cold sweats thinking of this the video tapes
even the stress
my mind is a terrible thing to waste
no love lost I know Im going crazy I can’t floss
me my lady left my homies
it’s all baloney just like rocking an old pony
so when I chillin I’m just lost no more feeling
I need my honey in my life get that film it
take the time Rae Just and Ye shine
my runaway love give me mine come on

He's making a list
He's checking it twice;
He's gonna find out
Who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out!
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

You better watch out!
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
And checking it twice;
He's gonna find out
Who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out!
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

"So it's that time of the year
When you let all your problems go
And you know, you just..."

Shake it, shake it, baby!
Shake it, shake it, baby!
Ooooh...
Shake it, shake it, baby!
Shake it, shake it, baby!
Ooooh...

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out!
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
And checking it twice;
He's gonna find out
Who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town...
Santa Claus is coming to town...
Santa Claus is coming to town...---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.

She don't like the flash, wanna keep us in the dark
She don't like the fame, baby when we're miles apart
And she getting to the point where it's too much for
And she wanna throw us all away, it's too much for
She can't hide away cause the world knows who we are

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

Don't wanna share no one else, want me for herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights

She's giving ultimatums, she don't like this live
She said if I loved her, I'd give it up won't think twice
I can't do that
And it's getting to the point where it's too much for
Wanna throw it all away, cause it's too much for
She don't wanna live this life, damn, it's my life too

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't

Don't wanna share no one else, want me to herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera

She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights

Why can I choose between the two
One of the nights I'll run right now
I wish she could see, how good this can be
I hope she waits a little bit longer
Cause I don't wanna live life, without her by my side
Cause she gets the light that is in me
But she don't know, she don't know

She don't like the lights
She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
She don't, she don't, she don't
She don't like the lights ---

Silent night, holy night! 
All is calm, all is bright 
Round yon virgin, mother and child 
Holy infant so tender and mild, 
Sleep in heavenly peace, 
Sleep in heavenly peace. 

Silent night, holy night! 
Son of god, love's pure light 
Radiant beams from thy holy face, 
With the dawn of redeeming grace, 
Jesus lord at thy birth; 
Jesus lord at thy birth.---

Ohh Ohh

For you I’d write a symphony
I’d tell the violin
It’s time to sink or swim
Watch him play for ya

For you I’d be (Whoa)
Runnin a thousand miles
Just get you where you are
Step to the beat of my heart.

I don’t need a whole lot
But for you I need I
Rather give you the world
Or we can share mine

I know that I won’t be the first one
Given you all this attention
But baby listen

I just need somebody to love
I-I don’t need too much
Just need somebody to love.
(Somebody to love)
I don’t need nothing else
I promise girl, I swear.
I just need somebody to love.

I need somebody I-I need somebody
I need somebody I-I need somebody.

Everyday I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds.
Smile for me (Smile for me)
I would take
Every second, every single time
Spend it like my last dime.
Step to the beat of my heart.

I don’t need a whole lot
But for you I need I
Rather give you the world
Or we can share mine

I know I won’t be the first one
Given you all this attention
But baby listen

I just need somebody to love (Ohh, no no no no)
I-I don’t need too much
Just need somebody to love.
(Somebody to love)
I don’t need nothing else
I promise girl, I swear.

And you can have it all
Anything you want I can bring
Give you the finer things, yeah
But what I really want
I can’t find ’cause, money can’t find me.
Somebody to love. (Ohh Whoa)

Find me somebody to love (Ohh)

I need somebody to love (Yeah)
I-I don’t need too much
Just somebody to love.
Somebody to love.I don’t need nothing else,I promise girl I swear,I just need somebody to love.

Someday at Christmas
men won't be boys.
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys.
One warm December,
our hearts will see
a world where men are free.

Someday at Christmas
there will be no wars.
When we have learned what Christmas is for.
When we have found true light in a world,
there will be peace on earth.

Someday all our dreams will come to be.
Someday in a world where men are free.
Maybe not in time for you and me,
but someday at Christmas time.

Someday at Christmas
we'll see a man.
No hungry children and no empty hands.
One happy morning people will share
a world where people care.

Someday at Christmas
there will be no tears.
All men are equal and no men have fears.
One sunny morning, my heart ran away
from our world today.

Someday all our dreams will come to be.
Someday in a world where men are free.
Maybe not in time for you and me,
but someday at Christmas time.

Someday at Christmas
man will not fail.
Take hope because your love will prevail.
Someday a new world where we can start,
with hope in every heart.

Someday all our dreams will come to be.
Someday in a world where men are free.
Maybe not in time for you and me,
but someday at Christmas time.

Someday at Christmas time.---Lyrics submitted by evanforaker.

You gotta go and get
Angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of Time could someone call the referee
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness

I know you know that I
Made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I Mean
Maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me oh let me
Redeem oh redeem oh my self tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now
I'm sorry yeah
Sorry yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now

I'll take every single piece of the blame
If you want me too
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go I'll go and then
You go you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this

Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now

I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now

I'm sorry (yeah)
Sorry (oh)
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now

Is it too late to say I'm sorry now---

With you,
With you,
I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place

Now Romeo & Juliet,
Bet They could never felt the way we felt,
Bonnie & Clyde,
Never had the highlight,
We do,
We do

You and i both know it cant work,
Its all fun and games,
til someone gets hurt,
And i dont,
I wont let that be you


Now you dont wont to let go 
And i dont wanna let you know, 
There might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we dont wont to fall but, were tripping in our hearts and its reckless and 
clumsy, cuz i know you cant love me
Here



See like Adam & Eve,
Tragedy was a destiny,
like sunny and Cher  
I dont care, i got u baby 
See were both fighting each inch of our fiber 
Cuz ant no way its gonna end right, but we both to foolish to stop


Now you dont wanna let go,
And i dont wanna let you know,
There might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we dont wont to fall but, Were tripping in our hearts and its reckless and clumsy, cuz i know you cant love me  
here


I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
And theres nothing my heart can do (Can Do),
To fight with time and space cause,
Im still stuck in the moment with you

See like just because this cold, cold world is sayin we cant be 
Baby we both have the right to disagree 
it and i aint with it 

And i dont wanna be so old and gray 
reminiscing 'bout the better days 
But conventions tellin us to let go, 
so we'll never know,

I wish we had another time, i wish we had another place 
Cuz everything we did everything we have is stuck in the moment 
(Yeaaah ooh woahhh)
I wish we had another time 
i wish we had another 
place 
ooh noo 

But everything we have is stuck in the moment 
And there's nothing my heart can do (nothing my heart can do)
But to fight with time and space 
'cause im still stuck i the moment with you---Lyrics submitted by Mookie.

Open up to me, it’s all you gotta do

Swap it out with you

Be obliged just to show you how
Follow my lead, that’s what you oughta do

Throw away the keys as long as I’m here with you

Nothing

By separating you from me
These are the terms
That we’re made for each other
Eye for an eye

Wipe your pretty eyes, dry ‘em on my shoulder

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose (Yeah)
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

(Yeah) And so, I'm offering this simple phrase (oh wooah)
To kids from one to ninety-two (Yeah, yeah)
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas (Yeah), Merry Christmas (Oh No)
Merry Christmas to you!---

You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
Sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head, I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least that's what it seems
Could it be I don't know what's good for me?

I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it's hard to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?

Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth

Can't get out of my head, I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

I'm sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I made you feel like
I'm standing on the borderline

Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
Trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
Sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head, I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?---

Girl I've been fooled by your smile
I was mistaken by the way you loved me
We led it straight for a while, yeah
But you deceived me, you convinced me yeah

So clear to me now, can't explain what you're doing to me
I did but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time
But I'll figure it out

Why should we fight the feeling
Let's just live in the moment
Though it's infatuation
I'm good with that

Cause I'm in love with the thought of you
With the thought of you, with the thought of you
I'm in love with the thought of you
All the things you do, with the thought of you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you
Girl, I'm in love with the thought of you, you, you

It's so amazing, girl you're in your own league
Rather be stuck in denial, yeah
Than tryna be without you girl

So clear to me now, can't explain what you're doing to me
I did but I don't know how
It's gon' take some time

Let me tell you a story
About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
And when she's around he feels nothing but joy

But she was already broken
And it made her blind
She can't ever believe that love will treat her right

Did you know that I loved you?
Well you're not aware
Well you're the smile on my face
But that ain't going nowhere

If it'll make you happy
Here see you smile but I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

Who's gonna make you fall
In love
I know you got your wall
Wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all
Of my love
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well I can tell you're afraid of
What this might do
Cuz we got to turn the maze in friendship and that you don't wanna lose

But I don't wanna loose it either
But I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting baby
So take my hand

Well did you know you're an angel
Come from God out of line
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
Cuz I know that a piece of you's gone every time you're done wrong I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song I'll have figured out

What's gonna make you fall
In love
I know you got your wall
Wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all
Of my love
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
Well I will catch you if you fall
And if you spread your wings
You can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

In love
I know you got your wall
Wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all
Of my love
But you can't fly unless you let your
Let yourself fall 
oh baby---Lyrics submitted by Ashley Breeze Crowley.

Oh oh baby
Yeah, oh oh

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

Don't let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Don't want to be left with the questions, why
Let's be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain?

Yeah, sometimes the heart can see what's invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don't ever lie
Well giving up is immature
There's so much more to live for
That I want to see us together now
Cause we're strong enough to endure, woah

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we got to learn to trust right now

Growing pains come along with these changes
Some people get closer some people separate, yeah
Don't think we should separate
And we both adore one another
You're a dream come true
We should start off brand new
That's what we ought to do
Yeah

Yeah, sometimes the heart can see what's invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don't ever lie
Well giving up is immature
There's so much more to live for
That I want to see us together now
Cause we're strong enough to endure, woah

If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now

Trust me right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah-ah-ah-ah
Oh, we gotta learn to trust right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah-ah-ah-ah
Girl you gotta learn to trust me right now
Hey, hey, yeah
If I believe in love and you believe in love
Then we can be in love
If you want the best for us
I got the best for us
We gotta learn to trust
We gotta learn to trust
Yeah, woah woah---

You worked two jobs
To keep a roof up over our heads
You chose life for me
No you never gave up
I admire you for the strength you instilled in me

You were so young
You were just my age when you had me
Mom, you were so brave
There was nothing that would stop or get in our way
And I know you will always be there for me

So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
Cause I still turn to you
I still turn to you
I still turn to you

It was ’94
The year that everything started to change
From before, You had to be a woman
You were forced to change your ways
To change your ways

Then you found the Lord
You gave your life to Him
And you could not ignore
The love he had for you
And I wanted more of your heart

So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
Cause I still turn to you.

I don’t know what I’d do if you left me
So please don’t go away
Everything that you are is who I am
Who I am today.

So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
Cause I still turn to you
I still turn to you
I still turn to you

Cause I, I turn to you ---

You worked two jobs,
To keep a roof above our heads
You chose
A life for me, no you never gave up
I admire you
For the strength you’ve instilled in me
You were so young
You were just my age when you had me
Mom you were so brave.
There was nothing gonna stop or get in our way
And I know you will always be there for me

So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
Cause I, I still turn to you
I still turn to you
I still turn to you

It was ’94
The year that everything started to change from before,
You had to be a woman
You were forced to change your ways, to change your ways
Then you found the Lord
You gave your life to Him
And you could not ignore
The love he had for you
And I wanted more of your heart

So when you’re lost and you’re tired
When you’re broken in two
Let my love take you higher
Cause I, I still turn to you
I still turn to you
I still turn to you

I don’t know what I’d if you left me
So please don’t go away
Everything that you are is who I am

Is a big, big world
It's easy to get lost, baby
You've always been my girl
And I'm not ready to go like this

We make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make the gray clouds turn to blue skies
I know it's hard, baby, believe me

That we can't go nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we got to fear

We are taking to the sky, pass the moon to the galaxy
As long as you're with me, baby
Honestly with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up

It's a big, big world
And I'm gonna show you all of it
I'm gonna leash you with pearls, oh
From every ocean that we're swimming in

We make the sun shine in the moonlight
We can make the gray clouds turn to blue skies
Yeah, I know it's hard, baby, believe me, oh

That we can't go nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we got to fear, whoa

We are taking to the sky, pass the moon to the galaxies
As long as you are with me, baby
Honestly with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up

Nowhere but
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Nowhere but
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa

Baby, we were underground
We are on the surface now
We are gonna make it girl
I promise

If you believe in love
And you believe in us
We can't go nowhere but up
Yeah, yeah

That we can nowhere but up
From here, my dear
Baby, we can go nowhere but up
Tell me what we got to fear

We are taking to the sky, pass the moon to the galaxies
As long as you are with me, baby
Honestly with the strength of our love
We can go nowhere but up

Nowhere but up
Nowhere but up
Whoa, nowhere but up
Oh, whoa, whoa

Yeah, nowhere but up whoa, whoa
Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Holly filler.

Wait just A Minute
Can Wait just A Minute?

Here you are, with me
And if you take my hand babe
We can go to a place, you ain't never seen before

Slow dance in the moonlight
I'm just trying to set the mood right
I'm just doing what a dude do
Do it over and over and over

Quick thing wanna run with me now
Swift thing just come with me now
Good steps go to the beat now
Over and over and over

It's just the way, that way, that way, that do it babe
All I can say, that say, the say that I'm the it
But I'd be lying babe

Just wanna wait for a minute
Wait for a minute

[Tyga]
Hold up, I don't need no love
I said that with a straight face, baby that's poker
Feel a lil sober, got it mixed in my soda
I clean up good, aropa, dopa
Baby I'm the shit but that's a good odor
I'm a young star but my money look Yoda
Crib on the ocean, backyard boat shit
You hating on the internet, I couldn't even notice
Tickets no service, we at the top working
Pop-pops is lurking, told her "don't get nervous"
I don't swerve Suburbans, this a gold derby
Ferarri's and horses, I snap like Torres
No rug, I floor it, girl, come feel important
I'm all about a dollar, babe, banks call me Georgi
9-5 Rollie, 96 Kobe, tonight we gon' ball like Ginobili
You know me, I'm just tryna...

Slow dance in the moonlight
I'm just trying to set the mood right
I'm just doing what a dude do
Do it over and over and over

Quick thing wanna run with me now
Swift thing just come with me now
Good steps go to the beat now
Over and over and over

It's just the way, that way, that way, that do it babe
All I can say, that say, the say that I'm the it
But I'd be lying babe

Just wanna wait for a minute
Wait for a minute ---

Happy birthday

You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth don't make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it
Believing in that she'll say I'll have you livid
No, they won't be happy 'til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it

They ain't never had your back like I got it
They ain't never had trust like how we got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
Don't question it

You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth don't make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

It's like you're always looking for a problem
The raining of equations for you to solve 'em
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'
Get the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em

They ain't never had my back like you got it
They ain't never had a chance how you got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
Don't question it

You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth don't make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

She texts me "How's your love life?" and "How are you? ", I said "I'm good"
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together, warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever, she says whatever
I says whatever, who get you wetter than a half moon wearer
HSTRY sweater, serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did that one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind going when I'm home
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you
You and I in that Wraith, retire my pimp super-fly cape
Just my Mets cap and my badge and I'm straight
Esco

Don't question it
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth don't make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are---

What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
Hey yeah
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Ohh
What do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're so indecisive of what I'm saying
Trying to catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end
Where do I start
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you up then you're down and between
Ohh I really want to know...

What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
Hey yeah
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Ohh
What do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

You're overprotective when I'm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end
First you wanna go to the left then you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up then you're down then between
Ohh I really wanna know...

What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
Hey yeah
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?

I want to know...
Oh
What do you mean?
Ohhh
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
(Oh baby)
Ohh ohh ohh
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
(I'm so confused baby)
Hey yeah
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
(A bit more straightforward)
Ohh
What do you mean?
Said we're running out of time
What do you mean?
Ohh ohh ohh
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?---

I need you (the) I need you
I need you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you
I need you the most

I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can’t deny it
Now I’m all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need you?
Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down I didn't leave you
I was by your side
So where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?

I gave you attention when nobody else was paying
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying?
To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playing, that's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying, oh Lord

Where are you now that I need you?
Where are you now that I need you?

I need you (the) I need you
I need you (the) I need you
I need you, you, you, you, you, you

Ohh, Ohh,
Ohhh woah...

Where are you now?
When I need you the most
Why don't you take my hand?
I wanna be close.

Help me when I am down
Lift me up off the ground,
Teach me right from wrong.
Help me to stay strong.

So, take my hand and walk with me.
Show me what to be,
I need you to set me free Yeah

Where are you now...
Where are you now? 
Now that I'm half grown
Why are we far apart? 
I feel so alone.

Where are you now?
When nothing's going right
Where are you now?
I can't see the light.

So, take my hand and walk with me.
Show me what to be,
I need you to set me free Yeah, Yeah

I need you, to need me
Can't you see me
How could you leave me?
My heart is half empty
I'm not a whole when your not with me.

I want you here with me,
To guide me,
To hold me, and love me now

Where are you now...

So, take my hand and walk with me.
