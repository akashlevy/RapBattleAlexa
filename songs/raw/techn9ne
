[Intro:]
wake up in the mornin' with my better half
on a boat lift the covers, then i pet her ass
never know when i gotta go, cause my life is impossible
the way i live it, the good things never last
so i live for the minute, just wanna start ta begin it
when i wake up again I'm on stage rockin'
twenty thousand people they yellin' feedin' at my ego
when it's over the groupies they wanna know what's poppin'

[Verse 1:]
Double O N9na
known for dippin'
from place to place
i gotta decate the mission
gotta get the money, but what do you know
i wake up in a movie theater with my little ones on a big one
hollywood movie with the jackass cats
i close my eyes
i open' em and I'm back at rap
in the studio collabin' killin' whack ass crap
but then in a blink i wake up, and i pack that strap
in the club, cause some other niggas want my head
i don't know to much about' em, but they want my red
i ain't trippin' don't wanna let the killers in blue start me
wake up again, I'm at dj clue party
with diddy and jim jones
jewell and rick ross
cafe trey songs, and drake this is boss
amazin' life's hella crazy livin' like I'm a quatro triple double agent

[Chorus:]
Double O N9na
where I'm about ta go i don't even know
Double O N9na
in a place where almost anything goes
Double O N9na
many roads when I travel this what i chose
Double O N9na
the way I'm livin' I really got to many roads

[Verse 2:]
me i alotta women, but didn't need me
wake up trying ta hide it, but sin seize me
over seas nigga tryin' ta begin freaky
wake up at the awards of MTV-u
then i stash up a tour, wake up in back of ma zou
i get ta mackin' a few
after the yack i take' em to the sack, and i screw
scat then back to the lab i got some rappin' ta do
then i wake up again I'm on stage at pay due
this characteristic is made to slay crews
some try to get at me to battle, but they lose
then I'm waking up with my kids on a paid cruise
they callin' me daddy
wake up at the strip club they callin' me daddy
man I'm goin' hella baddy
amazin' life's hella crazy livin' like I'm a quatro triple double agent

[Chorus:]
Double O N9na
where I'm about ta go i don't even know
Double O N9na
in a place where almost anything goes
Double O N9na
many roads when I travel this what i chose
Double O N9na
the way I'm livin' I really got to many roads

[Verse 3:]
at any rate I'm all over the place
music ain't big enough father, and the mode that i made
got me feelin' moon stricken, but need remain calm
livin' like I'm out of a scene from James Bond
switch it, change it, feel it, strange it
livin' multiple lives, rappin', and gang bangin'
freakin' all over the world, middle west swangin'
always on the move ain't never time for hangin'
slip with my shit, my grip don't fold
pick the fly chicks, and ditch those hoes
kiss from my bitch, my kids get dough
rippin' my scripts, i hits this road
Double O N9na nigga, i loves this grind
doin' alotta good, and mud this time
dippin' all over the planet tellin' the bitches the name is N9ne...
Tech N9ne

[Chorus:]
Double O N9na
where I'm about ta go i don't even know
Double O N9na
in a place where almost anything goes
Double O N9na
many roads when I travel this what i chose
Double O N9na
the way I'm livin' I really got to many roads---Lyrics submitted by gus.

I find a certain comfort in searchin' through the
Darkness on my quest to find the light
And as I'm digging through the ruins, that line these city streets
A sense of hope walks with me

Still I hold onto this dream of ... and I spite this mind
No longer shall I try to find a name with ... nor provide
Shelter for my

Demons, there's so many I smell brimstone
Come in through family, I'm seein' all of the sin shown
Kin grown into enemies that'll be your friends gone
Ain't you very lonely, but a sanctuary when grim's home
Got rules but I dig it, God knows that I'm wicked
Or does it, cause when I tug it, it never shows that I visit
Tell the judge, y'all make me feel like it's hella love
So stand out amazed when I let loose on my ...
My spirit needs jumper cables, never know love but I want ya label
I'm comfort-able
Nothing lately makes me feel like they worthy of trustin'
So I load my gun with the intentions of bustin'

I'm, cool with the trauma now
Cause it's abundant, ever since I laid my mama down
Some members talked me so bad, 'til my persona found
No mercy, go Earthly, cock and make the llama sound
Cause that's the language they know, deepened anguish they grow
To people without rules, and make you doubt who's
Gonna love you forever cause they gave you some hateful mouth ooze
I was so effin true, but I became the person to shout to
Now that I'm lonely, I don't get no fun like Laos food
And I'm such a meanie, wanna come and see me? Reroute dudes
I'm chillin' in hell in hot water sittin' on my couch fools
So it ain't no problem walkin' through yo hell in ya house shoes

I'm good where I am in the dark, and darkness alone
I'm comfortable with it
Bring it, if you got it to bring---

[1st Verse]
Ain't no way you bout to stop this sickness from the
Deepest darkest part of misery psycho alpha schizo
Get your chick she digging me 

A.B.S.O.L.U.T.E. P.O.W.E.R.
See me clownin', look at all you player haters
frownin'

Raw, God said kill'em all Tech's backs to the wall
Fighting 4 my life and Imma bust back till they fall
And I ain't even slangin' them thangs I'm hollin' 187
If you trippin' with strange

I'm really real with it,

like my homey A.J. say deal with it
Pushin' and pullin', fightin' 4 the mill ticket,

in a minute imma do it like a villain 

Imma get'em in the middle of a Bomb,

put'em on the spot till the funk go pop and

I bet he never have another quam.

Tech nizzle, when I'm thizzled it's who B you
rollin' with
Dave, Trav, Violet Brown and 3DQ

Hootie Hoo 

for those who not knowing that Mizzou thee true,

Imma tell ya like the swedish would say it; 

sug min kuk

[Chorus]
Absolute power
That's the only way to roll
Absolute power
They love us everywhere we go
Absolute power
Tecca nina's bout to blow
Absolute power
Absolute power
[Repeat 2x]

[2nd Verse]
I do hip hop, and I mix it with the hard rock 
Designing this rhyming 4 climbing

Tech N9ne he's unwinding
The shining it's blinding,

greedy so we constantly grinding

I been in the game 16 years making rap tunes,

raising hella havoc up in the classroom 

now in 02 you can watch me 

clownin' diamonds shining watchin' dvd's on
The Hachitachi
It's all Jesus, now I keep the crowds pumpin' they
Jumpin' get back to the tele we rollin' and stickin'
Somethin' racing to the main line absolute power
Is having Halle Berry and Juliet Lewis at the same

time

Oh that's how strange niggas run, listen to the villain
With the gun associated tongue we're close to the

end but not done

the Tech's just began begun

beginning to begin to have fun

The curse, is tryin' to put me in the hearst

but I will not tumble first things first,

took a lot of shit and I can't take more

Fuck Jay Farries and everybody

Down wit'em and fuck JCOR.

[Chorus]
[Repeat 2x]

[3rd Verse]
Thanks to Strange Music I'm comin' and all my

Enemies they runnin' now all my haters bummin'

cause I was summoned, 

we Kansas City players 

and we bout sold game, 

we make it so that Tech N9ne is a household name

How many points you got? I got 50 here's a

question to the censorship committee 

who's the biggest gangs of niggas in the city,

my villains are Gritty, 

Big Scoob, Txx Will, Bakarii, 

rest in peace Short Nitty

Power the evil way is power the people say
Rebel yellin' with felons and my pockets are swellin'
This beats from Berlin Germany throwin' up Mizzizy
So ain't no other city concerning me

I teach it and I speak it very loosely
Stamina gunnin'

got player haters running profusely
Now I got the parents pissed and 
Ready to noose me, cause they know that
Absolute power corrupts, absolutely

[Intro]
I see you looking at me
Looking at me, so I ask

[Hook]
Am I a psycho? Am I a psycho?
Yeah I’m a psycho, I guess I’m a psycho

[Verse 1: Tech]
You’re crazy, I like you, but you’re crazy, my tours paid me
So I used that dough to allure ladies to manure bathe me
Never that; my minds for sure shady
Pure Hades, Rev X Steady couldn’t endure to save me
Why did I let this stripper burn me on the arm with a cigarette
In the same spot 10 times in a row when i feel that burn I palm the clitoris
I’ma get her wet, sorry to get carried away, I feel stupid cause I ain’t did her yet
Maybe she never let a fine nigga stare at her breasts, and get vexed, so N9NE bit her neck
Open! I try to contain it but that damn dame thang’s soakin’
Alter ego say why you let them gang bang folk in
Strange Lane hopin’ I can maintain coping
But ain’t nobody talkin when the insane mane spoken
I like fire on my skin, blood on my draws
From up on her walls, I’m suffering, I’m stuck in her claws
Stuffed in her jaws, huffin’ and puffin’ hollerin' i'm a dog, afterwards i like really hot scalding water on my balls

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Mom? Dad? I’m no longer the boy you’ve used to seeing
I’ve changed a lot, plus I’ve grown to hate every human being
My mood swings have now turned my dreams into gruesome scenes
Now I’m doing things I don’t normally do
When illusions seem to be the only pleasures I can gain
Heck, if I was sane I’d put down the mic and say fuck it I’ll never rise to fame
But with the wicked records I contain, I could probably jeopardize your name
No lovey-dovey let’s ignite the flame if you’re lucky you survive the pain
Sorry that ain’t very merry to say, why is this game so scary to play?
Well let me think, cause every day my balls are getting too hairy to shave
Pause a minute, I’m stressin’ the game if I go to hell, than heaven’s to blame
I don’t mean to come off crazy but you mothafuckas seem to think that I’m hella deranged
When I was seven years old, I fell on my head and I severed my brain
If you think I’m lying then ask my mama nigga she’ll go tell you the same
Should I be ashamed? No, I’m living my life so ghetto fabulous
Before you get bent outta shape, my nigga let me ask you this

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
I stab you with this mic and rap this verse I’m rappin’ to you
Matter fact I’m rapping through you, never say my motherfucking name
Unless you absolutely have to I am not no fucking jacket
With no matching shoes and you are not no fashion guru
Can’t even see you niggas, y’all wish I was rappin’ to you
Matter of fact act like I’m rappin’ to you if that gives you passion
To use as an excuse to jump out of conclusion
That I’m attackin you dudes is just like old fashion voodoo
Y’all ain’t even the shit, no ya’ll ain’t even the doodoo
I got more flavor on the tissue paper under my two boots
So I’m slapping you fools with wooden paddles you stupid
Baby sitting little bastards like little afternoon children
You can call me psychotic but it’s more like schizophrenic
And I can speak can anyone tell me just where my medicine is
Guess I gotta show these minors just what my avenue is
Man I swear I’m all about my brain like graduate students
I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings
I see your tears, come here, give me your face, let me clear it
But I wonder how it would look if I could peel it back with a skillet
Then I would feel it crack when I hit it, then I’mma split it back when you heal it
Dammit Bobby boy, what in the hell, what in the heaven, what in the Earth
Where is your mom? Why do you curse? Where are you from?
Where was your birth? Where was you first? Why weren’t you in church?
Why is there dirt, all on your shirt? Man I think you’re going berserk..

The same situations that occur throughout your life, 
that gives you an attitude, you know, a really bad attitude, 
because you've been taught by good people how to treat people with respect and you learned right wrong, 
so, when shit is always wrong around you and you a mothafucka just taught to do right, 
you have a certain attitude towards those kind of mothafuckers or towards those things that are wrong and not righteous, 
you start getting a fuckin' attitude that might piss other people off, 
but you don't give a fuck, 
because the things they do are the unjust shit that they do, 
makes you anti as fuck, 
anti everything, anti everything they are 'bout, 
cause they ain't good, anti everything they fuckin' breathe or eat or whatever the fuck, 
you're just against everything that ain't right, 
why I feel like I feel. 
I feel like fuck the mothafuckers, 
I'm anti all that bullshit that they on

(Shit shit shit shit, mic check 1, 2)
Download this on the down low bitch
I'mma amputate your fingers and the clown won't miss, nigga
Fuck everything that ain't righteous
Spotify the reason the music became lifeless
70% of our fraction are from hideous[?] [?] game Crysis
Make a nigga wanna blow up they headquarters and blame ISIS
I'm watching the riot from Michael Brown and I see a crazy nigga yell let's burn this bitch down
Why niggas, you fuck up the O'Reilly's, the BBQ spot and then the beauty supply niggas?
Depreciating, for justice keep waiting, cause you burned up everything except the police station
I'm anti stupid shit for ladies participating come and loot this dick
They been out and murdered Kendrick Johnson
And covered it up, watch my sin[?] get Compton!
You hate me cause tough and freely's the tone
I ain't never shopped on Black Friday, nigga, leave me alone!

I'm still smiling
While I'm crying

Anti as fuck
Anti as fuck
Anti as fuck
Anti as fuck
I'm anti as fuck
Anti as fuck
Anti as fuuuck
Go!

Ahha! Listen!
COINTELPRO we livin' it out
Used to love turkey, devour Thanksgiving about
Jack your land from the Indians and murk 'em on it
Make it bigger, then get the niggers to come and walk upon it
Give 'em drugs and guns and excuses to never be
Better than a CRIP or rep the letter B
Show you you can YouTube it and make fights
Vatican at it again, bangin' for they gay rights
And I'm supposed to follow YOU to the Promiseland?
I ain't got no insurance, leave it in Obama's hand!
At 19 I slapped the shit out a cop!
Now Ferguson had me murderin', burn down a donut shop!
You dumb niggas! Ooh, you'll be the only bum niggas
Get your ass out the street 'fore I shoot me more than one niggas
Bill Cosby? WHAT THE FUCK?
I was ridin' with you, till the 20th bitch got stuck
I guess the Jell O Pudding Pop ...
Mellow we couldn't stop
He would give 'em the Spanish Fly
But fuck it, so would I!---

Domine...
Question for the the maker…and it's…aw yeah?
This the way it's supposed to be huh? Alright

Sippin'
On a glass of red wine
Right before bedtime thinkin'
Everybody down here trippin'
If you up there
Upstairs
This is Nina tellin' you to listen
The vision I'm givin' everyday
Life is dumpin' on us like a pigeon
I get many enemies with this Forbes list
But I get rid of energy from piss poor pricks
Can I get to heaven all I get is threatened
Every time I get more chips
Gotta grip four fifths
For the sick forces I gotta fight
All of the night with cops, Crips
Bloods with sore fists
And them Nazi’s wanna hem Hadji
Up it ain’t too many men godly
Hideous so many cities bust in
Ferguson to Libya, Benghazi
Human equality never been a level playin' field
Man it been wobbly
So many circles of sin rob me
That’s why we go angel to grim Cosby’s!
Yellin' this to my superior
Degrading of love is inferior
Upon this earth a lot of people jerked around about 300,000 to Syria
Are you serious?
I could never think of burying my children p-p-period
Nigeria, I'mma yell while I'm walking through this hell cause I'm furious!
Zuse know what's up, he said you got to pack a toy
But why you gotta let the bodies dropping at a coffee shop in Aussie (Aussie, Oi Oi Oi)
But around here, loving coco's the bomb
Meanwhile so many people are taken out by the hands of Boko Haram
Aw yeah?!
They gotta suffer the penalty cause of our education
Nobody wanna say nothing but I gotta call it abomination
Pissed off thinkin' what this cost
What these babies blood drippin' for?
So I say in Latin, listen Lord!
AUDIRE DOMINE! (AUDIRE DOMINE)
AUDIRE DOMINE! (AUDIRE DOMINE)
Only way people are gonna be able to kill off a demon is
Pick up a gun and be ready to put it between him
My nigga be screamin'
AUDIRE DOMINE! (AUDIRE DOMINE)
No fear the only way
Every day flatten the beast
At least Anonymous is hacking for peace
And yet we gotta bust cause we packing a piece
Choke not another one of us for the snappin' police
Who the hell a brother gonna trust when it's always dishonor
Hate me like Obama
And I ain't even got around to askin' you the question God
What about my, mama!?---

What a shame when a thang blast at ya
Cause you're lame you're a dame slash actor

Tecca Nina bout to hit 'em wit the woop wop
Now the barrel of my governor is hoo tot
Cause you the type that'll get your whole shew crot
Loud mouth nigga trippin' thinking that he Putac
Got a strong hand, I'm a mown grand
Little boy, now you fuckin' with the clong ran
Oh you just showboatin'? It's over now y'all can quit
Cause you can get it for something near as shalkin' tit
Just a crone phall, then it's on y'all
Fuck around and get ya dome sawed off a brone stawl
I can't wait to hear ya squeal and holler
How you set trippin' when you got a multi-dillion mollars, nigga
Stupid, such a sucker--
Nuck figgas always got to make a chother bruncha
Never had no problem takin' down another buster
Cause they be doin' shit bass ackwards Futhermucka

I'm Yo Gotti, the drug dealer
I'm Yo Gotti, the thug nigga
I'm Yo Gotti, my own heir
And if you wanna ODX, then tell Gotti to blow it, nigga
I've been getting money for a long time
You've been throwing up the wrong sign
Pussy ass nigga, you a cross jump
Fuck boy, you a ho nigga
And you remind me of my ho, nigga
None out here than a broke nigga
Got a ..., and an AK, and an FN
Got a white [?], and a white Ghost, and a white Benz
I ain't wantin' with niggas, so you don't get money with niggas
I don't make funny with niggas, I don't get honey with niggas
Just keep it one hunned with niggas
Tripping one thousand with niggas
I rentin' houses with niggas
I put in work with the squad, we even so foul with a nigga
So, fuck

Bass ackwards, anonymous with rappers
All these niggas claiming they maintaining with the factors
When you push a package, would you ever clap shit
All these niggas talking ain't done nothing but this rap shit
Reason why I take this place and had to find some spaces
I killed one of these fucking rap niggas and ate his fucking face
Glaze at this rap game, mistake I ever made
It hit me wind and rewind, deleting everything I layed
More frim a rap nigga, rock nigga, I don't lie for fun
Fuck fame, and fuck you, and fuck him, and her too
Had to call the big dog, I had to breathe smoke
But Yo Gotti and Big Scoob, and this ain't called dope?
Bass Ackwards

These niggas ass backwards
She let me hit that ass backwards
Pussy niggas act hard, get killed for bad acting
Trigger man laugh man
Its funny how this shit go
Redrum was the case that they gave me
I sipped slow and stumbled down a slipped slope
I could hide the chopper in the trench coat
Tunechi go berserk in this bitch
Spellin' stressed backwards, dessert when my shit
I'm reversing this shit
My double R & R, I park on the curb in this bitch
The money, I'm submerged in this shit
So frankly, I'm stalking Ben Franklin
I am Wayne Carter, oops, I meant Cayne Warter
Cocaine on back arter
Flip you ass backwards
Bitch you are bass ackwards if you think that's awkward
Strange Music---

[Intro]
I'm just a young boy, trying to get my money on 
Making music in K.C., he-he-he-he-he
But Mitch Bade nigga's, wanna hate Techa Nina, 
And they won't stop fucking with me, so I’ma fuck wit nigga's

Na-na-na-na-na, you can not fuck with
That nigga Tech N9ne, coming wit that rough shit
Them niggas know that I deserve it when they heard it
Had the nerve to say its nothing, nigga, so I got to bust this

Be Jealous, This is dedicated to all ya'll hater's
Be Jealous, I see ya'll watching me when I walk in the club
Be Jealous, This is dedicated to all Mitch Bader’s
Be Jealous, You mother fucker's ain't showing Tech Nina no love

[Verse 1]
Fuck Muh-Fuckers, buck Muh-Fuckers
And the pain come nigga with a bang, I’ma killer, better duck Muh-Fucker
Watch you standing on? (Nada) What you claim to bone? (Nada)
What you plan to own? (Nada) That shit done came and gone
Blood sweat and tears nigga, been about fifteen years nigga
Ain't never been no fears nigga, All I hear is cheers nigga
That’s why I be in the bathroom with the bitches at Maniacs
That’s why them hoe's in the club with Tech given blowjobs in the back
How many niggas really worry bout scars? How many niggas wanna become a wuss?
Fuck with a nigga like Tech and a buzz Right to the head and the grave is dug
Mean Mugs, nigga's ain't never seen love
So they stream blood while I fiend bub full of green shrubs
And mushrooms, I bust rooms, open a custom
To float across the ocean with verbal motion the notion is boasting
I'm hoaking with jealous, mother fuckers embellish
But you can’t say I ain't ready for fame, yonks, and relish

[Chorus]
Be Jealous, when you see me on the T.V. Screen whiling
Be Jealous, when you see me in the magazine smiling
Be Jealous, when they let me in the club for free, niggas
Be Jealous, cuz I'm bumy wit bitches around me
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (ha-ha)
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (he-he-he-he)
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (ha-ha)
And the lit, I’ma spit, I’ma kick that shit

[Verse 2]
No more stalling, I’ma start prowling on niggas, growling on niggas
And we smiling cuz the Villain album went six thousand on niggas
In Kansas City alone, we packed the dome with Mike and Liddy alone
In the west side, Lee Jone, Milly Mal, I left you but it’s a pity you’re gone
Niggas ain’t know mine, cuz they know it, and I’ma do it big
That’s why the Techa Nina never ever got a problem getting a gig
Cuz I rip shit they liked (chea), I flip shit you make right (chea)
When I spit shit, I get rich quick, and make hits from doctors they liked (chea)
9 millimeter guns, gonna be the one, making a million, when I come
Never gonna be the bum, where I come from, niggas better get some
Tried to be right to these niggas, tried to be nice to these niggas
So now its time for Nine Godzilla to make mice of these niggas
You envy me, cuz your bitch play Techa Nina all day
And you see me on MTV, kicking it with king Tech, my nigga sway
Broke niggas ain’t friends to me, you niggas really want me to disperse?
Alright, I’ll leave, but when I come back it’s gonna be 20 G’s a verse, nigga

[Chorus]
Be Jealous, when you see me on the T.V. Screen whiling
Be Jealous, when you see me in the magazine smiling
Be Jealous, when they let me in the club for free, niggas
Be Jealous, cuz I'm bumy wit bitches around me
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (ha-ha)
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (he-he-he-he)
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (ha-ha)
And the lit, I’ma spit, I’ma kick that shit

[Verse 3]
Niggas better stop talking about me, I ain’t did shit
I don’t rap against niggas, stop trying to get me to rap so ya’ll can make grits
Agony, don’t be speaking my name, I know I fucked up
On a personal tip, but if you niggas talking about you better rap, mother fuckers better duck
And if any of you niggas over there on the inside, infiltrating me and my rouges
Them niggas don’t give no fucks about how many Tech N9ne units sold
And whoever you bitch niggas is saying, I’m kicking it in Lee Joes log
Lee Joe’ll tell you I’m original, and by the way Lee Joe my dog!
And that justice mother fuckers won’t quit, saying The Calm Before The Storm” aint shit
We killed yall when 96-97, when about when the new shit hit
And I heard niggas said I was washed up, said the Tech N9ne flow was sleep
That’s probably why I got new shit in new movies like Digging In Water and Its Too Deep
Niggas be jealous, tie you up and beat you down to a bloody pulp son
Got my villains and me, mad enough to bust one
I’m the second coming, but you don’t know cuz you dumb
Before I go, I’ll tell you jealous mother fuckers to suck one

[Chorus]
Be Jealous, when you see me on the T.V. Screen whiling
Be Jealous, when you see me in the magazine smiling
Be Jealous, when they let me in the club for free, niggas
Be Jealous, cuz I'm bumy wit bitches around me
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (ha-ha)
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (he-he-he-he)
Ha-ha, mother fucker, ha-ha (ha-ha)
And the lit, I’ma spit, I’ma kick that shit---Lyrics submitted by Jamie.

(Insanity at it's finest. Fire starter, riot maker,
moon stricken, animal need, bad seed, untaimable beast)

”Everybody around me always think they know what's
going on inside my mind, they think I'm Mr. Nice Guy all the time.
How they say on Diary? You think you know, but you have no idea.”

[Chorus:]
K.C.M.O is with me
Must make mo (more) dough
We will be shaking your floor
Come against me
That’s a no no
Yo, cause I’m a Beast

I can smell your woman's rosy punani
on the dance floor all the way in VIP
I'm a rapper, I can snatch her,
and she will leave with me because of my stature.
Now, everybody move, everybody bounce.
Whoever the Nina choose, we about to pounce.
(work it out)
With the 151 and a bottle of calm?
helpfully let me hit this model in the grado.?
I like all woman, tall woman, and small woman.
Ya gotta let tech knees tease your shakra.?
Species release freaks, please the monster.
Petite beast, feast, these G’s will rock ya.
Handcuff a busta don’t trust a
Round these hustlers homie don’t be a sucker.
When your lover say tecca Nina's a brother,
she's trying to say that I rushed her then crushed her.

[Chorus x2]

I'm about to get that money like a robbery,
Now I got it all my enemies wanna clobber me.
Squallery harder we need dollars comradely
the hotter the scholar be, the larger the lottery.
Need ten, twins, gotta succeed spend G's, Ben Franks
We cram G’s in bank, breathe said we win thanks
Hungry like the wolf indeed, but I give
money to my crooks in need, I live
In Sherman Oaks but from Kansas City,
I miss home, Cali is Business but man it's pretty.
I ain't lying y'all, Monster for money for mine y'all
if I wasn't getting money, I'd do time dog.
You'd never see the nine fall,
big house, wood floors,
maid cleaning the bitches with pine-sol

[Chorus x2]

Friend, this industry is no kin to me,
behold the flow of the century.
But they scared of me
rappers they don't compare to me.
Fair to be said that he dares to be sincerely a rarity.
Check the sound scan, look around man.
Wake up look at you Jacob, you in killer clown land.
Face paint and jugalettes with bubble butts
And we rock it twisted diddy women in the button ups.
Hands down we rock harder than kiss,
but rap me Kutt and Krizz.
Can I get two stomps and a clap in this bitch
Nina shot to the top 'cause the plots to get rich.
Tell ya executives,
I'm next for this
Success it is.
Yet the best for Tech, this ain't
Baptist Pentecostal or Methodist..
This is the beast baby.
Out, I mean exodus.

(Money and I will destroy you. I am the beast)

(Krizz)
As the sun falls, darkness shall come

(Tech N9ne)
How do I describe my pain/ It just rains n it rains at the same time flame/ I am bane, insane in my veins no restrants can change or contain me. I'm dangrous/ When I gave you my light it was wrong, wasn't right, n no love was inside when I need it/ So I run with the night and the songs that I write'll be violent, it wont be defeated/

Its jet black in my brain cuz the hatred you gave me has turn me to twisted/ You don't like this, suck my dick, all the kids with the siccness been waitin for this shit/

I wanna get into the mind of your youngest/ Fill it with fungus and grow it til its humungous/ Psycho alumnis, the tip of the tongue slip, urgin the punk bitch eat shit from your dumb pig!

(Krizz)
Ev-ery-one are you ready for doom, cuz I've blacked the sun, and I've bloodied the moon/ I bring gloom when I step in the room/ With the fumes of a tomb, I consume all the light in the day/
Ev-ery-one are you ready for doom, cuz I've blacked the sun, and I've bloodied the moon/ I bring gloom when I step in the room/ With the fumes of a tomb, flowers bloom when I'm taken away/

(Tech)
I've got this cloud inside thats consumin my mind, all the brown in my eyes are desolving - Into the whites of my eyes, now the night will arise and I'm hype cuz the beast is evolving/ Step in to my dreams lot of bleeding, and semen and green rotted demons/ And they feed their seeds collic greens, full of feces and cheese pieces of human ceribrum, these evening/

(Stay awake) Cuz everything I touch - turns to mold/
(If you want me) And everything I fuck - straight explodes

Are we there yet? Are you scared yet? You got that pussy in your pants, wanna share dat? Let me in I'mma rip it then I'mma tear that/ I'm tryin to eat it, bitch, where the muthafuckin hair at?!

(Krizz)
Ev-ery-one are you ready for doom, cuz I've blacked the sun, and I've bloodied the moon/ I bring gloom when I step in the room/ With the fumes of a tomb, I consume all the light in the day/
Ev-ery-one are you ready for doom, cuz I've blacked the sun, and I've bloodied the moon/ I bring gloom when I step in the room/ With the fumes of a tomb, flowers bloom when I'm taken away/

(Tech)
Heat swells, teet tells, everybody eat nails, sleep well/ Held the gun, I come, to attack everyone/ You little crumbs, all are done/ I'mma blacken the sun/

Allah banish it, damage it, can you manage to vanish cuz you like Anakin man it, damn it its no panicin/ when I eat your soul, he's north pole, that mean I'll be more cold, freeze more slow, fourty be-low/

Piss, lava, an' quarvo/ Plus hobinero/ Now chug it! Burn the head to their toes, I will not spare those/ I love it!

This is the result of you! Thinkin I'm queer. Callin me weird. Thinkin I'm devil so you niggas don't cheer. I don't give a fuck whut you think of Tecca Ninna this year!

(Krizz)
Ev-ery-one are you ready for doom, cuz I've blacked the sun, and I've bloodied the moon/ I bring gloom when I step in the room/ With the fumes of a tomb, I consume all the light in the day/

Ladies used to hate me, now they comin out they panties

I ain't never seen so much green
Than when I seen when my team hit the scene
It must be a dream. Hit the stage, everybody holla
Gettin throwed, ?stripper shows throw away a dolla?
Father, I don't want to leave nobody too blessed
Cuz they greedy in the middle of what I do best
You fixin to see me in the TV with a few guest
We bout to bubble baby, get ya waterproof vest

When we through rockin the shows, man we chase kittens

Trunk full of heat, Caribou in the seat
Frown, you can make a song. Clown in the street
Gimme the beat and we leakin
No mercy for the haters that weep

Hey, we bout to bubble, so imbedded in your psyche

Hey, B-boys hit the flo' wit it
Off in Jamaica let me see ya heel toe wit it
Clown and crunk wit it, A-Town stomp wit it
At the set, jugglettes make they double D's jump to this
House on the hill, hella tip drills
Paul Wall said he'd do me up a red grill
Busta Bus circlin' the 5-6 ville
Forty water, he told me a lot in this business for real
Stormin. In Salt Lake City performin for Mormans
Out of they garments before the mornin, I'm charmin
Leavin em torn, mess with the bull you get the horns
Nina gets with a beauty best, it's armin
Misery's behind me, labels tryin to sign me
Ain't too many who don't know just who the Tech N9ne be
Is she lookin for somethin with a future so shiny
Kansas City, Missouri is where she gone find me

Verse 1:

Never duck another mother fucker repeat it
Never duck another mother fucker
Nigga better delete it
Put the cerebellum in killa mode
For real a foe can never get
with what a gorilla know
Killa syllable fillin'
yo biblical ritual the shit to get rid of yo pain
Hearin your pitiful game, 
this is political pain
Deep in the pit of yo brain let it rain
with a unforgettable aim
Nigga lookin' for a spot to bust
Cause the homie that you killed meant a lot to us
Buck instead of lookin' for a cock to fuck
Kill a nigga like he was rockin' a swastika
You can do it but you blew it cause you lockin' up 
Get your ride on nigga is you rock or what?
Lots of luck, 
you're really gonna need it hella heated
Mother fucker let the glock erupt, Box him up

Hook:

I don't wanna be the one
to get a milla meter in the gut
I wanna be the one to hit' em with another milli
Cut up in the middle I'm a little sick
And different And I meant it 
when I said it you remember that?
(Hell mother fuckin' yeah)
You don't wanna get in trouble
With a nigga like the Teccanina
if you're lookin' like a enemy, bust
We don't ever stop and take a minute we
just...

Chorus:

(BREATHE!)
Hey son what the fuck are you duckin' from?
(BREATHE!)
They come bets to fight every fuckin one
(BREATHE!)
Say some punks around and some funkin comes
(BREATHE!)
Spray guns might result in you bustin' some
(BREATHE!)

Verse 2:

Never let a hatin' muh' fucker
see ya sweat
Bleed the chest no need regret 
A fun day caper a Sunday paper
So I can read the rest 
I can dig it you can dig it
Put a nigga in the grave 
if he hate or penetrate
the loop of love a nigga made
if you step into me
you will never benefit
Nigga if I start it Imma finish it
Run up on a mother fucka while he fuckin' a chick
Put a bullet in her head while she suckin' the dick
Wasn't a bit of evidence baby it's irrelevant
You got it with yo nigga that's the luck of the grit
Bring pain 2 everyone, in your face with the bane
You bury some, It's a mother fuckin' shame we carry guns
If you don't you insane or very dumb
Teccanina's too rough (too rough), too hard (too hard),
too tough (too tough), you scarred (you scarred)
'Cause a nigga know a mother fuckin' round will spit
Fuckin' around with the killa clown and shit.

Hook2:
If you really wanna do it nigga we can step into it
Put us up against some mother fuckers 
and we runnin' thru it
Fuck a nigga buck a nigga
if he think he's a gorilla
Meant I when I said it you remember that
(hell mother fuckin' yeah)
You don't wanna get in trouble
With a nigga like the Teccanina

Verse 3:

Get sprayed by the Tech 9 handgun
Now I'm on the out run
Flowin' the beginning hot cooked will done
Fuckin' wit a crazy insane warlord
Punks wanna trip but they know 
I'm too mother fuckin' hard
Deadly ticking like a time bomb
Fuckin' with me you were think you were in Vietnam
When I explode ain't nuttin left
but remains for those who are froze
For fuckin' wit a nigga insane
Mentally minded mad mother fuckin' mad man
is out to attack
Sinkin' punks like quick sand
droppin' and poppin'
Any punk that bucks up bring a body bag
If you wanna get fucked up
There it is you little bitch made nigga
start runnin' when I'm playin' with the trigga
of an uzi a twelve gauge, it really don't matter,
Many suckas die when the shot gun scatter
From block 2 block, hood 2 hood, street 2 street
Boy you can't fuck with me
So for those who chose to jump up and talk shit
Admit ya bitch your little ass got lit

Hook:
I don't wanna be the one
to get a milla meter in the gut
I wanna be the one to hit' em with another milli
Cut up in the middle I'm a little sick
And different And I meant it 
when I said it you remember that?
(Hell mother fuckin' yeah)
You don't wanna get in trouble
With a nigga like the Teccanina
if your lookin' like a enemy, bust
We don't ever stop and take a minute we

(Down)
Burn it down (Down), down, down, down
(Down) down, down, down, down
Burn it down (Down), down, down, down
(Down) down, down, down, down

You build me up, you build me up
To watch me fall, It's under dust
Is this the place, I used to love?
Can't take no more, I've had enough
So burn it down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Burn it down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

They lift you up and preach you
Then try to pull you down and beat you
They're no longer peaceful
Never knew a buddy would become see-through
Make it up so high, they can't reach you
They just feel the wind beneath you
Camaraderie's a plum oddity, with some modesty
People apology, who lovin' me never a dollar tree wanted
But they wanna demolish me, question mark
When they know I'm blessed at heart
Try to test Tech when I poke at they chest and bark
Givin' my blood, sweat, tears and flesh in art
But they come in my circle and make a mess, then dart
I feel like they wishin' for me to be dissin' so they can be quick and then witness me (falling down)
Gotta know that'll never happen, forever rappin'
So burning it down is the mission
Dismissin' got a brand new condition, I'm (falling down)
Kill 'em in a really clever fashion

Why would a good businessman sign a artist
And he really believes he rhymes the hardest
And spend a lot of money and time just to start it
And you think he don't want you to make it sounds ret--
Uh, Trav ain't the target, I ain't the puppet
If you got negativity boy, you better tuck it
Givin' everything and they trippin', I had enough
It, took me a while for this menace and now, fuck it
Give 'em a record deal, plus the CDs
Take 'em all on tour to give 'em the ups
Put 'em on my record, I do my verse and then I send it to them so I can give 'em the ups
In the long run, they ain't givin' a fuck
Said I ain't takin' care of my day ones
If I wasn't, they wouldn't wait to spray guns
Makin' the people think I'm wrong is way dumb, nigga
Now I'm tired, hearing my empire's (falling down)
But it's really the opposite, and I've got a clear
So many more Os, fake family, fake friends, and foes (falling down)
But Tech N9na's outta hear

It's the reason, me and Trav never had to say "We're sorry" in this business
Cause we believe if you stay righteous, you'll receive all your blessings---

Ya it's like the ultimate party favor baby ya know
two cups to get her hot and out of her clothes ya know
Caribou lou

It's like

Don't stop till the cops come

Half a bottle of 151
Off of the jug one cup of and Malibu rum
Baby that's what's up
Then you fill the rest of the jug

Unto your day go
Why I'm the one to drink it
Under the table
And all the ladies that were doing time
Want you to become a member of my drinking club
You will find Tech N9ne
Trying to tell her truly get nudey
Yes I even do el words
In the fruity bazoodi
Like to drink it and yell slurs at the movie
If I'm heated, I'm off to get a caribou lou to cool me
(created) by tech nizzle and t-wizzle
One high day.
We mixed it up
And then I say we drink caribou-bizzle like I ladie
Originated in Kansas city, Missouri
Since 19-95 baby.

Cause I'd say baby

For the rest of the night

But once I get up on 'em I can do my thing I gotta
Hey batta batta batta batta swa-ing a batta

[Intro: Some guys talking]
The spiked red hair...and the..and the, paint on his face
Whow, hold on man, Tech is losein' it man

You know you see a black dude with red hair
And a long beard, I mean look he look scary to me too
Yeah that nigga Tech man he sellin' out man
That..that's he's doin' that for the white folks
That white shit he doin' man

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]

Nineteen years for sure

And then compare me to Nelly (What ya bang bra)
So this songs is gonna tell me so called gangster Niggas, who the fuck has always been the bigger G?
Hey, I've been bustin'

(Rap at niggas constantly they never know the money Nina makes)
Hey, this is amazin' how niggas formulate they hatin'

Who's keepin' this shakin', huh
(Got any questions Sinister Tech and Tecca Nina niggas know the rest)
Gay, is all you punks and mitch bades this in your trunk won't get played on the radio
Too gangster for an old lady bro
Gangster niggas don't hate me no
Wanks niggas won't face me though
(Talkin' shit and books my people tellin' me that I really need a vest)
OK

[Bridge 1: Tech N9ne]
I rep the town harder than any of you niggas
Where ever I stand my bills the same punk
And you got the nerve to tell me

[Hook: Tech N9ne]
Come gangster
Throw your rags in the air
And know that nobody there
Will compare to your gangster
Saggin' pants to the floor
Every womens a bitch or a whore
When your gangster

If they shrug to them thugs mean mug ya come gangster
Is what they sayin' to me

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I should've been done come wit a gun
For the ones who bump they gums who the one
Said a nigga wasn't gonna make another record said I was wack and washed up done
Said a nigga might scare little' ones
He's a fuckin' nightmare, here he comes
Really red hair and my face painted
They said (Gangster)
Messy Marvin Coleone is so (Gangster)
But I really ain't (Gangster)
I need to come a little (Gangster)
Scratch the scratch the nigga fat tone is so (Gangster)

They say
When you in them streets, creep creep
Cause some gangsters want a head blast
Cause I run with the red rags
And try make the feds flash
Try to swipe my bread stash
(That's that bullshit I'm gonna' skip and try to go get the money grip)
OK, you niggas kill me in Nosferatu vampire bit my shit
Cause you niggas fill me surprised that I got you right here with my shit
So you gotta be thankful to who?
By the way homie what's gangster to you?
(Money, dope and alcohol and plenty bitches all up on your dick)

How can C-Bo be wrong?
How can Yukmouth be wrong?
How can Lynch be wrong?
How can 2Pac be wrong? Bitch!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I've been nice to you rapper cats for a long time
I left Kansas City so them other cats can gonna' shine
But it seems these punks are confused because I'm my own kind
But I'm back on deck cause Kansas City is who's throne? Mine!
This ain't no punk shit
Nigga this is strength at it's finest
I made this shit so you all you sins can rewind it
Meaning, you pussys who says this Tech shit ain't hard for real
And try to disregard the real
You motherfuckers is hard to feel
I get your death threats cause I'm the king bitch
Money, groupies, drugs, alcohol and bling shit
But I stay a hella game
And you punks is so lame
Cause my mobbin' gangster track will demolish your whole tank
I've been with every rapper who's legendary
Underground to mainstream know that Tech is very hard
Cause I bring the heater
Love me cause I'm your leader
Bitches they suck my peter
While I drinkin' Margaritas
Niggas get laid down
Seven displayed sounds
N9ne the crayzed clown
Lines like sprayed rounds
This is for all you haters who don't pump my shit
If you say this ain't gangster then you can suck my dick!
I might look like a clown
But you niggas sound like a motherfuckin' circus
Fuck you motherfuckers!

[Outro: Yukmouth]
This nigga is the tightest nigga movin' man
I mean...Tech N9ne will demolish all you niggas
From the stage show, to rockin' the mic you name it
Thats why I roll wit him he my favorite rapper real talk

Damn, uh, sorry to hear about your moms, man

Techalicious, this is Wendy Dae

I'm so, so, so, so, so sorry

Hey this your brother Chris, man
Sorry to hear about you moms, man

Hey this is Cook right here

And gimme a call, lemme know something, okay?
I'll be waiting to hear from you---

[Chorus]
If there is a final hour
Let's hope for a higher power
1 by 1 and 2 by 2
I have ammo what about you [x2]

[Verse 1]
Grandma told me the good book said
in the last days get ready for the ten plagues
1st the rivers will be ran with red
2, 3, and 4 dead frogs will cause lice and flies
sick livestock is 5 the living they must fight for their lives
6, 7, and 8 a boil storms a fire and locusts
9 is darkness so dark it's hard for you to focus
and 10 is death of the firstborn
If I said it was questionable the religions would make it a point
to get at me and battle me maybe have this verse torn
How will this curse form?
Well creation is a bendarwinism{?}
been at it forever bout at it I got nothin but hurt for em
Cuz really nobody knows when you live then you die where your body goes
if it's Hell or it's Heaven
6 or the 7 well I'll keep the nina for our be foes in a gamble
that's what life is and it's hard to handle
when the bible says worship this by the scriptures written by man though
So when man destroys us the word might not stand so
till that day I'm just gon protect my fam with ammo

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ive been looking for something supernatural for a long time now
but I never got proof that a spiritual realm existed wanted to find how
everybody sure of a supreme being, are people just seeing things?
wondering if we get wings, seems sick to believe in an extreme king
I know it sounds far fetched, every night i put knees on the carpet
then I pray to who's up with the star set
cuz the earth in its self is a target
for destruction, for cumbustion
cuz there aint too many you can trust in
think of all the women losing their husbands
in Iraq a lot of killing and suffering
what i hope for, seems folklore
when the enemy kills and gloat more
cuz they killin us off in this hoax war
then I wake up yellin and my throats sore
cuz the fight's there, its a nightmare
if it come to me I'm in my snipe wear
if a bullet give my lung a slight tear
I wanna believe that the light's there
so all you christians don't get mad at me
i just hope that your mystical, magical miracle's workin catastrophies
and this ain't blasphemy, but artillery is my strategy
I hope for a higher power when i look at all these tragedies

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
oh what a miracle, angels and demons
but the only miracle is that people keep believing
right hand on the bible, left hand on my rifle
keep that for my rivals and evil deciples
expand your mission, man to women
when they attack do you plan to give in
or do you do like i do and say praise the lord and pass the ammunition
people like us
piece and knife up
cuz we got evil to sweep and wipe up
devils and demons and humans, irrelavent
if they looking deceiving i bust
I hope that the higher power is watching over me
cuz we young people don't see faith like most the older see
if he or she is listening
a mere sign can spark me
but if the laws in the bible are bogus
then prepare for anarchy
worst case scenario is there never ever was a higher power
so in the midst of chaos now
the only real savior is fire power

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by mitch.

Man lives
In a sun lit world
Of what he believes to be reality
But
There is unseen by most
An underworld that is just as real
But not as brightly lit a
DARKSIDE

[Chorus]
I can write a verse and take the sun away... DARKNESS
Say good bye to light bcause it's gone today... DARKNESS
Ain't no smiling happiness is done away... DARKNESS
Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away... DARKNESS

[Tech N9ne]
I don't really give of fuck what you think of me I had it up to here. yep.
Follow me into another de-mention of insanity's right here. step...
I know your feelin it I'm lovein you when I'm kissin n fuckin you n in a minute I'm a veer
Left.

An by the pluck of the jugular see the blood of my lover and then I finish when your near

Death.

I'm sorry but I mean it cause when I got the tool on bitch I got bulimic up in her like a

Gynecologist with a penis

And when they bled on me I was giddy and never squeamish.

Bad as a demon I cannot get rid of her I really rely on the feelin of the sex an the red of a

Woman.

Can I take a bite of your cerebellum I think it'll really get me up if I could be suckin your

Seratonin.

I'd rather just die than inflict any pain on somebody who truly put trusted me.

Better yet I just make her the suffer who taught me mocked me n fucked with me.

Maybe get up in the club and shoot it up and makem panic at the disco... (backwards)

I can paint a dark picture.

You don't want me to start with, cha.

Don't want me commin with the heart, hit cha.

Chew you up and if you really tart, spit cha.

After the brain I put the lemon moraine in.

Blood of a dame is what I drain my fang's in.

Takein the spirit and the body it came in.

Away from the sun n forever you can remain in.

[Chorus x2]

[Dirtball]

When I'm all up on a pallet a pain with blood of my name in vain sun up in it

Imna break it down the walls n try to stop me from poppin my gun up in it

Skits onta me honor me for the time never given to the rhyme in another mind lookin like a

Nice guy

Behind the face be the beast of another mutha fucka that be heard the least.

So many here me when I say they can, that I remember everybody that layd me astray. yo fuckem.

Nobody but my closest know about my darkness and when they fall away. yo fuckm.

I'm to sick that I never checked outa my mental-ward working in sweden

Burin the bodies this song made my memory feedm ghost made me loud and I'm proud I can see them

I don't even wanna talk about it but I do it for the demons and the devils alive

Hopein that the nonbelievers get a number two in the eye please try to die save me the time

When I make a move when I'm commin through I'm a stay devoted to rhyme [x9]

Devoted to mine hex sign ruda wicked I'm a be forever de-dine

Picture this my wrist silt pissed off I'm hangin from a meat hook,

Yo I'm bangin on a meat hook it's the twist this chapter ya miss the darker the venom of a

Main hook book

I'm tellin everybody I'm not doin so well I'm feelin my noggin to you better watch ya self

Sub-noise when I'm bangin on a tech set best believe the dark times are here my lips eclipse

Everything

[Chorus x2]

I'm your worst fear.
I'm your favorite.
I'm your acquired taste.
Will you savor it.
If it blood thirst will you run from it.
No need cause I'm inside of you.
When the sun is spit.
You cannot escape me I'm your last resort your.
When you have a evil you cannot report.
I'm your royal sunshine malicious and heartless.
If ever you need an alibi rely on me I am.

DARKNESS

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Shannon.

Let me show you how fast I can get to your heart

Awh shit here we go again

[Intro: Tech N9ne]
When you met her
She was right so thick
Something better then a wife, no glitch
She won't stop ever, but she might go click
If you leave her you'll see a PSYCHO BITCH
Now she's callin your crib, at nights so sick
Wanna pop up and try ta fight your chick
Lorena Bobbitt, Told her to slice yo dick
If you Ever break up with a Psycho bitch

[Verse I: Tech N9ne]
Don't give me that shit
But a nigga don't care, never could it be fair
Then I was up in a middle lover
Came a double dare when
I woke up
I was in a Mutha fuckin nightmare
How you ganna fuck me on Sunday
Then you wanna say you love me on Monday
You buggin, 
Thinking everybody gotta bow down because your off in your lovin'
If your on your telephone
And then she lose it when you use it
If sleep, don't leave it on, nigga, for true she will go though with it
She call a bitch back from your phone and chew the chick a new uterus
Even if that situation not lewd the bitch is ludicrous
Bad when you gotta better bitch around
Sad cause you never wanna kiss her now
Never would got up in the women
If I knew about menace
And now never wanna take her down
If she take her seroquel, and selects
The bitch would probably stop and then try to catch yea
Slipin with a beauty itchin to get chya
You betta hope you neva leavin the stretcha
If you with a psycho
Don't go thought with it
Be throught with it
Right in the midst of happiness
Her mood will switch and ruin it.
You thinking you know women and your just so intuitive
Bet that a nigga, 
That in back, 
At the end of this
You will have to shoot a bitch

[Chorus:]

The way you sit around the corner from my house is scary though
Psycho bitch is when it comes to relationships are very slow

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne, Liquid Assassin]
[Tech N9ne:]

Psycho bitches are self-destructive, weak, and helpless
I'm done with you Bitch, now you can let somebody else spit... 
[Liquid Assassin:]
She's so sick with it, I stick hit it, and dick fit it
Never did I think for a minute to quit, quit it
Chickens on the livin, and trippin to get hit it
Turn around flip and then get you into deep shitted
Pussy was imbedded and get it your indebted
You could make a penny or money the man said it
You can run a bitch by adjusting the antennas
But if she demand it your betta forget it
She's Psycho like Michael
You might go and wake up to knives and rifles
When your eyes closed she's liable
Like I know to move on you like Tae Bo
Even I know this sly hoe like rivals
Been turn you into five-Oh
Either that and your turn your back
And the bitch attack with a blade up in your spinal
Should have listen to phone call, just stop with them harassing threats
My envision was them draws and me plottin on having sex

If you look at nina closly I'm tryina contain this beast within. I know some
Of yall already knowin that I got alota cheese to spend but that don't
Change the fact I go insane I gotta heap of sins please begin.

I saw a glimspse in all of this when I was just yay tall and I pictured
Yall and it wall to wall but they all said I was just Delusional but the
People startin callin us and I'm ballin tough but the crawlin rough and I
Never though of stuff with saw enough. what the problem is now I got em
Here tellin all these kids I'm the K.O.D and they pumpin up the volume and
Listenen hard when I give my heart is it Delusional.
When I'm thinkin ima boss in the biz but I'm lost and I fake it that I'm off
In the lid but they pay the cost when it is dark at the crib

Some say that if tell them to hate my people are at the gate ready for
Sealin your fate that is up for debate cause when I make my music aint no
Evil from mister yates callin me
A cult leader I don't really know but ima fosho heater wickedness commin
From mine rove they could blow me but the folks wanna soul see us at the
Bottom with the devil look around and it be no N9na they say I lead em to
Evil like I was jimmy jones and feedin the people when I bleed in the
Steeple the reason they seizin me aint no decreasin my ego my powers for
Good I think would I shrink if somebody took away how good I ink but that
Would never happen I'm makin it with the rappin but they want me to collapse
And when I could I sink

(Chorus) Nikkiya

I hope I find what I'm looking for, maybe I should drink just a little more.
Delusional
I'm fightin but I'm losin feel like the author of confusion Hear me!
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life and confusion seems to be my
Alibi. Delusional I'm feelin like I don't belong, feel like I'm tellin you to
Do wrong hear me!

(Verse 2)

She feel like I'm, gonna make them hate because I was around and kick it and
Make them babys and now that I made it gotta escape them daily and that's
Crazy cause all I'm doin is makin the industry pay me but when I show my
Face feelin everythings great did a show then we ate then I'm outa that
State she said I'm a good provider but daddy of the year man I'm outa that
Race how I compensate for the losses they get often dates that's too
Personal we'll stop the tape

(Chorus) Nikkiya

I hope I find what I'm looking for, maybe I should drink just a little more.
Delusional
I'm fightin but I'm losin feel like the author of confusion Hear me!
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life and confusion seems to be my
Alibi. Delusional I'm feelin like I don't belong, feel like I'm tellin you to
Do wrong hear me!

(Verse 3)

They say I'm seein things but everybody know I'm bein things we dem kings
Like it or not we runnin this gotta lotta hype cause I wanna spit and I
Come to grip on the fith you gotta know techs never gonna miss I know I
Might be a little psycie but it's nightly and brightly inside of me makin me
A little frightening rippin it with the right team I bring hella light when
Resighting when it's all said and done I'm sickened and heavened caused this
A damned reverend ALL 6'S AND 7'S

(Chorus) Nikkiya

I hope I find what I'm looking for, maybe I should drink just a little more.
Delusional
I'm fightin but I'm losin feel like the author of confusion Hear me!
My rights and wrongs are questioned in my life and confusion seems to be my
Alibi. Delusional I'm feelin like I don't belong, feel like I'm tellin you to
Do wrong hear me! ---Lyrics submitted by Highman.

[Chorus:]
When I was 1 and a 2 and a 3 and a 4
I knew I was a special one who had a little more
And they wondered why I was plotting, rotten to the core

Can I kill it (hell naw)

There's a demon inside a me can I kill it (hell naw)

Livin the evil up in the fast lane (chaa)
Makin me wanna have ? beatin the hell outta people makin me mad mayne (chaa)

Voted me to be really heartless (ehr)
All up in my spirt they march they makin me start sparkin at the targets (ehr)

Verse 1
Who the hell is Satan?
And why I gotta be'em?
I ain't worshipped Nathan
So why you gotta see'em?
When you look at me is it the Imagery?
It's gotta godly evils not my energy
I pose as angels clothes is mangled
Instead of girbeaus and kangols
The ho's still dangle I chose the angle 
of souls who tangle
With foe's those who stain 
yo brain so bane though painful
Shit is what they like, hit is what they might
Spit his stuff in life, shit is fuckin' tight
But some people think it's an evil experiment
Some people is fearin' it, 
those who do Beatles is hearin' it
Sincerity is neezle sin
People who look and never listen
They thinkin' that I'm the tyranny of evil men
But I just tell it like it is dude
My life story's quite gory
spittin' even if it is rude
So ain't no brimstone I ain't Jim Jones
So put your grins on listen to them songs
And you will see that they be classics
Verbal gymnastics you call me Lucifer
go to hell you bastard

Chorus

They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
The way I come is sick
and I'm on some other level boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
Cause I am not the everyday
I'm not no mellow boy
They call me devil boy, they call me devil boy
And those who know me
yes they know that I am well annoyed
They call me devil boy, if you call me devil boy
You're going to all burn in hell

Verse 2

Hot Christians pop my disc in
Stop the dissin', squat and listen
I never say hail Satan
I'll never bail out and sell out 
and sell gay drama 
Hey mama they trying to crucify me like Jesus
Religious groups deny me like skeezers
We mic pleasers rip it and write heaters
Niggas that ain't pleased
with quickness are light readers
I said Anghellic, then let the man sale it
I let the fans smell it, then I expand relish
But the devil tried to stop me that's JCOR
They thought I'd crumble
when it's rocky and stay poor
Deus Vobiscum we playas go get some sprayers
And hits'em with layers of slayer inscriptions
That mean God be with you 
we split dude then hit you
With pistols whip you
then giggle never dissing nizzle again
I talk about the rain, I talk about the sun
about the pain, I speak about the fun
I'm sayin' that I'm bad, I'm sayin that I'm good
I'm saying this to the suburnites and every hood
Yaw act like I'm sayin' 
(I love Lucifer I will kill all of you)
Mother Fucker I ain't step into the lime light
To devil worship in front of kids,
get yo mind right

Chorus

Verse 3
They call me devil boy
But I don't like that
Those who recite that
That's where the fights at
Cause Imma tight cat
Who hella write rap
Even a slight crack
And I'll be right back
To the devil worshipers at my signings thinkin'
I'm narly (huh)
I just wanna go to your parties 
So I can run thru all your goth bitches
and rock bitches
Take'em on the block and now they 2Pac bitches
I love the dark side with horror
Got archives I'm sure
You got hard lives 
Missourah is our side 
and it's hella depressin' hella a stressin'
Retrogression back to depression 
a hell of a lesson
This where it gets more sick
Don't respect poor pricks
Who listen to this album and then say exorcist
You dense, hence the word Ang it means good
Hellic it means bad
you didn't catch it you should have
Idiots make me wanna bust it (rebel toys) 
Tried to explain now I say fuck it (several ploys)
Foolish title I can't touch it (devil boy)
Cause I talk backwards (suseJ sevol uoy)

Is it true, I can only fly so high?
Without wings, I truly die

If you trace it back to the beginnin'
I never sold a single piece of music before Mitch Bade
This layed, the foundation for me to get paid
This day, you can still hear that gangster on a sick page
Now I'm flyin' high but dyin', my
Fans that were buyin' I
They're cryin', "Why
Does he have to get bigger and flow with artists from mainstream?"
Good music reaches all and he's creating a strange scene

How, far up can I go
Before you say you love me?
You love me not?
You love me?
You love me not?
I'm flying but I'm dying faster
Hoping you won't go away

How the hell are you sayin' that all the records I'm playin'
Since 2010 are not obeyin' the Strange Law
Remain raw, give your happy and pain all
Spit with a flame jaw with the teeth of a chainsaw
This what I do when I'm flyin' right off the shelf
And when something musical helps
You can't keep it all to yourself
It grows and grows, always hard never tryin' soft
So how in the world you fix your face to say that you dyin' off

Frustrated, cause I'm thinkin' that if enough hated
It'll make remaining fans start feelin' their trust faded

I don't wanna die, I just wanna keep my lifeline
And that's the family who recite N9ne's passages
And back it just cause ain't no other like mine (tight rhymes)
And even the people applaud
They still wanna bury hard, cause they don't wanna be a god
I'm higher than the stars now
The bottom is too far down
Whoever throws sand at the Nina
Yeah it kinda cuts but it ain't enough to take me down
I've been so true, so things I do will go my way
With the power of the pen, the paper, the people do as I say

My fans are my lifeline, so it kills me to think how they can just cut off

There can only be one

Thou shall only be me
And the whole world's changing
All shall remain

I'm flying higher more and more everyday
But lately, I've been feelin' like I should just fly away...---

[Intro]
First entry for Sickology 101, Dysfunctional

[Tech N9ne]
Yeah
Don't you bring me nothing stupid
If you don't want me to lose it
Step back if you don't want me to attack
I'm a beast, Better give me the deuces

I have no tolerance for nonsense
Get away from me
Me don't wanna get dollars
Don't wanna holler but you makin me
I'm a little dysfunctional
You're the problem, Please don't awakin me
And I'm that way cause back in the day
Most have forsaken me

Lodi dodi, I'm at the party
On a drunk night with a punk
Might dude wanna pick a fight because he's sorry...
That he aint Gotti, Like I be
Cause he sloppy, Not me
Costly rocks be spot free

But he don't know I'm roguish
Surrounded by my soldiers
And they be locked and loaded
Will explode if you can't hold us
And we don't got no scruples
We didn't come to fight and shoot you
But you busters better be mutual
Don't get loose because we cuckoo

Listen, They call me genius, I run the show
Woman be on my penis, It's wonderful
Demons think they the meanest
But I brung the foe on the flow
Little bit sick, Don't you know?

[Hook: Big Krizz Kaliko]
I'm a little dysfunctional, Don't you know?
If you push me, It might be bad
Get a little emotional, Don't you know?
You could fool around and make me mad
I'm a little dysfunctional, Don't you know?
If you push me, It might be bad
Get a little emotional, Don't you know?
Might fool around and make me mad
Don't make me mad

[Big Scoob]
Born to hustle
I'm a product of environment
The game done changed
So I've been forced into retirement
But I make moves and I paid dues
And I got common sense
Since I can't lose and I can't choose
Then I'll come back to spit
I got hit songs but I've been gone so long that I don't fit
Near death, Dethrone but can't get on
So I need me a lick
I write these songs but don't belong
I'm on some other shit
I'm huntin leads in desperate need
I hope it's comin quick
I'd wrap my brain to find a lane
That's gon' bring me some change
But it's so strange, My life has changed
And I am not the same
I come around but since I'm down
It feels uncomfortable
I try to hide it deep inside but I'm dysfunctional
I never learned to hold it in
I gets emotional
First, Implode then explode
I'm combustible
So please don't push to play me, pussy
On some real shit, Won't be defeated
If I'm heated, nigga
Oh shit!

[Hook: Big Krizz Kaliko]
I'm a little dysfunctional, Don't you know?
If you push me, It might be bad
Get a little emotional, Don't you know?
You could fool around and make me mad
I'm a little dysfunctional, Don't you know?
If you push me, It might be bad
Get a little emotional, Don't you know?
Might fool around and make me mad
Don't make me mad

[Big Krizz Kaliko]
I aint no killer but don't push me
Qu-Qu-Qu-Quiet boy never been no pussy
Could be carrying something up under my hoody
Course me never snap and kill a baller, y'all
Or would he?

Now I wanna be peaceful
But I carry Desert Eagles where ever black people are
You know how black people are
I peep 'em out, Try to stay evened out
Wanna preach to 'em but their evil keep on seepin out
Emotions get the best of me
Messed up and then y'all get the rest of me
Depressed and stressed, Feel like my destiny
I know y'all think less of me
Cause I'm always sick and I can't let it be
Pharmaceutical soup be the best recipe
It's gon' be the death of me

I need Depakote just to cope 
While I keep throwin them pills down my throat

Dysfunctional blunts will do
Smokin Bombay can give me Fung Shui
But I wish that it all would go away
Or maybe I should pray for Jesus Christ
To just un-pretzel me
Tryin to pray for change
But sometimes it feel like he lets it be
So I just take another couple doses
Probably be fine but if you get too close
You'll find out that I...

[Hook: Big Krizz Kaliko]
I'm a little dysfunctional, Don't you know?
If you push me, It might be bad
Get a little emotional, Don't you know?
You could fool around and make me mad

If you push me, It might be bad
Get a little emotional, Don't you know?
Might fool around and make me mad

But you arrest me
When I'm selling my dope
So who's the Einstein
In N9NE N9NE
TECH N9NE
I'm crime mind
In my prime
I'm mixing
One fifty-one
With Malibu rum
And pineapple juice
Among all my angels
And wicked ones
We're the party people
Night and day
Living crazy is the only way
Einstein
When I'm on it
Einstein
Rock it
Like you mutha fuckers want it

[Hook]

Who got this
Mutha fucking house

[3rd Verse]

What do we say
To haters off top
Haters got beef
They thinking we got
We gon get postal
If it don't stop
You can get ghost
Or you can get shot
Generation X
Gon party till the death
Anybody tripping
Gettin greeted with a stretch
Taking everything
And we're leaving nothing left
Demons gotta die
Have 'em breathing last breaths
I feel that
I got will
And I'm gon bill
Till I'm killed
Bell till I bail
If I fail
Then I'm gon steal
What I will
TECH is a realist
Running with killas
You better vill this
Be the witness
To the coldest
When I hold this dick
They break camp
When I flow this
Einstein go the ill route
Throw up your hands
If you're villed out
Or if you're real sauced
I told ya'll I'm cold
Dog I flows
All heat
I'm representing

[Tech N9ne]
Mmm
Yum, a stick of 5 gum is the taste on my tongue
But for the right one, I’ll spit it out and place her right on
The night’s young, meaning we minus the bright sun
And I’m numb like I’m inside ‘em like white on a ripe bun
Like that one, baby stacked wit’ a fat one
Action-pack wit’ a rack and a little bit of that ‘yac she’s passed on
Got a 36-pack of Magnums, I’m Vlad and I’m back
I’ll put a bitch in a sack and bring her back
And then I gotta go and leave a lash from the passion

(I’m crazy) Sick as hell for the ladies
They don’t give a damn that I’m manic
Even though I’m so shady
Baby girl, but don’t play me
I ain’t tryna have no babies, but baby
You braised in some slavery

Wanna excite ya, ignite the fight, so honey, taunt me
I just wanna bite you and watch you drip out Romanee-Conti
That’s 11 Gs, angel from heaven, she’s
Seven threes, hot egg and cheese for Pain, Tech and Weez

[T-Pain]
I know what you sayin’
But you know I ain’t playin’
Tryna get my dick sucked through my jeans
And oh-oh

(Girl sure look like fuck food to me)
(Girl sure look like fuck food to me)

Spin that booty ’round, drop it to the ground, let it make a sound, do-do it, baby
Do it like that, lemme see the kitty-kat, then I hit it from the back for the baby

(Girl sure look like fuck food to me)
(Girl sure look like fuck food to me)

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Lil Wayne]
Uh, now put that pussy on my lip and dip
Yeah, let’s make a movie, I’ma flip the script
Yeah, I wax that ass like Q-Tip
Yeah, float in that pussy like a cruise ship
Uh, ’cause I’m a nasty motherfucker
Yeah, I eat that pussy like the last supper
Yeah, I beat that pussy like brass knuckles
Heh, she call me daddy and she scream “Uncle”
Open up and spread, I’m pullin’ her hair, she pullin’ my dreads
I’m breakin’ her off, we breakin’ the bed
Fuck her like a dog, she shakin’ her leg
I’m killin’ it soft, I’m makin’ it red
I’m makin’ her talk, I’m makin’ her beg
I’m makin’ her crawl, I’m makin’ her run
I’m makin’ it numb, I’m makin’ it cum, I am
Young Weezy F. Baby
She wish she could make a copy of my dick and save it
(Ha-ha) Now close your mouth, don’t waste it
I got that fuck food, baby, come taste it
Tunechi!

[T-Pain]
I know what you sayin’
But you know I ain’t playin’
Tryna get my dick sucked through my jeans
And oh-oh
(Girls sure look like fuck food to me)
(Girl sure look like fuck food to me)
Spin hat booty ’round, drop it to the ground, let it make a sound, do-do it, baby
Do it like that, lemme see the kitty-kat, then I hit it from the back for the baby
(Girl sure look like fuck food to me)
(Girl sure look like fuck food to me)

Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Tech N9ne]
When I get my mittens on this kitten
She’ll be bitten, then she missin’
‘Cause she fucked up and let the Tech in
Canceled all of her ex-men
If you think you got it, nigga, say it witcha chest, then
I’m gon’ be your sex friend, rippin’ off her dress, then
Nibblin’ on her neck and I’m makin’ her wet wit’ no question
Yeah, animal magnetism, the sadomasochism
Got way mo’ cash to give ‘em, but they don’t ask, just twist ‘em
I don’t have to give ‘em stacks for me to mash within ‘em
I’m they master, hit ‘em with a lash and a nigga fast to stick ‘em
And I like ‘em all colors, multi-mack can make ‘em all love us
And make ‘em do all of us, and we don’t be trippin’ on it ’cause we all brothers
Y’all slippers, as I be trippin’ over broads, fuck it
The currency, see he keep his cards shuffled
The bitch’ll wanna let her jaws touch us, jaw-crushers
Anybody outside don’t get much news from me
‘Cause I get it in but I keep it on the hush (Who’s the G?)
This rush, you agree, this is stuff dude for fee
But the girls sho’ look like fuck food to me, ay

I don’t know what you feel
I don’t know what you think
I don’t know what you see, my nigga

(girl sure look like fuck food to me)
(girl sure look like fuck food to me)
I know what you sayin’
But you know I ain’t playin’
Tryna get my dick sucked through my jeans
And oh-oh
(girl sure look like fuck food to me)

Spin that booty ’round, drop it to the ground, let it make a sound, do-do it, baby
Do it like that, lemme see the kitty-kat, then I hit it from the back for the baby
(girl sure look like fuck food to me)
(girl sure look like fuck food to me)

Now you see what I see
The lady’s mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
Now you see what I see (can you see?)
The lady’s mine, mine, (she's mine), mine, mine, (she's mine), mine ---Lyrics submitted by Chris Averill.

Back up wait a minute
Why you looking at me like that
Do you really wanna trip, are you flipping the script?
Do you wanna rap with a nigga?
Are we bangin' so whoop in a rip?
I don't ever want us to come the bustin' off shots, nigga misery can't produce enough cops and
Don't know if you willin' or what?
All you wanna do is freestyle in the cut
Fan or foe I don't really know
Off at the show niggas they know
what I look like, was a good night
now it's looking like a motherfucker wanna jack all me doe
Come up to me
My kids would be chillin'
Better think twice I'm a 5-6 villain
All they wanna talk about
I did it
When I did it
Man I thought I was gonna get a bullet in a minute
You should be careful how you walk upon us
Got a bonus for all the opponents if they want it
I know they wait for Tecca Ninna moments
Till the opponent be poppin' up and he's you don't it
We don't if they be tripin' or not (no)
Probably 'cause all of them live on the block
When you're rapping niggas know what you got
Toughest ever, when you up on the top
Show some respect when you approach me
Don't you be mugging me?
Might have that drug in me
Plugging a nigga, for nearly shrugging me
Ain't nothing wrong with people peeping, geeking
Whether man or hoe
But the grandma so bama, stama
I don't know if you fan or foe

[Chorus]

If he trippin', we can go
Peeping like he's seeking doe
Want to throw or want to poe
I don't know if you fan or foe
I don't know if you fan or foe
I don't know if you fan or foe
Easy, how you're speakin' bro'
I don't know if you fan or foe

If he trippin' trippin' go
Peepin', seekin' seekin' doe
Want to throw or poe, poe
I don't know if you fan or foe
I don't know if you fan or foe
I don't know if you fan or foe
Easy speakin, speakin bro'
I don't know if you fan or foe

Now be easy how you're speakin' bro'
T-Nutty, a young flow heathin', don't be chokin'
So your ass and you'll be walkin' off with it broken
Run up on motherfuckers in the open
Making them shut up
Woofing with that cold shit
Cut the shinanigans
Nigga you think this is with manikans
Thinking you're slicker than lotion
Back up wait a minute why you're looking at me like that
I'm just a nigga with a little bit of fame but if you get the tripping' than I'm giving up my game
Never catch me slippin'
You can get it out your brain
Maine Fan or Foe!
Some kinda nigga tryin' to get his hands on my doe
But if you really want come on
And try to get on, you can be the opponent chokin' with hands on your throat
Man I'm a low
Wantin' a background for Sac Town
Better watch out from the Blao Blao
Black out, black out, black out, black out (braararararaa ttataaaaa)
Stay with my killers that be knockin' noodles
Wakin' the game the blood at goca doodle
Thinkin' you're gonna catch me slippin' at a show
Fear factor click is like a shaker Zulu
I see through you
With all that fake shit
You've filled with hatrid
Hoping and wishin' you was my replacement
Coming so vicious you're gonna have to face it
And try to taste it
'cause I laced it like a tennis shoe when I've been a fool
Like Zeepo bitch and X-Raided
But this is a different interview

[Chorus Repeat]

It might not be a bad idea
If I never go home again
'cause niggas be lookin' at me
Like I'm a chicken dinner
Like like I'm ?? Henderson?
You a foe (foe), so I gotta carry the fo' (four)
And did they recognize me, I don't really know though
'cause they walkin' up fast
And givin' me doubt
When they pass me asking
When your new shit come out (me and my dogs)
At the picture house
And the be huddled up and got me I think I'm gonna pick one out, and get the nigga bigger than me
For the trigger to see
If he tough enough
Make it what he trying to be
But he's a fan though
Don't know how to approach you, vulture
Get to close, how I'm supposed to...
(...supposed to know the difference between fan or foe when you're muggin' on me...)

Can't even live in peace
And when I eat with my peeps In the place
You in my face with your mix-tapes
And if I ain't tryin' to listen to it
We get in to it
If I'm off on the fluid
Then it's time to do it (do it)

Uhhhh... 'cause a nigga from out south out the mouth
Your girl be loving me giving me mouth to mouth (yeah)
And it ain't fair that the music got her doing what she wanna do when you ain't there

And you're too softy, softy when you see me you better get up off me

[Chorus Repeat]---Lyrics submitted by Josh.

Show this, stressful, everybody wanna call,
Gotta tell em now, sometimes
Sit up in the record store
Seven hundred fans, man, everyone signs
And it gets so hard telling em all please try to form one line
But the player-haters combine
I don't think you know
How much of a strain it's been
I can't explain
It's insane
But I wouldn't give up a thang
Live with the pain
And resort to brain trippin'
I need a little release,
Something to stop my rage
I really need me a moment of peace
So baby girl wanna step on stage

Flash
Like its mardi gras
Flash,
Girl take off your bra
Flash,
Talking to all of you all
Flash,
This is a party call
Flash
Theres song ain't about your
ass
But I really love it when you
Pass
If you want me we can
Smash
My Baby doll
[x2]

I really love it,
I can see them from the front row to the back
And it's beautiful, I've imagined this
Since I was a you, now that I'm
Old enough
Girls that are
Small enough
Grab your shirts
Roll it up
Even if you an A-cup girl, we can still play touch
If you a B and C cup, girl I bet you could make me erupt
D Cups, be the ones that are driving me nuts
Big breasts never trouble me
If you packing the double D,
Let everyone S double E
Angelina Jolie, let me see those
Beautiful babies I'm all about the tedos
Miss Jackson packing them holy toledos
Missed the flash cause I didn't have Tivo
Ask me who's finer, player I'm gonna yell Tyra
Little sick in the head, still got the magazine of El Vira
Life is so grand, when you got your fans
Blasting off their shirts, flashing their Lindsay Lohan's
I got a pocket full of Trojans,
We can all get nasty if you flash me baby,
You know the program

[Chorus x2]

Girls in the back, come to the front
Cause we in need of cleavage
And I've been looking at you,
Yep you and your home girl
Let me see both of them, now grab a hold of them
Look at what you're doing to me
Now grab a hold of him

Ah, such a nice sensation
You know the dogs been waiting
For you to quickly take off your Vickie
And show me your augmentation
Silicone or saline,
Either one puts me in a day dream
Talking about it gets me way steamed
Baby girl, this regime
When you see me, baby lift it up
Thinking I'm gonna miss it, nigga, what?
if I miss one (back it up)

From city to city crazy
(stit elur eht dlrow)
Tig 'ol bitties, lady
From city to city crazy

[Chorus x2]

Traveling for miles and miles
Girls gone wild love this peculiar style
So in order for us to get our head right
We need all your ladies
To turn on your headlights

who blast vegas, yo this is for the freaks baby patite ladys even my sellulite ladys, this is tech n9ne baby!

when i was five years old my uncle snuck me into a drive in show,
got in without paying i hid behind jimmy and babe row,
a triple ex flick diddnt even know what i was in for.

yo i seen some things that made me feel kida funny inside, i seen some things that my momma wouldnt want me to see at this size,
i seen some stuff home boyz in the back were huffin and puffin windows foggy didnt know
when i came of age id be gluttin for muffins homeboy when i seen this i really mean this

(i was really shocked)
and my team mate was really fiendish
(it got really hot)

fealing blanket a lil squimish
(i didnt want it to stop)
my uncle said now chance dont piss your pants evrybody laughed that was there to watch.

went back to school yo the next day,
didnt look at home girlz, the same way,
started askin neighbors can they girlz come out to play instead of hide and go seek its hide and go get it with no delay.

i grew this thing called freaky aw sex on my brain its was the best thing, 
i cought it when i was young and aunry just a baby havin nasty dreams.
i heard it was a zodiac thing they say scorpios are know to be freaks,
i see somthing lookin good i say dwaam (dwaam)and when i see that ass hop i get gee!(get gee!)

time kept on movin on my shellish clothes, 
fly looking at young girlyz singing a tailess woe,
i already sinning hopin that hell is cold, 
n9ne lost his virginity when he was twelve years old

with a girl name marleen,
me and her were starving,
for eachother under the covers cooped up like sardins,
my hard thing started barging thaught it was retarded when it spit on her
we started to arguing.

heres a message to the young folks,
(dont try this at home)
dont start in earlie like tech n9ne
(wait till you are grown)

when i was in high school i would wake up in the morning after i took a shower,
id put on a non lubircated condom cuz it could be on at any hour.

and my brain is like a disease,(disease)
i see a fine girl walking by im on her like freaze(freaze,freaze)
i aint got to let her know im right here so i got chease(chease,chease)
all she gotta do is look into my eyez get her hypnotised and watch her open them legs.

i grew this thing called freaky aw sex on my brain it was the best thing.
i caught it when i was young and aunry just a baby havin nasty dreams,
i heard it was a zodiac thing they say scorpios are known to be freaks,
i see somthin looking good i say dwaam(dwaam) and when i see that ass hop i get gee(get gee).

now adayz im up up in adult clubs
(i can not shake it)

(i cannot fake it)
freaky viris who got me off of lust when
(thats when you bring us)

(that cunnalingus)

i still be watchin pornos eatin digornos
my hormones been running wild since the day i was borno

tossed ya funky donkey in the kitchen and my posta 
on the sink we breaking dishes micheal dougles and glen closa

do you really wanna get up in the bed with a pshyco sex fiend,
and if you dont wanna do it in the flesh we can do it in a wet dream

im gonna get up in ya brain no pain it'll be me and you (cha cha)
in a minute before i get in it, im gonna telk you boo what i really wanna do

Sparkers on me homie

Hundred sacks and nut sacks
Plus phat splats from flesh gats
Only hay waistin

Happy like I won the super trivecta divorce
Fuck whenever cause I'm HELLA HELLA
Lifted I'm HELLA HELLA
Chronic hella sonic

Not Atlantis but I'm here to remind you
That I'm on canibus ALCOVE

Unless I get some biancas to let me give 'em something
To open they MOUTH FOR

Lets get drunk, get blowed
Spit shit, spark blunts and fuck hoes

Bags ya bud when you go grecious gracias senior

On that one-fifty-one rum liquor
And plus that lime green sticky shit B's a kicker
It makes me wanna ROLE BUD, ROLE BUD
And fuck a bitch wit NO RUB, NO RUB

When it sikes ya hype ya pipe to lighter
Might ignite a snipe to swipe a viper
Only when you dippin is wet
But the only wet I'm dippin in is vagina if it don't smell like salmon
Crockets I'm in the zone passed gone
Be actress if ya comin bring ya silly ass on

They hate me cuz they hate but please make no mistake 
They know me but cant stop me cuz im paul wall the great

I wanna give, give it all
I said, I said, I said, I said
I wanna try to kill everything in my way
Everybody say, hey, ey, ey, ey, ey!

Yep, I'm the one ya heard
Reppin rojo on Jimmy Kimmel had some disturbed
But niggas know that we ruff and rugged so mums the word
Tech N9na face painted look like he come ta purge!
Real scorpio, shoot this thing like a Torpedo
Rock the rip, no remorse we go
Dummy like Mork from Ork, we know
And I say that with the utmost respect
I bust low to death, I must bode the check
It's never enough, no for Tech
So I get sick with it, I make a bitch dig it
Even when I wanna speed it up and I quick-spit it
I get a bit wicked up in a battle
Tryin to bite a buck, I blabber in his fitted
Killin' music get me spiff sitted, I can't piss when it become hard
So I need a chick to hit it when I kick a lyric
And I'm a murder 'til I'm on the yard (Murder)
My verbs are like birds that jerk up and merk the weak twerps
You can't hurt the durka
First to, insert the work inside of the earth
I disperse the curse to reverse ya to the worst of ya venomous
Squirt ya mercer (Ugh)
Trip not, you see I got the advantage in hip hop
Cause rappers sound identical so when N9na's shit drop
I do numbers, I'm the pinnacle so never will it stop
Y'all can't beat me doin' nothing, except for
Stalkin' these thoughts I spew and suckin'
We run this independent game, it ain't no screwin' us
When we runnin' everything except our mouth while they blue and sufferin'
This on the Bible, I kill any life with a script from this rhyme
Music's done divine, this is my rifle
There aren't any like it cause this one is N9ne, is a gift from his mind

Yo, I Got the call from Tech N9ne
He needed assistance from the group with the best rhymes
That spit the heat up off of yo ass and grind
Fuck all of them flex rhymes
I get love in every city I sack in cause I rep mine
Around the world, the girls give me head on tour cause I headline
I gotta get fed, I'm fed up, my homies is doin' fair time
I look at that clock and all I see is "Go get that bread" time
Lost too many soldiers so tears, I gotta shed mine
Turn on the radio, hear yo shit, and oh, it's bedtime
I fall asleep, it all is weak, most y'all shouldn't be called MCs
Bro, ya discography, you ain't sale cause all of ya talk is cheap
Smoke up all the tree, my whip look like it got a fog machine
My crib look like a pharmacy, that's prolly why you wanna haul my team

Livin' facetious, what the hell, why the weed lit
I make change where I see fit
I don't play like I don't see shit
Yeah, one hunnit, one hunnit, keep it that way and it's a poem
And stay away from the hate and keep all yo plays right in motion
Bust it, I'm down after the sun and up before it, better know it
MVP, most valuable poet, been the coldest, kept it focused
Cause you miss every goal you don't shoot for
And every time you cut a corner, you make two more
The rich is in my life, so I don't have to have the things
And listen for the whispers so I don't have to hear the screams
And I go hard for what I want, so it's just colors when I dream
And then you realize, it's not as scary as it seems
Molly's for pussies

Ain't nobody handle me, heated like a candle be
Kissin' dirt, ya man'll be for tryin' to dismantle me
Music is my weapon, true, loud enough to deafen you
Never trip with Tech and crew, be careful who you steppin' to
I remember when I was young and I got scars through
Right in back of the paddy-wagons and cop cars too
Now that I'm flyin' high from a rockstar view
Security level let Allahu Akbar through---

I hate you
Can't stand you
Despise you
Detest you

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

I can't stand yo persona, the drama, yo marijuana, or yo momma
I really despise yo am a so comma I disapo who you honor
I see what you people can offer, I wonder what mommy taught ya
If it was up to me the G, I wanna sought ya, caught ya and then offed ya

I hate what you become, hate you have your freedom
Hate watchin' your reruns, hate givin' you refunds
I call 'em, how I see 'em, when I see scum, I free from the legions
Cerebrum, I see none, see your just really dumb

Hate seein' your whores, hate cleanin' your floors
Hate doin' your chores, won't be in your awards
Funk bein' your whore, hunks bein' of course, you punks being endorsed Chumps being assured, dumped being divorced

To test you like a sickness, I bet you'd like to lick this
 From Texas right to Memphis, built with ex dykes and glimpses
Of everything I hate, it would be great for you to skate off in a lake
A beautiful fate, I hope nobody is at yo wake

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

We're livin' in the cold age, road rage
Dark no sole, no way
Jose Cuearvo, there goes yo day
Every scare, everywhere, knows bogay

This life is too soft, haters more true talk
I hate the way that you cough, hate you when you blew off
You coofa, your crueler, so cool off
If we were arm and arm in handcuffs my arm I would rather chew off

So many reasons why I can't stand you
The man who's scam is to ban you
Cram you in the can under land in Grand View
Damn you if you stand near my farm, I slam you
Sammain', champaign your family and you

I'm a monster when it comes to you, conquer every one of you
Trade tours, paid for, your neighbor
'Cause they whores, pray for, decor
'Cause your state will create race wars

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

I hate you when you destroy buildings and kill millions of children
From black white Chinese Sicilian, I thrill
When you feel sin, dealin' drugs to billions
Awaiting your death, miserable until then

I wanna put my Rebox and get on top of his esophagus
And watch the Appocolypse drop him in Necropolis
Never was menogamus, doggin' is, you're botherin' all of us
Gotta get loose from those to ex to soddomus

I hate what you stand for, hate all your scandals
When your life's baned for, I will not burn a candle
The way you live is not easy to handle
You vandals toss 666 in your blood sample

Yo, the world is very different now, no more hugs
Just shrugs and crips and bloods and drugs
Not see show no love, never we be equal
My name is The Grinch, this song is dedicated to the evil people

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes
Your infection crowds my daily
So this can't be paradise

When you walk don't come my way
And don't dare honk at me when you drive
I'm The Grinch, I smell your stinch
And it is you I so despise

Look away from me when you see me
Never look into my eyes

[Intro]
They said I was a narcissist haha. The narcissistest. Trick! Yeah! Strange Music baby!

[Hook]
(He's a mental giant)
That's what they say
(He's a mental giant)
To those who nay-say
Hey, hey

[Verse 1]
Hey! I'm lookin' down on you niggas
Even though I'm 5'8″ & 195 pound on you niggas
So tall I can't even hear any of the sound you deliver
Me and my partners never see any of the hateful frowning you give us
Cause we splat little bitty braggin' wack rappers
You happen to be the bastard that got mashed up
Adapt to the simple fact here's a strap at ya, blast at ya
That's after the gap when I put the cash in my last chapter, that's laughter
Had passed a vast money bag, imagine a black Dracula
Smashin' 'em with the gas, upper class stature
It went to my head as my first time
To be cocky, I'm just a giant when I burst rhyme
My leg is humongous, is ya'll's verse mine?
Step on the mic, I can't stop my leg like Robert Klein
Giant robot make you feel very low shaint
I am so hot, in my skills there be propane
Why I'm gon' squash them and kill every poor thang?
Cause I'm a huge... Pillsbury dough mane

[Hook]
(He's a mental giant)
Tech N9ne!

Tech N9ne!
Yeah Tech N9ne!

To those who nay-say
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Narcissistic, hard to grip it
Dark and wicked, art's prolific
Mars with the stars, this is far lifted
Lyrics, quit the Bawitdaba, scriptures are terrific
Get a spitter with a bit of bitter marketed
With scrilla then a fifth of Henny liquor, start to twist it
Critters sit and shiver in the slit of zillas
Pit of killers, gritters hit a click of silly niggas are fictitious
On top of the game, I'm dropping the rain, Godly gifted
Hop in your lane and stopping your fame, bark is vicious
You got bars to witness, ya'll submissive
When I get your brain your thoughts is shifted
I'm incredible, highly technical meant for triumph, raw intricate
I need medical then more science, scars and stitches
Alphabetical gems blow by him, pause it a bit
Tech N9ne a mental giant!

[Hook]
(He's a mental giant)
Tech N9ne!
(He's a mental giant)
Tech N9ne!
Yeah! Tech N9ne!
(He's a mental giant)
That's what they say
(He's a mental giant)
To those who nay-say
Hey, hey

[Verse 3]
Mentally I'm like Shaq on stilts
Strange Music Inc. is white and black on built
For keeping rap on tilt
Like drinking Patron and Jack prone then yack on silk quilts
Got a fat dome that'll last long if that's where I'm skilled
Giant, huge, humongous, gigantic, expanded
Been floating for years and I ain't landed
Haters can't stand it the way that my noggin is big as Kansas
But the women that listen wanna know if I'm talking 'bout my damn dick

[Hook]
(He's a mental giant)
Tech N9ne!
(He's a mental giant)
Tech N9ne!
ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Tech N9ne!
(He's a mental giant)
That's what they say
(He's a mental giant)
To those who nay-say
Hey, hey
Y'all are not!

Yadda, they think my head big... Ask her if my head big. Haha, yadda! Yeah, Tech N9ne!---Lyrics submitted by alex juggalo.

[Intro - Tech N9ne]
We been doing this for a long long time now...
this music thing... and touring, y'know...
and still... I ain't met one person that could maintain righteousness
Know what I'm sayin?

[Verse 1 - Tech N9ne]
A wise man told me evil was lurkin and if you found it
try your best to not put yourself around it
Cuz when you in it you tend to push it to the limit but
then when the sin beginnin you wish you would stay grounded
I went all over the world and I done been through it
at the beginning I knew I wouldn't give in to it
but temptation over the sensation
women I'm embracin, so many of them waitin
Contemplatin how to get fornication
at yo door when its late with the motivation of Satan
so they say, but things go they way
but its more then pay told her hey yo the phase for today
But lust it sets in, and crush your chest in
for dust your destined, if drugs are let in
Enough to nest in, probably make you punch your best friend
and next kin cuz you let s-e-x win
You mean to tell me you can fight this land
with brightness and walk the path of the righteous man?
Yo, I want to believe that, itching to see that
if a positive person can shake the negative feedback
that this life has to offer what its faster
What a disaster if you didn't obey the master
Cuz that's mutiny, it would be new to me
if you was on tour with Tecca Nina and still you could be

[Chorus - Krizz Kaliko (Strange Lane Choir)]
(Holy, holy) If you lived in another world would you
(Know me, know me) I know you be strong, but you been gone a
(While) I know you still my
(Child) So I'm pullin for you
(Don't you owe me) Your soul and if you know it wont
(Show me, show me) You can see me if you look above the
(Clouds) You're Holier than
(Thou) So I say it for you

[Verse 2 - Krizz Kaliko]
How can I move the crowd without losin out of my faith?
Lucifer out of the way (way)
Or maybe he don't even exist
I ain't gotta trip off
Gettin hookers out of my system (get you out of my system)
See thats how he tricks em
Get em' sippin, then a big ol mickey he slips them (I wonder why)
Music soothes the savage soul
People could lose or win, but lack control
Wish we could choose to live and fast the soul
We smashin women then bypass the soul
They believin everything we breathe in
Half of us is Jesus, the other half is heathen
And how we get that bad half out?
We pray the lord would cast that out
Hope you got blessins let them pass that out
When we travellin and pass that route
Keep us under their grace is the place where we had that doubt
Where I stand, its pointin at me, but its with my hand
I need you, you holier than I am, I am

[Chorus - Krizz Kaliko (Strange Lane Choir)]
(Holy, holy) If you lived in another world would you
(Know me, know me) I know you be strong, but you been gone a
(While) I know you still my
(Child) So I'm pullin for you
(Don't you owe me) Your soul and if you know it wont
(Show me, show me) You can see me if you look above the
(Clouds) You're Holier than
(Thou) So I say it for you

[Verse 3 - Tech N9ne]
This verse was intended for a gospel rapper that we all admire
and he goes by the name of Da T.R.U.T.H.
All we wanted was a righteous man to lead us in the right direction
and maybe if he came we could change and regroup
So we laid it down and sent it hopin' we would rap wit us, track splittas,
Waited, and none of his people got back wit us
We kept callin' and they finally answered, when a month passed
We was prepared to do whatever, give it if he wants cash
but the lady who represent em would never send 'em a message from a secular messenger
Never be no nepotism, we supposed to be brothers, on the road to teach others
but the flow would be covered, don't wanna mess with Tech they know that we smothered
anybody who diss us, retire they weak flow
Cuz this is the pinnacle, nobody flyer than me, bro
If you didn't like it then I admire the ego,
And if they never told ya, then you better fire ya people
Cause fallen angels came for your help and then she pushed 'em
but Christians be the first to run they mouth about Muslims
but they always helpin in the hood, but y'all closed me out
y'all didn't even really wanna know what we bout
And we bombay, trippin on this on the don spay
and I had to spit on in cuz I couldn't afford Kanye
I needed help, your people showed me the wall
be lowly as y'all, I guess y'all wasn't holy at all... naw!

Much love to the gospel MC
J Blast for coming down in the midst of sinners to try to help us remedy our situation...
Even though most if his peers told him not to
cuz we secular MCs.
Thanks for giving me Da T.R.U.T.H. CD and bringing true Godliness to our circle bro...
God bless you, for being so...

[Chorus - Krizz Kaliko (Strange Lane Choir)]
(Holy, holy) If you live in another world would you
(Know me, know me) I know you be strong, but you been gone a
(While) WHILE, I know you still my
(Child) CHILD, So I'm pullin for you
(Don't you owe me) Your soul and if you know it wont
(Show me, show me) You can see me if you look above the
(Clouds) CLOUD You're holier than
(Thou) THOU So I say it for you
(Holy, holy) If you lived in another world would you
(Know me, know me) Would you know me?
(While) WHILE, WHILE
(Child) You my child now
(Don't you owe me) Your soul and if you know it wont
(Show me, show me) You can see me if you look above the
(Clouds) You're holier than
(Thou) oooooooh... yeeeeaaaah---Lyrics submitted by mitch.

(Hello?)
I want to par-ty (Huh?)
You want to par-ty (Yeah?)
We need to par-ty (Cool)
Let's have a par-ty (Lemme get up)

Saturday mornin', I ain't gotta work
Last night's show sold a lot of merch
Bad bitch in my bed so I ain't gotta jerk
Forbes List caught me so it's hard to make the dollar hurt
All we need is good green and some Bou Lou
Five to one so its guaranteed you can do you
'Zilla keep the heater just in case we have a boo-boo
Kansas City natives and we all a little coo-coo

This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy
On the interstate doin' 180
She said, "do it for me, baby"
Took a double shot and then we all went crazy
White girls go crazy
Black girls go crazy
College girls go crazy
This the type of shit to make the hood go crazy

So much liquor, I never spare that kitchen
Keep it so I usually have a pair that's kissin'
And I'm lifted on purple hair, that's bitchin'
Now that's what I call a fuckin' air Technician
Down there, they got the hair that's missin'
Keep it bare, I promise I'll never tear that kitten
I am aware sex hittin' is the care when I share that stick and
So good I might impair that vision
So I dip in, then dip off
Look for another chick, then they pissed off
Till I give them another spliff then they lift off
Party is the mission, I did cross
Three thick friends, we mixin' these licks when
They big friend wanna lip off
So I told her come and get lost, bitch
This my place and it's way too turnt up to trip off shit

Yeah, you my prototype
My fourth foreign car was a Porsche photo white
Cooler than a polar bear in a bowl of ice
With a ring, married to the game, had 'em throwin' rice
Wait a minute, put my thing in her
I'm trynna knock up, I'm trynna put a singer in her
So I can do a banger with her
I get brain for dinner
I don't need to put tender for contender
Thank god for strippers
High top with zippers, hard as some nipples
All the shit I do is straight off the temple
Trynna squeeze it into my schedule is like a pimple
Tell that poodle, "don't mess around with them pitbulls."

This the endin' from the N9ne
Grindin' bitches from behind
If you way drunk off the 'yac
Spit it up, spit it up, spit it up
This Kansas City, shit's ran gritty
In the summer time, the chicks be damn pretty
Born in the projects, then to the Ville
Then I did a deal with Travis and made mills
This is celebration, this is elevation
Me and my delegation got niggas hella hatin'
This is Nnutthowze, Regime, Rogue Dog
And it's all Strange Music, winners can't lose it, unless
Errbody got they hands up like (Oooh!)
See a bad bitch like (Wooah!)
This whole damn city fuckin' go
But this is how the hood go crazy in the MO---

Damn, my brand new Benz.
Thinkin of my so-called friends.
Why should I make amends ,when they crossed the nina and Sin again and again and again.
I love them dearly but hear me they burn severely I'm weary to the point that I really don't want not one one of them none of them near me.
Did, trust you, but what's new for real? Yeah I love you, but fuck you for real.

[Chorus: x2]
I love you but fuck you [x3]
Kinda strange how you came at me.
I love you but fuck you [x3]
Things will never be the same with me.

Met you at a rock show, November No. Octo,
Took pictures then locked yo, numbers and then got low,
Called you up a lot though, found out that you not a hoe.
Several trips to my show, shot me with your crossbow.
We used to kick it at pats-whites-and blacks, triple stacks and fat sacks we matched we relaxed, the kiss, but I never twist her she wish, for the better mister I mixed the lady with my kid but then miss she became my sister for a minute.
But then my lady started receiving that snitch, by that nigga on tour you wanna be the reason that split, you started believing that bitch in San Jose, you grip to what the damn ho say, you flip like a maam who stayed, no trips, never send your pay. We dipped.
Used to play for you, even used to pray for you. Never that cause you wanted to spit in my face and that was up up up and away for you. I hate this, I was real so why fake shit? You lost us so go fuck them bitches on myspaces.

[Chorus: x2]
I love you but fuck you [x3]
Kinda strange how you came at me.
I love you but fuck you [x3]
Things will never be the same with me.

Everyshow was a different face, but these two were from a different place,
Follow my tour gotta quick-embrace, never would've thought I'd have to give them space.
Father and daughter, loved me to death, Never cared their blood be the sin,
Just lovin the tech. Shrugged the regret. Then found out papa couldn't have the husband effect.
Everybody seened it but didn't believe, everybody got it but never did I receive it.
His dream was for me to fuck miss thing. But she looked 15, baby girl was 19.
But Instead of givin the dick I'd rather give her ice cream. Now I'm trippin, cause her pop's just tryin to auction her off,
But it turns out he was knockin her off. I had to stop and I coughed, cause that, baby, turned out to be the boyfriend. Guess he was givin him a little bit extra when he brought the toys in.
Ya'll lied to me did it fuck with the Nina, sho it did.
Ya'll made me question what your motive is.
Don't cry Ali but my temper is flared and scared off,
So to see you I guess I'll see you in the crowd like where's waldo.

[Chorus: x2]
I love you but fuck you [x3]
Kinda strange how you came at me.
I love you but fuck you [x3]
Things will never be the same with me.

I wrote this carefully...
I love you cause you married me, when I needed therapy,
Let me move in with you be my wife you wasn't scared of me,
But fuck you because you say, if you don't get a job today,
Better kick rock wasn't hard to say, when you knew I'd rap my heart away.
I love you cause you sexy, love you cause you're beautiful.
Love you cause way back in the day you thought that I was suitable,
But fuck you treated me, stupid and conceitedly,
I wasn't very smart but a genius you wanted me to be.
I love you cause you strong, I love you cause you real.
Because you forgave me when I cheated and poppin pills,
But fuck you for bringin up, shit that happened years ago.
Chances of us getting back is gunna take a miracle.
You live in the past, I'm givin the gas and cash,
How many niggas did that without you givin the ass?
And I ask you what other nigga, would step up with the love to give her,
G's in the house for you and the kids and even for your other nigga.
Enjoy the dough you get, cause I don't owe you shit.
You was unhappy with me so you split.
You need to show me some love ma, and I don't mean that I wanna fuck you.
Just acknowledge me taking care of you because Ill... Ill...

[Chorus: x2]
I love you but fuck you [x3]
Kinda strange how you came at me.
I love you but fuck you [x3]
Things will never be the same with me.---Lyrics submitted by Nicole.

If you see me lookin' clean cut
Matchin' from head to toe dippin' with a mean strut
Throwin' and blowin' green stuff hella creamed up with a bling cup
Ain't no wicked we can kick it if you blue or beamed up

If you, see me step off in the clubber with some pros
With about 6 of 'em cut no longer waiting to be chose
And if you hear me tell my homies anything goes 
With these chickens dippin' to Davy's right when the clubber close

If you see me on the grind getting' mine
If you bust in the room and find me hittin' yours from behind
If you hear me bustin' rhymes rippin' each and every time
If I got it at capacity and you still got a line

If I'm rollin' on dubs, if it's K-Town bud
If they showin' me love with a red rug at the club
If you see them hatas giving me mugs, ladies giving me hugs
It ain't no rocket science it's because

I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
Oh oh I'm a playa
[Repeat 2x]

I'm a playa in every sense of the word ya heard
I'm getting' money from these dummies flip your chick so absurd
I'm a playa and I pop collars
I'm a playa when I don't or when I do drop dollars them rot weilders

She don't want no softy sayin' he do when he don't
She don't want no perpetrating 9 to fiver trying to flaunt
She don't want no punk that can't get it krunk
No she don't that's how it go so my homie Kaliko tell'em what she want

She want a playa not thugs on dubs
We be rollin' them 22's and 3's pop ludes and V's
I'm in hot pursuit of a prostitute Kaliko knock boots gots lots to shoot

Im pullin out the latex and given it to who's next
And fool'em pull a brewnet wit unforgettable sex
She's oohin-oohin' sweat and I ain't telling who's wet
And I ain't getting loose yet so who's next 4 group sex

I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
Oh oh I'm a playa
[Repeat 2x]

Listen closely this is something you might not know
Never ever tell ya love where else you get your love
Move in groups no one on one when you hit the club
And you should know this if you call yourself a wicked thug
If you creep to the movies throw away your ticket stub

If you sexin' learn this lesson when you wash off
Just use hot water don't put no soap on your wash cloth
That way when you get home no questions you won't leave her bent
Don't be a dope and use the soap cause it will leave a scent

Don't tell a #2 that she's your one and only
Cause if she know it's way easy to go her own way
If you taking chickens to your secret home hey
Always go the back way to confuse'em just take the long way

To all the ladies if you playin' throw ya hands up
To all my fellas if you playin' throw ya grands up
This is 4-eva baby having clever thangs I'm a playa
Mother fucker and I bet I'll never change


I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
I'm a playa
Oh oh I'm a playa

So comfortable at the top i hopped on a plane an

I rent my rooms on the moon Mr. Smith's comin soon 
The angels feedin my cereal with a silver spoon 
My hairline is Craig Smith airlines arrive from 
kansas city through L.A. as long as a fan line

my hip-hoppin gave them ga side swipe to mars

you want your scripts to fly not in my solar system 
cuz i dismiss them like they wish to die 
Maga then nature and i rip the why 
civilian ladies love me so bro excuse her while she kiss the sky 
call me masta more exaulted then a priest to paster 
blasphamy had me blast fags fast with maga

Threw her in the trunk
Was tryin to smash
Get her cash
But her mouth was hella fast
So I threw her ass (in the trunk)
And even though she had a big plump rump
I threw her in an let the beat bump (through her in the trunk)
[Repeat X2]

2K11 ridin so low
In the benz on the twins hella low pro
Slingin CDs out the trunk of modo
My mojo said "a thick bitch" so I go slow
I pull it over tryin to get up on her bumper
wantin to crunch her so I "baby my new CD is a slumper"
It'll make the trunk thunder
Girl your rump give me lumber
Up under the sheets I can put you in a real deep slumber
She said fuck Tecca Nina didn't feel her
Did everything within my power not to kill her
Disrespectful bitch I really wish that I can grill her
Light on my head said that said put her in the trunk man you can steal her
I put the hater bitch in a head lock
She flippin out
I pop the trunk she crunk but I'm ain't bout to chicken out
I'm sick and tired of bein nice and lettin shit go by
She said fuck that Tech N9ne bullshit so I

[Chorus]
Threw her in the trunk
Was tryin to smash
Get her cash
But her mouth was hella fast
So I threw her ass (in the trunk)
And even though she had a big plump rump
I threw her in an let the beat bump (through her in the trunk)
[Repeat X2]

I'm bumpin everything that beat like gangsta shap
I bangs the rap in her ear til she gives thanks to that
Never take a prisoner where you hang your hat
Imma roll around wit her in the trunk
Poppin that Tech N9ne slump til the little bitch faint collapse
Imma roll to Topeka
Tecca Nina'll reach her if I gotta double back to Eureka
Crispy flows through my tweetas
Bumpin this ring when I roll through a teeta
Wait a minute I think this bitch is trying to kick a hole through my speakas
Get my gun then I open the trunk and said

Get out the God damn trunk! (OK!)
Get on the God damn ground! Take off your God damn belt! Put it around your ankles! Imma tie up your wrists myself! (OK! OK!)
I just wanted some drank n shit! What wrong with you?
(spitting sound) Bitch! (Ahh!)
The hell wrong with you?!

(Hey)
The hot sex was not slam dunk
Rode for hours then I stop right off van brun
When a bitch talkin crazy like a lost mans chump
Shode say "I throw bitch in the God damn trunk!"

[Chorus]
Threw her in the trunk
Was tryin to smash
Get her cash
But her mouth was hella fast
So I threw her ass (in the trunk)
And even though she had a big plump rump
I threw her in an let the beat bump (through her in the trunk)
[Repeat X2]

Hours turn to days
Days turn to weeks
Had to drill holes in the trunk so she could drink n eat
Whatever I stuff through the holes
Hot dogs n hohos 
Kidnapped on a low low spoke no mo
Oh no go slow there the po-po
I gotta ditch this
Bitch with a quickness
Man I just remembered this Benz-o was lifted
From Swope Park that's where I'm about to go dart
Letter know art
For the evil bitch and the brainless witch with no heart
It got so dark

Police are still looking for 21-year old Crystal Nelson who has been missing since last Sunday.
Friends and family told police they thought this was yet another one of Crystal's weekend excursions.
But after all this time, they're still worried sick.

[Tech]
Its been fun mama
Fed her my catalog like adderall
Fucked up in the trunk with rump is how I had her ya'll
In a ditch
Walked back to the trunk
Wicked is how I sounded
Whispered "Bet that you love Tech N9ne now, bitch"
(Threw her in the trunk)

[Police]
Uh, I think I found the missing Mercedes here in Swope Park, uh, in a ditch near shelter 5.
Uh, it appears the car is still running. Um, music's playing.
Um, I'm approaching the car now, um, let me turn down the music.
Um, I'm gonna go ahead and pop the trunk.
There's an African-American female in the trunk.

Verse 1: Tech N9ne
I was chillin wit a bitch/
and i was noticing she was so sadistic/
Wanted the Nina to bite on her nipples and twist it/
Sucking me off until she lost all of her lipstick/
You know how it is when you X-ing on like 7 of em'/
Wit a stick of Sherm and Adderall, nigga had to love em'/
Cause they get you lifted and thinkin you unstoppable/
But what I'm bout to tell you is so fuckin' impossible/
I started giving the bitch my dick/
She loving the way my jimmy be jabbin it/
Wanted me to cut her up, I said never/
She said imagine it with the tip of her butcher knife/
I think i took her life/
This crazy hooker like pain, then i put her right/
Fuckin high, and it's insane how she look at life/
She wish a nigga had fangs and he took a bite/
I'm beating it up wit an aim what the pussy like/
The pussy like to be banged like it took a fight/
Then she asked me to smack her/
Then she asked me to choke her/
So i choked her/ As a nigga got closer to the nut I choked her/
Even harder as i when i rose up out the Chocha/
She wasn't breathing, A horrible evening/
Couldn't get her to breath, I really tried ta/
Did all i could of,

verse 2: (K-dean?)
Shit i was only 16, just showing off/
Never woulda imagined the gun going off/
I was just trying to show these niggaz that i wasn't soft/
Stayed at 52nd street so that's what all these niggaz thought/
Cause they was from hilltop, where niggaz pill pop/
So i'm pulling up to the chill spot/
Wit the steel cocked
still not sure what I was thinking
And back then I wasn't even drinking
So I'm leaving Lincoln High School off Woodland
Headed to the hood to hang out wit all the hoodlums
Couldn't wait to show him what I was packing
Knock on the door, he answered like "Whuuss Crackin"
I said "Shit, just chillin, just me and my bitch"
"By my bitch, I mean that 450 sittin on my hip"
"Wanna see"? He said "yeah let me see"
I pulled it out and gave it a quick squeeze
I didn't know it didn't have no safety
Now this man is hit in his chest and he can't breath
Devil on my shoulder whispering "Leave nigga, Leave"
But i swear...

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Wanna live in my world you have to have a Tech tat
Preferably the number N9ne and you gotta get it where the back of you neck's at
Gotta let me know that you rep that, plus get you out of a death trap
You need it for living cause I'm the king
And I'm giving you the permission to get with a no stress pack
That was ordos at chlorum acuse the old world orders
Post mortem disfailure inhaling cell and delta
Watched it swell and swelter till there was no male in shelter
Yes I'm the one that provided ya shell in Hell and held ya
When your politicians were welters
So I built this structure just to help ya
So the communists can come and quell ya
They call me the King of Darkness when I offer you no pain
Why would they label me heartless when your love is my cocaine
And your soul is my rogaine I have a thirst to know your brain
When you enter my domain gotta take this number for your name
But you don't have to drink cyanide I'm gonna be right by ya side
If we gotta take that riot ride on the enemy adn defy your side
Fight for the place we're building for the preroduction of more children
Trying to get that number back around 6 billion I'm gonna rule until then
Founded this colony like a pilgrim
Anybody try to penetrate this section or threaten we KILL THEM

[Hook x2: Mackenzie O'Guin]
What if?

What if, he is, what he says he is?

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Xes lliw eb yrotadnam yliad ylthgin
This, women need to be living by it
Stay fit n way driven paste it and dye it
I am the king killer captain crazed frigging pilot
Giving you these khaki pants and white shirt, that's what you wear on my Earth
Eliminating your eye thirst to have any kind of desires
To envy material or admire, my way will extract any type of divider
I'm offering this wider
Understanding of life and tiredly blissfully vading friction and fire, cha
The number N9ne will get you food, even get you tools
To build anything your family choose, but within my rules
All white shoes with red strings for all my crews
That let's me know you Tech's people listening inside my pews
All your dreams and aspirations
This is the affirmation
That you can reach 'em and my world is not a disaster waiting
The ruses and lacerations no chooses of aggravation
I'm just try'na rehab a nation from exasperation
It's not an exaggeration, I'm something more than your blood and gore
On a level higher than devils or that of Satan

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
What I did "Anghellic" I was good and bad, straight confused
Then an angel turned to Devil Boy when the Reperation blew
Them demons had "Absolute Power" when I drug abused
So the angels searched through the "Vintage Tech" what they found was the love was through
Then an accident would happen that made life necessary
So now receiving God, the angel was 'Everready'
But the Melancholy strikes, the eleven angels mommy's life
So the Mizery sat in the angels now becoming ice
As mom got I'll and iller, when it hurts her he can feel her
To the strain of the pain made of bane there's no more angels straight up KILLER!
My apologies, it's not very God of me
To go crazy and try to teach the whole world 'Sickology'
I was then split in two, back to the beginning view
Angel demon cause the killer showed me death was overdue
But I gotta live for my kids, all the eveil stuff I did
Taught me to teach you, you can love then no matter how much sluts you did
Or dug, you met my demon back when I had that grudge
But I gotta let you know most of my spirit comes from up above
I'm mostly angel, and you know sometimes we fall
Living under God and I hope he's listening when I say I love you all!---Lyrics submitted by mitch.

Cuz the Hennessey will melt a little ice and it might irk
Me when im all up on a tight skirt
I need a fully loaded Kansas City Tea for quenchin my thirst
If you aint got no Real lemon just let some of the lime juice spill in them
I know a lot of the Caucasian people don't really do the Hennessey
But the way that I make it I will Hen em
Convert a lot of people every year an
On St. Patties day I shared it with very weird fans
They started fightin and my leg was near rammed
I told em take it easy there's a beverage here man
KC Tea is One Hunit mayne
Check it if its flat sprite then I don't want it mayne
My money mayne is on Hennessey and the image of cream corn
I'm runnin thangs ( I'm runnin Thaaangs)

[Hook]
What you want want
What you need
What you havin
What will it be

All we need is Hennessey then a sprite,
squeeze it in it, twist a lemon,
this one is the best one in it

[Course]
HENESSEY (Twist some lemon with the)
HENESSEY (Sprite go right with the)
HENESSEY (Make ya night go right with the)
KC TEA (KC TEA!)
HENESSEY (Twist some lemon with the)
HENESSEY (Sprite go right with the)
HENESSEY (Make ya night go right with the)
KC TEA (KC TEA!)

[Verse 4]
A lot a men never sinned on the Hen
Where ya been boy boy where ya been?
It'll have ya wit her again and again
Even strong enough to do her lesbian friends
If you can't handle her then hand her to me
Cuz im at five of em and I'm bout to hammer the V
Even got it set up for the camera to see
I'm wit her but I'm really picturing Angela Ye
She aint wearin nothing but Pradas on her feet
KC Tea got me really supersonic in the sheets
Hittin harder than sticky icky chronic on the streets
So nice to wake up in the bathroom aint no vomit on the seat
Bartender made it right and I'm sure because it tastes sweet like canddy
Yeah, and Ludacris you can make it with Conjour
And 40 you can make it with Landy but Authentic is the
HENNESSEY (It's about 38 a Fifth)
HENNESSEY (In Canada is like 68)
HENNESSEY (But Wal-Mart got it for 20 BOY Yeah! let's go!)
KC TEAA (KC TEA!)

HENESSEY (Twist some lemon with the)
HENESSEY (Sprite go right with the)
HENESSEY (Make ya night go right with the)

[Intro]
I was born in november, 8th day 1971st y'all
9 oclock in the mornin, a christian girl in kansas city gave birth y'all
She taught the kid how to love and give all praises to our maker till the earth fall
Then mama married a muslim when I was 12 and that transition was the worst y'all
I converted to Islam but every once in awhile I read a bible verse y'all
How am I to refrain from eatin pork and havin christmas when I thirst all
All of this it was blended many religions plenty women got my shirt y'all
At home no longer attended when I was 17 I bounced like a nerf ball

[Verse]
Yeeeeah
Spit it big quick
My day, I slay, pie may, trick don't get a bitch hit (questionable)
I'm mastering it, I'm flyin around with equipment
Really big time and now I'm not fittin this bitch
I'm ridin around and I'm grittin it
To the people the people that want the evil I'm givin you, that and a couple others a KLUS-TER-FUK
Of a brother which you discover to KRUSH-MUCKS-UP
In the gutter cause I'm a thug and they TOUGH-JUST-STRUCK
On you MUUHFUCKAS I'll be the BLOOD BROTHA givin you LOVE FROM the SLUG if you BUG on a NIGGA
TUG on a trigger no HUGS I'm a kiss her with GRUNGES and PLUG her with DRUGS when I give her
DICK
Fatherly, when I spit on these kiddies don't bother me
In the brown and red dickies, Mahogany
Red all over me like I hit an artery
Fuck all of these, hypocrites, lick a dick, Just swallow me
If you follow me and wanted to abolish me
When I'm honestly, a straight oddity
I'm just twisted, non-fictitious, on this wicked, shit spit it big quick
Ready whenever machete will sever the head or be dead up in the lake or in the metal and big thick bricks
Pucker up, suck this nutter butter gutter slut
If you wonder what is uttered this is KLUSTERFUK
Ever seen a nigga with hella followers and they love a nigga so much he be wantin to tell them to kill
HA HA HA HA HAAAA, and they will
So ya better watch that, no this ain't a shock tactic got that bit down to the grill
Heheheheheheheeeeh, WAY REAL
I got the shit that get the crowd jumpin
My shit a lotta thumpin silly just like a DRUNKEN MONKEY
Nigga we PUNKIN FLUNKIES
Killa we KRUNK N FUNKY
Uhh... PUMPING CHUNKY
Uhh... BOOTY BITCHES IN THE BUNK WITH A DONKEY EH!

[Bridge]
Crazy, I might be way in my psyche laid as a bright p.a
Playin, they wanna fight me, they don't really like me, they gonna not replay
Yeah I'm good and a little bit of evil
Inside of me, they about equal
Call it a bust, when I'm all in a rut
I'm a Klusterfuk, nigga y'all are just
FECAL
Growin up low enough, musta sucked
PEOPLE
Call me what? call me a Klusterfuk
FECAL
Growin up low enough, musta sucked
PEOPLE
Call me what? call me a Klusterfuk

[Interlude]
Talk about growin up fucked up, I grew up with a mentally I'll mother, so it's no wonder that I'm slightly askew
Her fanatical religious views had me sittin in pews 8 days a week, and because of that me and God didn't speak for a while
Now I crack a smile when asked my religious preference
I utter a Tech N9ne reference replyin, I'm a KLUSTERFUK
I mixed up all the stuff religion that had to offer, boiled it in my cauldron till the bullshit burned off it
All that was left was love, I can't say I always rise above the trivial shit in my life cause I don't
Sometimes my ego won't allow me to walk away, if you know what I'm sayin
I've done a lot of drugs, shit, I've done a lot of thugs, but in the end
As long as I'm aligned with love, I KNOW I'm livin righteous

[Outro]
By a landslide my energy
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically
Love it when the fans buy my memories
By a landslide my energy
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically
Love it when the fans buy my memories
By a landslide my energy, (Growin up low enough, musta sucked)
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically, (Call me what? call me a Klusterfuk)
Love it when the fans buy my memories
By a landslide my energy, (Growin up low enough, musta sucked)
Will kill a man why try mimic me
Cause the fans tied identically, (Call me what? call me a Klusterfuk)
Love it when the fans buy my memories ---

Lacrimosa
Tis is all so serious
Come, Holy Spirit
Stay with me always
Somehow my true love
The tears on my face

Now-now-now-now people cussing and bussing
They get nothing but in the ground when they blown out
Oh wow, tell me how he got the stubborn, he tough and
He was young with a grown mouth
Zoned out cause my mother is gone, how
Simply would he send me with the alone route
Going out, to the studio hitting the Don Julio
My duty go if I'm moody yo, get up and get the song out
My angel fades, then came more rage
And even though Strange still pays, something inside of me saying it ain't yo days
My religion, walking away
My prediction, lost in the gray
I'm thinkin' the holy spirit don't really wanna hear it
So people who givin' me evil, they all finna pay
Anybody really want it, I'm a get dirty when a demon is my opponent
Feeling froggy any moment, know you will never be the owner because I'm on it
Losing mama, really did it, demons really gonna get it
I'm looking for the light, I'm asking you open and losing all of my inner good and the hope with it

Lacrimosa (Inside I'm weeping)
Tis is all so serious (Constantly seeking)
Come Holy Spirit
Stay with me always
Somehow my true love
The tears on my face

I don't wanna hear no punk say 'Weirdo'
If you ain't in my circle, then you're not even near, bro
Here go the fear though, getting Makzilla and my killas in the villa to make a racket in your ear go
(Blam-blam-blam-blam)
That is severe mode, bodies I'm not even with the jolly
My tears go down-my-face, yeah
But I'm switching the gears, yo
Got on the plane to Colorado, I go to hit the Summer Jam, then momma tomorrow
Thinking the Lord will give me time while I'm in 'Vado
To say I love her before the Bible go hollow
(Gone-gone-gone-gone)
My show was sorrow, needed a little bit of mo' time to borrow
(My-time's- up)
Man, steady talking to God, so I don't - get it
Thought I was special enough for God to be with it
By giving me another day with my mother, but I missed it
But rocking with Denver said in her name, I'm a rip this
(Done-done-done-done)
This ain't no way to be, hella jaded, see, but I'm created
My mother left me, but her death ain't okay with me
Still I'm praying for her spirit to stay with me

Lacrimosa (Outside I'm weeping)
Tis is all so serious (Still I am seeking)
Come, Holy Spirit
Stay with me always

When you interview me, I don't wanna talk about this
I don't denounce God in any way
I just feel my mother's suffering was too great for how much she worshipped---

Where i'm at right now, I ain't got no tolerance for somethin stupid, or hatred, or envy. 
If you bringin any one of those, How bout, Leave me alone. 

They pray i'll free fall any day, Well I don't need yall anyway. 
Negativity give me nay ya finna hear me say. 
Just leave me right here with my henny-say my chicks an plenty pay. 
Your boy Tech done blown, an still rep the home, but now I just wanna be left alone. 
They wish death and my flesh and my chromosomes slept my songs, they need a little bit less Patron. 
And they holler the weirdo, when i walk in the spot, 
The zeros pissed cuz they ladies wanna swaller my hero. 
They live in squaller and fear though they daughter come here though, she know I keep plenty Robert De Niro. You punks will never get to see me let a tear go. 
Started hatin the second I busted a mere flow. I just want you to get some gones, not near no. 
Negative energy that is a remedy, hey yo listen here bro: 

(Chorus) 
Stay away from me 
Please stay far away from me 
Leave me by my lonely 
Just let me be 
Stay away from me 
Please stay far away from me 
Leave me by my lonely 
Just leave me alone 

(Verse 2) 
The hood don't play me huh, Treat my strange music like rabies huh 
They be sayin tech nina he crazy huh. 
But you want me on your video 
and cd. 
You elementary rappers are straight remedial, A.D.D. 
I'm in my own world partna, and you don't fit there. 
All your tech hatred has got you soundin like a bitch player. 
And this is to multiple haters and I swear it, ain't about a pass but if the shoe fit wear it nigga. 
Its a size N9ne, wanna step inside mine? 
It'll feel like you died tryin, and you will know that I can't buy time, for you to catch casper its high time. 
You tried crimes against me cause you couldn't follow the guidelines. 
They say respect your elders, you best go tell the lord forgive you cause whats next yo failure. 
Just leave me where its less your hell bruh. 
Invest your mail to somethin that sell cause the Tech don't smell ya, Tech gon tell ya: 

(Chorus) 
Stay away from me 
Please stay far away from me 
Leave me by my lonely 
Just let me be 
Stay away from me 
Please stay far away from me 
Leave me by my lonely 
Just leave me alone 

(Verse 3) 
We be singular, numero uno ichibon. 
They want my doom and my funeral, psycho bitch be gone. 
Losin my lithium quickly this chick done hit me don, and bit me on my finger, tell Trav to get me bond. 
Cause if it happens again, if it happens again, imma psssstst BOY! 
I wish I had no problem with smackin a friend with a gat be snappin a chin. 
But i got chicks that wanna get it in, for sure. 
I'm takin all the crazy ho's outta my lady mode, i'm done with the oldies, nothin but new shit in my radio. 
Leave me solitary cause the way she go is shady though. 
It's later for there he go, no more Tech N9ne let the baby know. 
All of ya need to try clit, and straight deny dick. 
Leave us alone cause you mentally damaged, no try sick. 
I wish I wasn't a star and the gentleman would die quick. 
So next time you trippin, 
i'll flip and hit you in your eye bitch. 

(Chorus) 
Stay away from me 
Please stay far away from me 
Leave me by my lonely 
Just let me be 
Stay away from me 
Please stay far away from me 
Leave me by my lonely 
Just leave me alone---Lyrics submitted by Anthony.

I won't look back anymore, after this
Pitch black, star bright, yeah that's my life
A bit of fire and ice
Watch friends, plot foes, stock ends and pot holes
Cause when the tank hit the bank, it just got closed
Don't be stank in the paint cause the yak froze

Wish I knew back when I was strugglin'
If I plugged in and kept bustin'
I'd be buzzin', that'd make me super rich
Never knew my sufferin' over but
Cousin, I keep it up and gushin'
And tell all of my family, aunts and uncles, cousins to do the shit
Just gain power through all of the rain showers
No different, remain sour cause someone else's lame hours
Wish I woulda known to tell 'em all to start they own business
Make long digits instead of havin' a boss who talk at the wrong pitches
To fake friends, cause it's never enough
At hostile situations with folks, I learned it's better to bust
First, and you still a nigga no matter how much ya stuff's worth
You love who love you, do hug who does true
Connect the true blood to 'cause blue
So keep hopin' the Lord does show up
Cause it'll never be no peace on earth for all of us
Till this mug blow up

Locked up, I'm free still doing time
I'm stuck, on notes of some of mine
Incarcerated, Sometimes I hate it
This is the sentence of my life

Ponderin' these thoughts while sittin' idle in this mezzanine
Feel my feelin's boilin' up, I'm simmerin' on everything
Goin' for the gold because it's shimmerin', but everything
That you encounter seems to be devoured, need a better team
Every thought and every dream, every plot and every scheme
Lurkin' around the corner is a hater waiting like a fiend
And choice of drug is negative, and they use it like a sedative
Success becomes the cause of this effect, abuse the medicine
You thinkin' you can let 'em in, partake in buildin' excellence
The serpents come in twos and they meticulous with they meddlin'
The feathers flock together, see the relationships we settle in
Got consequences so it's best to let 'em go, we blessed again
Disloyalty unfoiled, trynna justify they pestilence
I don't understand why they so [?] manic pessimists
I guess if I had to guess, I'd make an estimate, I guess that they
Was just afraid so watch us levitate 'til I'm at heaven's gate

Mmm, Life sentence for fallin' out ya physical body
Illuminate my soul, officially became godly
I be the one, all of these demons runnin' from
Dumped a gun, lifted spirits, niggas deem me the chosen one
Phony family in my crowd, rappin' gap and loud
Facin' twelve in the pin, none of them niggas made a sound
None of them niggas round
Now the fame close and the name boasts
I'm 'posed to break bread? Bitch, taste toast
I should smoke them ungrateful bitches
They doin' the most to see what make you choke
It actually leave ya throat missin'
I'm on a mission to revisit kin and
My prime been hidden, trynna dine with women
Dipped and find this linen, try and find a business
I love who love Gee, fuck you if it's fuck me
That's just how it gotta be, cause I'm paper routin'
Tame nuisance, insane view and check on my lawn
Strange recruit me, guess when the God speakin' strange music

Instead of cry, maybe I'll keep it inside---

(verse 1)

Hope somebody lets me in

If you hear this please send help.

                  CHORUS X2
Cuz its raining in my head
Another storm another day
These little pills will change my mind
Cuz they dont make it go away
(keeps on rainin)
its over X17

Can only see myself is anybody here
(i aint even myself no more)
If you could be myself youd understand me clear
(cant pick myself up off the floor)
And if i died today itd take my pain away
Cuz it flooded (flooded)
and im drownin (drownin)
Well its liberating me

                   CHORUS X2

Lets find a way to run away from life,
Full of pain and strife
What direction im goin i cant tell now,
Mr. 7-20 Nina tell me im Hell bound
The IRS is on my ass for the check i didnt cash and the levy from child support, felt like i fell down.
So im lookin for exctacy pills, tech is the next to be thrilled, seconds from method we ill daily.
My brains cookin, the recipe will beckon, the best of me killed, sections of steppin, i feel crazy.
Hit the club in the night, with a lil bit of drug in my life, i miss your lovin real hyphy, im deliverin.
With my seat out my sight, seperated from my wife in the middle of a crisis in hives shakin and shiverin.
Rollin balls, im mulated im going dumb, now drinkin liquor, im faded and havin fun now.
Loaded gun and im trippin wit everyone around, keep me stuck in the sky, i never wana come down.

WHEN WE COME TO THE STREET WE DON POST ON THE BLOCK
For the killa I'ma lift my middle finger up to the cop
So On the way to the studio we be makin another hot track
They be lovin the way we spit it
Boy they want our position but they ain't never get it
In the hone of the pacific
We the definiton of a soldier
My opposition is the cultural
I spit like a tomic
Me and my killa are guerillas

Boy we tryin to battle cuz they want our position
But they ain't never get it
Man I told you
We the number one competitors dealin
Working the way to the top and get the millin
In the hone of the city you can never cross us

Try to get your speed up but it ain't gon matter
Cause after were done bustin a nigga we don after

[CHORUS]

Whenever I'm reppin the city in the cane
Holla your brain cuz I'm a disaster

And we flow like with the mo like

Hands down now I popped ya now
Lets take a trip to the back of your real gear
Strange the individual wit ill skill

Diggy diggy down diggy down watcha diggy down
Cook it clown and at the house hold it down diggy diggy__ diggy down
And if you look for the sound you can be found
With the nigga in the crowd are you really wit me?
And when you hear it then nigga then zip it
These make you want to reposition and pivit
When we write it and spit it we makin somebody get it
And if they wont hear it then they wont get it, STOP

Or rapplin off at the mouth while we travelin
And we speakin on on the speakin on the things we be doin comin in to pop my mouth

[Intro]I
 We scoured the globe on a quest to find the most elite
 Most intricate tongues of all time
 California, New York, Denmark, Australia
 Then a cold wind from the Midwest brought the hardest
 Fastest, most accurate tongues ever heard in our lifetime
 These are the Midwest Choppers

[K-Dean]
 I got a message for any one of you muthafuckin niggaz
 That wanna talk 'bout the Mid-Midwest
 We dangerous, Aim to bust any little nigga with a big-big chest
 Anybody that wanna be comin thinkin they hotter
 I'm a type of nigga that'll really kill ya for dollas
 Fuck everybody that want a piece of a killa
 For real, Me and my niggaz will leave you floatin in a river
 So fuck all you haters, You heard what I said
 My flow a little bit over your head
 Act like a pencil, I'll fill you with led
 If you afraid, Then tell me you scared
 Cause imma little bit out of my muthafuckin mind
 The hardest rapper that Tecca N9na could fuckin find
 Who that? Who that? That's me
 Who that? Who that? K-Dean
 When I was comin up in the game everybody was tellin me
 "I really be killin a lot of you niggaz, I'm mean"
 Fuckin with my niggaz D-Loc and Dalima
 They told me, "I really gotta be a muderer killin machine"
 I didn't care about nothing but rappin my way to the top
 Fuckin with my nigga Tech, He told me I'm hot
 Anybody got a problem with any one of my niggaz
 I'll pulled out the 9 milli up and to a pop
 Bring the heat, Bring the noise, Bring the flames
 Anything that you bring, Imma tame
 Puttin dirt on the top of my name
 Pull back and I click-click, bang
 Ask Tech, He'll tell you I'm strange
 If you ever wanna talk about me
 Imma run up, Gun up and leave you with no brain
 Then you'll know my flow is insane

[Chorus]
 I be on the West Coast, I be on the East Coast
 I be North, South, but I reside on my side, Midwest Chopper
 Even though I'm all up in the Northwest
 All across the U.S.
 Overseas, Midwest Choppers

Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh-Ay-Oh (You can't touch us)

 [ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/t/tech_n9ne/midwest_choppers_2.html ]
 Let me hit 'em
 When I get 'em, Imma split 'em, Imma kill 'em
 I'm the nigga with the lyrical venom, Finna get up in them
 When they give me the instrumental
 I finish 'em, diminish 'em
 I guarantee the murda is a minimum
 But lately I been givin 'em hell
 They don't really wanna see me, I'm so damn swell
 Call me a monster, Verse Designer, First To bomb ya
 Leathaface pullin up in that hearse beside ya
 Murda, mo murda, mo murda, mo murdered 'em all, kill 'em all
 Krayzie kill 'em all, they fall
 It's a lyrical execution
 We snap faster, We the rap masters
 Squeeze the gat, Blast it, If that's how it gots to be
 So they better get it ready
 Cause I'm heated like an AK-47 spittin bullet fuckin lyrics out of me
 Well that's somethin, That's crazy, Jackson
 He's amazin action, Stay in action
 Rap singin at ya, I'm blazin at ya
 I'm kinda like an automatic aimin at ya
 And I don't want a little bit of flame to ashes
 You know you really truely insane to madness
 You're never gonna find other niggaz more scandalous
 Than this Midwest blastin famly

[Chorus]
 I be on the West Coast, I be on the East Coast
 I be North, South, but I reside on my side, Midwest Chopper
 Even though I'm all up in the Northwest

[Tech N9ne]
 I am the definition of murda
 The N9ne is now coming to serve ya
 You're running but you can't go no furtha
 Cause I'm running through you with no sign of inertia

Gimme the mic and I bet that you duck
 It's what you betta do when I'm bussin
 I be flippin, I'm incredible, Never get on my level
 I'm a killa with the pedal to the medal
 You're edible and ya death is so inevitable
 I can take it to ya momma, Ya daddy, The back of a caddy
 You cut up in the sack with a baggy and I wanna... 
Take it out and make it patty
 You gotta be patty
 Cause that'll be bad if you decide to mad, Is you gonna?
 You can listen to me and see I'm the nigga with the ammunition
 I'm givin the livin a vision of death
 Makin 'em sick and depressed
 Cause I be givin everything
 I'm a rebel and I'm still with the quick and the best
 Makin 'em walk in the business
 Say get up in it to rip and diminish ya
 Trip and I finish ya
 Dig it, You really get me livid, I'm bout give it a pivot
 Imma stick it so we can differ to sinister
 I be the chopper that got ya little boppers goin off us
 Better not let me up on the premises
 Cause I'm a doctor that's out for the shotaz when I brought ya
 Be cautious never talk of this nemesis
 We on top of the hill when it come to the skill
 Other rappers are damn jokers
 They be givin the people comedy
 But the Tecca N9na misery shit is Bram Stoker

[Chorus]
 I be on the West Coast, I be on the East Coast
 I be North, South, but I reside on my side, Midwest Chopper
 Even though I'm all up in the Northwest

What up? Is this Tech N9ne?
Strange Music, homie
Tech Nina, baby
Hahaha, Caribou Lou
Hahaha

...
You're hilarious

Fuck you
You are a fucking asshole
Don't ever come past me or I'll make your life fucking Hell
I don't care who the fuck you are
You are a piece of fucking SHIT

I apologize
Like, honestly, I don't know what's going on
I am sorry for being freaking mean

So.. there's always something, right?
Some fuck shit
The first time, you lowered me to your door outside or something

Like there's something fucked up about you
I'm looking back, and my feelings are so in the past about you
Okay? Fuck you
This is my response
This is my reaction to what is your reality---

[Intro: Big Krizz Kalico & Tech N9ne]
Real cocky
Real sloppy
Drunk at the club and you all can't stop me

[Tech N9ne]
Super star style
Whoop the are pounds
Out the roof, scoop the group we be troopin' large crowds
Yes we are foul
And we rich now
Used to be all of me, but it's all on the bitch now
They wanna get me stuck, they commin' into my world
It's too late I got, my wife, my bitch, my girl

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
I was nineteen
Met a nice queen
Car was light green
Naughty as ice cream
But she too jealous Nickaleas
Sort of ridiculous
With the liffa kickin' it
We can never be inconspicuous (my bitch)
Rolls with me
It's so sickly
In love with me
But she give me Felicia 'ol hickeys
But go get me, in the wee hours to get me slow quickys
So sticky
Roll with my homies she so shifty (my wife)
Married a monster
Carried a youngsta
Said if you cheated it you will come back to hunt you
She said my filthy world
Makes her wanna hurl
And that's my first verse
My wife, my bitch, my girl

[Hook: Tech N9ne 2X]
Daddy told me that she wanna control the chick
She gotta go and blow her grip
Because it's all unload on a bitch
One is no trip
But two had mo lip
And three I just can't cope with
My wife, my bitch, my girl

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Got a nice anus
And it's right ain't it
Can't really touch durin' the day but in the night tame it
Usin' fight language
When she take inches
Great bitches
Gettin' busy on the weight benches (my bitch)
Got a big butt
A big slut
Who get big bucks
You might look up and get your chick sucked
'cause she's bi-sex
Keep her thighs wet
Spontaneous I don't know what we gonna try next (my wife)
Go a ghetto booty like Naomi
I'm gonna tell you like Jayo say
All my bitches havin' fancy dreams
And all my bitches wear Applebottom jeans
My wife, my bitch, my girl

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
If one's trippin'
The other's for fun flippin'
You coo
She run's limpin'
You end up with funds missin'
You foo
Come wicked your women become vicious and cruel
Dump checkin' to some funds with some checks and you loose
Out of balance the playalistical values and lyin'
I done challenged the way of Mystical powers and hinted
I can silence an egotistical chick in a fight
I'm defiant with an evil twist my girl, my bitch, and my wife
Ain't no bitch on this planet that is a match for me
They get sick and they stand it cause Ninna packs the three
Have to be
Crash to see
If naturally to cause a catastrophe
Exactly (my wife)
Don't like me (my bitch)
Get's hyphy (my girl)
Might knife me twice just to spite me (my wife)
If I break her heart (my bitch)
It'll rip her apart (my girl)
But I'm the smarter you all (my wife, my bitch, my girl)

[Hook 4X]---Lyrics submitted by luke.

Inside joke is outside now

No K?
Just another way me and my crew say, "No way"
Or "It's not okay" when I got the bottles pay
And somebody you don't know that wanna swallow say
"I don't got no grip but want a sip." No K
"Can I take yo blunt right to my lips?" No K
Broke ass always begging me that's No K
You don't understand then bitch, no way
See you ballin', gotta tell 'em, "No K"
Lookin' like a money bag, smellin' Dolce
Hungry lookin' at you like the fella at Chipotle
All you gotta tell 'em when they're hailin', "Go play"
We flyin', you tryin', to get a check sit next to who's buyin'
She wanna sex a vet, never request a net and love Tech for Tech, but you lyin'
Hey, and that's no K, get away and the bitch best obey
Tryin' to use sex to get yo way but the greed negated everything that ho say
And she play it out like exposé, tryin' to get quality time like, "Let's crochet."
Got me thinkin' of chinnin' some underhanded women but I never hit a woman so I'mma fetch Solé
And then you whine sayin', "That's no k." (Heh Heh Heh)
Sayin' if you got to hand out, stop ya damn mouth
Ain't none of my fault you get low pay
So needy (Ha), I'm on ace of spades and you ...
They wanna try and get whatever you got
Wanna wear the chain and watch, I'ma say, "No K."

No K, that's what I say when I don't really wanna
Say that it's all right but it's all right (No, no, no)
No K, that's what I tell you when I ain't just trynna
Talk to you all night
(Noo-ohh) Can't get my money
(Noo-ohh) That's not okay
(Noo-ohh) And I'm one hunnit
(Noo-ohh) So I'ma tell you that's okay

No K
She my bitch but I ain't finna giv her her none of my pay
No way, no how, no what?
Bitch, I don't give a motherfuck
It's paper over pussy, P-O-P
Celebrity get everything for free
If you can't swim, you gon' drown
Throw a bitch up in the air and break her 'fore she hit the ground
No K No K, No K No K
This ain't broadway, no play
From the track, from the cage, from the swim, from the mud
Words hella hate, no love
No suckers allowed in my cap and hell no, you can't hit my weed you tramp
Wanna stand on the stage? No K, you can't
Ride on my bus? No K, you can't
Why you always got ya hand out? All you do is pout like a woman
Grown man, act like niggas owe you somethin'
Habitual liar, always lyin' for nothin'
Start a lot of shit and be the first one runnin'
No K, prolly showin' hella niggas in the game
Like Jose, AK, AK-47 to a nigga brain
Get him out the way---

[Verse 1: ~Tech N9ne~]
Raised in the middle of the land full of barbaque stands and the brothers throw hands*
Every buddy gritten gettin grands Kansas city were the pretty women make you say DWAM!
Kicks it like a donkey cause we famous
Wicked women want me cause I came up
This is were the homies trip and say what
Yo we from the show me get my money and we pay up
Got on my Five o Ones and my gritter posture

If she papered I'm in her choppers
Lettin' her know this ninna dinner cost her
And I'm famous squash her so animal like someone better get her doctor
This boys born and raised in KC M.I.Z.Z.O.U.
But once in a while I hit the L.K. for ladies
Cause they straight be in K.U.
Then back to Kansas city were is gates all on they plate
We think about it and we crave it when we vacate
I represent the MO and all the way to K state
Call me Tech N9ne but teachers and students call me A. Yates

[Hook: ~Tech N9ne~]
I'm hella fine like the food at Ollie Gates
Strawberry baked bean mixed plate
So everybody just bounce rock skate
Cant wait O.G. Ollie Gates
O.G. Like Ollie Gates
O.G. Like Ollie Gates
O.G. Ollie Gates
O.G. Baby
This is Kansas City

[Verse 2: ~Tech N9ne~]
We be scoutin pretty young things yo we got are selves in
Like dun deal I'm a popper Blouzin

Rest In Peace baby

Teach babyz we used to listen to this at least 80
We kansas city steppin no question
[ Tech N9ne Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ] 
We reppin 56 and 57 we know that if he jeffen then hes shady
K.C.K.'s gate got the chicken wing this'ell bring
Traffic when the people kick in things
So you better be listening cause the don is sniffin green
This is the mission get ya when you hittin your nicotine
They got your money man and you know that they aint
Somethin delicous yea you know the trey say gates
That's the place were they come and getcha if the pay late
But I stay great cause everyones bangin the A. Yates

[Repeat Hook:]

[Verse 3: ~Tech N9ne~]
North side where is you (HEY!)
South side where is you (HEY!)
East side where is you (HEY!)
West side, what it do? (HEY!) (TECH N9NE)
Ain't no body's sauce like this
Ain't no other barbaque boss like this
The feel rellay might cost quite a bit
Ya we do it but the fire ain't brought like this
O.G. told me go see
If the other city's Q is G.O.O.D.
But he knew that id find out slowly
Just like my KC barbaque they cannot hold me, A. Yates

[Hook:]
I'm hella fine like the food at Ollie Gates
Strawberry baked bean mixed plate

Can't wait

Niggas in Missou ain't changed
Make ya have to let loose thangs

Have you ever seen a MAC-11?
New TEC-9 with the extension
HK, AK-47
Mayday, man down, call the reverend

I put that on the bible boy, count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy, count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy, count your blessings
Put that on the bible boy, count your blessings

I felt like they tone said "I'm comin' to get ya"
Well, that's when all of the heavy artillery come in the picture
And luckily cause of your past, you can have someone assist ya
I was raised a cool brother but these motherfuckers went and summoned a nigga!
I swore to never let a man's hand take me to my grave nigga
With my fortune, I'mma get to torchin', like Orkin I spray nigga
I know they dyin' to get it with the N9ne
That's fine, they wanna make a nigga do the woop
So I'mma take the carbine and put it to ya mind
It's goin' through you, not around ya like a hula hoop
Put that on the bible, if ya fuckin' with Tech, get the rifles
Totally trippin', tryna take my title, lift you right up in the sky with the Eiffel
If you psycho, you can do this, if he chooses to be foolish
The gun never loses, never give you the deuces
Nigga, this is Su'Wu biz, ahh!
Let me calm my nerves, I'mma simply put this on the word
If ya hella aggravated cause of a song ya heard from the Nina I smoke a nigga like my ganja herb
I'm on the verge, no life beyond the surge
When I bomb, ya served, what does one deserve?
But a head stomppin', now put ya teeth on the curb, nigga!?

Aye, fuck all that goin' back and forth with a nigga
Got a problem, what he really wanna do?
If you know like I know, then you know, true
And niggas make songs but they really don't do
What they say, got guns but they really won't shoot
He afraid, I'll lay a nigga down right now
Face to the concrete, nose to the ground
Do him in the streets 'fore his prayers hit the cloud
And the flash and a bang, it is rarely allowed
But a whole body down and a hole in the ground
Dig one for the niggas who be holdin' ya down
Better know I got rounds and they will go around, it's enough
Eat a bullet from the four-pound if ya tough
And then let the choppa spray ya down and get up
Ya pull that off, I'll believe you ain't soft
Otherwise, nigga you just soft as all them other guys
I'll kill ya dead and I put that on my mother eyes
Don't listen to these niggas, they just kick a bunch of lies
How they got a bunch of guns? Shot 'em all a bunch of times
I really do believe Tech got a bunch of nines
Before they gave my nigga Meech a bunch of time
I really know my nigga Young had a bunch of pies
For the low, all my niggas had it for the high
So you believe them niggas out there talking bout they BMF?
They should be them niggas, none of mine
I know Young got it bout what he rap bout
I really pulled Meek Millz out the trap house
Just like I seen Doe B with a OZ
Turn around, two weeks, had a whole ki
Just cause I said as a joke that the dope game dead
Like this, God, a nigga went and showed me
Guess what I'm tryna say is, nigga, I don't know you
And futhermore, pussy nigga, I don't want to

Haahahahahaha!
Man, we just killed a small village man
You know what I'm sayin'?
This hip-hop, aha! Love this shit---

Just give me one good time 
Nobody is looking at me anyway 
Nobody is looking at me anyway 
Yo 
Yo 
I know that I’m Hardcore 
Know how to start wars 
Know how to scar yours in a fist fight 
Cause toughness is our floor 
Warriors that bond more 
But this one is far tore up on this night 
Some people show it 
And then 
Some people hide it 
But other people 
Do it whenever they get excited 
But me 
I can’t even do it 
When the wrongs on mind 
I’m saying i been trying to do it for a long long time 
i get jealous when i see people do it 
And it’s like fluid 
I’m thinking 
How can they swallow that 
When I can’t even chew it 
I guess 
God seen it fit 
To label me the consouller 
bestowed upon a bro and forever be the shoulder 
My mission is plain to see 
Its freaking insanity 
I’m wishing the pain in me would just leave me be why can’t it be 
Simple cause on the real 
This one could die 
So I’m asking god 
Before I go 

Just give me one good cry 

If I could cry maybe one good time i could wash away all my pain 
And maybe free my mind 
After my shows it’s a lonely road 
Sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul 
No body’s looking at me anyway 
Just give me one good time 
No body’s looking at me anyway 

Why I got to be the one to cheer up 
People till they clear up 
When I sneeze I tear up 
And then I go look in a mirror 
So I can see how it looks 
When I really wanna know how it feels 
When I’m hella down I try to push 
No matter how hard no water spills 
For real 
My patients is soon to go 
waiting for the balloon to blow 
I’m thinking back to when i used to go to funerals 
No matter how close we were 
On the inside it ain’t wild 
Others be losing it 
I’m just wishing I could just break down 
And I been to a lot of them 
And there’s not a one 
That went on and got it done 
No moisture that even try even to come 
And this ain’t no tough thing, because I’ve had enough pain 
Tears should be runnin like mustangs 
Man it must rain 
Been trying for years 
But the crying been inside 
N the ninas so serious there ain’t no lying in his eyes 
Makes me so furious 
When I look n im a genocide 
Please let me break down with the pain i felt when Brian Dennis died 

If I could cry maybe one good time i could wash away all my pain 
And maybe free my mind 
After my shows it’s a lonely road 
Sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul 
No body’s looking at me anyway 
Just give me one good time 
No body’s looking at me anyway 

I look at actors crying 
It’s as easy as fondue 
But what do you do when extreme hurt is upon you? 
Real life ain’t no movie homie 
And this ain’t Jon woe 
But I almost lost it on the ending of Jon q 
And I almost lost it when Jennifer Hudson blew 
But I’m still waiting for that real emotion to come thru 
But then maybe I could get a cry god 
Maybe one too 
Been red for life for the first time ever 
Me want blue 
Give me the blues 
Sometimes I turn on the news 
And I 
Look at all these feuds 
Then I try to make them ooze 
but no cry 
no tear drops from your eyes 
poetry's music oh my 
almost make me tear up when thinkin about my children, no lie 
Maybe I’m black hearted 
You thinking damn he shady 
Saying man he crazy 
For the way I abandon me lady 
One day she can repay me 
Yes that woman can betray me 
Then ill probably cry if not than I do it if I win me a Grammy maybe 

If I could cry maybe one good time I could wash away all my pain 
And maybe free my mind 
After my shows it’s a lonely road 
Sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul 
No body’s looking at me anyway 
Just give me one good time 
No body’s looking at me anyway---Lyrics submitted by Justice.

If i ever go away.......
If i ever go..if i ever go... if i ever go...
If i ever go away....

I want everybody that loves me to be...

[Chorus]
Ridin Paseo, not in the day though, 
Cherish the day, but then roll out when the day go,
Ridin away yo pain and sorrow, 
Live for today cause you might not see tomorrow

Ridin Paseo, not in the day though, 
Cherish the day, but then roll out when the day go,
Ridin away yo pain and sorrow, 
Live for today cause you might not see tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Roses are red and violets are blue,
And we all get purple rain when you put together the 2
True, lets talk about this street i know 
Meta meta yo is needed when its time for me to go
I spent my whole life on this KC street
The PASEO where the real stay and the fake sees heat
Gangstas lay low, get the queso and everyday breathe deep
But when the day goes all the broads out cause the baby's sleep
On Paseo i reminisce if they love me then give em this
Never know when to go cause this life is so hit and miss
Cry for me? never just have a ball wit each other 
Cause thats what i had thanks goes out to my father and mother 
And i love you so mama 
If i ever happen to go mama 
I think theres something you should know mama
I stayed away cause i was tryin to become somethin 
Give a house to that one woman 
The reason everyone's bumpin.....

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Lets take a journey startin at 85th, wrote some of my latest hits
Off 85th came back from Cali then i stayed with Chris
Off 76th my first baby was conceived
Off 75th was with slow mo in conditions you wouldn't believe
74th and Paseo on the corner
Slept with the AK for my homie Scoob
Any body came through that door was a gonner
64th i ate balogna and kicked it with mac and sonya
In French Village i sold dope for my folks in a place with a crack aroma
63rd street is the land (and in Bishop Hogan)?
Demandin yall just keep rollin
(expandin on bishop strollin)?
Mastered music on 61st
If i didnt use it i would spit the verse
This is how how you find me if demons happen to hit me first
Right on 58th i lived from 12 to 17 with basima kechramin , marty, hassan and hakim
57th and 56th i had a ball i learned some tricks i learned some schemes 
From my homeboys yall know who i mean
RDVs 55th paul's liquor try and talk slick if you crazy
Results in getting stomped by doc and stu-baby
Keep ridin paseo for me 
If you ridin solo tonight 
Just keep on thinkin marco polo for life when you're...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Whats the paseo hah
49th street
On 47th is gates and sons where Tech N9ne eats
39th at the bootleg i used to find peace
But at the scottish right on lynnwood masons at times meet
I used to kick it on 27th and 28th (true's lake)
Careful...you might find yourself off in that piece if you hate
19th was my family's church they tried to save me too late
Cause doin shows on 18th and vine that was my true fate
Mary Lou Williams was my aunt 
9th where i was raised
Way minor way back in the day they used to fight no one was framed
But now on independence ave i hear my son donnie 
Sayin that he hear gunshots every night on 5th and it scares his momma ronnie 
End of the road 29 north to the bridge
If i go im leavin everything to my wife and my kids
Travis if i go whatever my half is you give her 
And no funeral just throw my ashes in the Missouri River...Love.

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by randee.

[Intro]
The Hole
Click Click
Mmmmmm Uuuurr no I cant do it (can't do it, can't do it)
Fuck this
Click Click
I gotta, I wanna
MMM

[Verse 1]
My pain killer's in my dresser
Right next to my rester
What insane brain would agree to this gesture
Too unjest less stress left with no extra
You's a mess, true depressed steps can infect ya
I'm a product of some shit gone wrong
Even though I speak to many with a hit song tone
Even though I'm famous and I'm givin' chicks long dong
Man I feel like a copper top just a sick stone drone
One flew over the cuckoos nest
And he cashed some buku checks
But he was not mentally stable the crew new tech
As a phenomenon but karma wanna noose dude's necks
Designer of death get to choose who's next
Is it real to you but if you got evil your kind to come and steal a few
Condemn souls 'cause of what the old pain killer do
Keep having these dreams of my taking my nine milli
Who can help me execute this desire to pop a pill or two

[Hook]
You cant give me medical attention to ease my pain
Sometimes I feel helpess and need something to relieve my brain
You may love your M.D.
But he has none in store for me
So when the raining bores on me
My dream for fillers, pain killer

[Verse 2]
My pain comes from me being a fuck up
With strange music we really, we lucked up
Cause being a lost soul got my bucks up
Even though my cerebral cortex and spirit needed a touch up
Everybody around me hurtin and shit
Well everybody on tv kickin it reject jerkin and shit
I'll be the one on stage and studios stressed out workin' and spit
This shit to the people and I know that I gotta alot of evil lurkin in quick
Women want me want me
So they flaunt thee monkey
Even doin' sex sometimes, a heap of stress still wants to haunt me
When I grab the yalk she couldn't talk and it was no humpty dumpty
Even though im sick in the head we kick it like a donkey don't we
My apology to anyone labeled a victim
And I'm losin' my mind I just picked up the nine and I gripped 'em
And I put it off in that direction like I was the kiss one
I always think of the day when I'm able to pull back and I click em

[Hook]
You cant give me medical attention to ease my pain
Sometimes I feel helpless and need something to relieve my brain
You may love your M.D.
But he has none in store for me
So when the raining bores on me
My dream for fillers, pain killers

[Verse 3]
No meds for me
Just left for me
Any light inside my head is just to dead to see
Any kind of way out of this hole can I
Pull this darkness outta this soul
Lotta people really wanna know how it's so
Cause a lot of motherfuckers have been down this globe
And I'm one of them
You can see it on the television, everybody trippin' and it's a ton of em
Straight feelin' that pain go insane
Then bang and it ain't no none of em
Many ways to end these days
When the darkness really wanna shun the sun
Ten million ways to die when you constantly cry and the gun is one

[Hook]
You cant give me medical attention to ease my pain
(tired of getting my shit like this man, I'm done with this fucking music man)
Sometimes I feel helpless and need something to relieve my brain
You may love your M.D
But he has none in store for me
So when the raining bores on me
My dream for fillers, pain killers ---Lyrics submitted by Tedi LaBelle.

[Intro]
Man lives in a sun lit world, of what he believes to be, reality.
But, there is unseen by most an underworld that is just as real.
But not, as brightly lit, a DARKSIDE! 

[Chorus]
(DARKNESS)
I can write a verse and take the sun away.
(DARKNESS)
Say good bye to light because it's gone today.
(DARKNESS)
Ain't no smiling happiness is done away.
(DARKNESS)
Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away.
Run away.

[Tech N9ne]
I don't really give of fuck what you think of me I had it up to here, yep.
Follow me into another de-mention of insanity's right here, step.
I know your feelin' it I'm lovin' you when I'm kissin' n' fuckin' you in a minute I'm a veer, left.
An by the pluck of the jugular see the blood of my lover and then I finish when your near, death.
I'm sorry, but I mean it cause when I got the tool on bitch I got bulimic.
Up in her like a gynecologist with a penis.
And when they bled on me I was giddy and never squeamish.
Bad as a demon I cannot get rid of her I really rely on the feelin of the sex an the red of a woman.
Can I take a bite of your cerebellum I think it'll really get me up if I could be suckin your seratonin. 
I'd rather just die than inflict any pain on somebody who truly put trusted me.
Better yet I just make her the suffer who taught me mocked me n fucked with me.
Maybe get up in the club and shoot it up and makem panic at the disco. (backwards)Fuck you if devils are what you worship.
I can paint a dark picture.
You don't want me to start, with cha.
Don't want me commin with the heart, hit cha.
Chew you up and if you really tart, spit cha.
After the brain I put the lemon moraine in.
Blood of a dame is what I drain my fang's in.
Takein the spirit and the body it came in.
Away from the sun and forever you can remain in.

[Chorus x2]
(DARKNESS)
I can write a verse and take the sun away.
(DARKNESS)
Say good bye to light because it's gone today.
(DARKNESS)
Ain't no smiling happiness is done away.

Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away.
Run away.

[Dirtball]
When I'm all up on a pallet a pain with blood of my name in vain sun up in it
Imna break it down the walls n try to stop me from poppin my gun up in it
Skits onta me honor me for the time never given to the rhyme in another mind lookin like a
nice guy
Behind the face be the beast of another mutha fucka that be heard the least.
So many here me when I say they can, that I remember everybody that layd me astray. yo fuckem.
Nobody but my closest know about my darkness and when they fall away. yo fuckm.
I'm to sick that I never checked outa my mental-ward working in sweden
Burin the bodies this song made my memory feedm ghost made me loud and I'm proud I can see them
I don't even wanna talk about it but I do it for the demons and the devils alive
Hopin' that the nonbelievers get a number two in the eye please try to die save me the time
When I make a move when I'm commin through I'm a stay devoted to rhyme [x9]
Devoted to mine hex sign ruda wicked I'm a be forever de-dine
Picture this my wrist silt pissed off I'm hangin from a meat hook,
Yo I'm bangin on a meat hook it's the twist this chapter ya miss the darker the venom of a
main hook book
I'm tellin everybody I'm not doin so well I'm feelin my noggin to you better watch ya self
Sub-noise when I'm bangin on a tech set best believe the dark times are here my lips eclipse
everything

[Chorus x2]

I can write a verse and take the sun away.
(DARKNESS)
Say good bye to light because it's gone today.
(DARKNESS)
Ain't no smiling happiness is done away.
(DARKNESS)
Watch me paint a pic that'll make you run away.
RUN AWAY!

I'm your worst fear.
I'm your favorite.
I'm your acquired taste.
Will you savor it.
If its blood thirst, will you run from it.
No need cause I'm inside you.
When the sun is spit.
You cannot escape me
I'm your last resort.
When you have an evil, you cannot report.
I'm am the royal sunshine, malicious pain and heartless.
If ever you ever need an alibi, rely on me I am.

[Chorus x2]
(DARKNESS)
I can write a verse and take the sun away.
(DARKNESS)
Say good bye to light because it's gone today.

Real killas move in silence
Quiet storm, such a tyrant
Murderer stays vibrant
If I choose, she's a giant
Anger breathes defiance
When she's on, no compliance
Cause her demon needs violence
Don't give her no love, never wanna fold up
Then you better hold up cause she cray

You're just a shady bitch on a daily on some crazy shit
Don't fuck around with a lady, it'll be a blaze where your mercedez sit
Eighty-six the baby bit, you don't wanna run into my radius
Maybe get you rabies sick and the gravy is (Ain't that about a bitch)
When you date the girl and you make the girl
And she fuckin' with another man'll make you hurl
She methodical with a chain and gonna break ya world
Taste the world of a shotgun, aught one, in the head nigga not fun
But you really wanna pop some
... can the ... even drop when he got done
Your imagination, kills you when it's so bad it's aching
And what's your status? hatin', a whole lot of aggravation
Cause shes kickin' it with this rapper, and that rapper
And that factor get a gat clapper
Gotta mash after with a blast at her
Silly bitches don't consider your feelings
They make you think that the love is real when you chilling
But when you turn away, she gets to illin' with another nigga
Prolly drilling for real and you know his music and he knows yours too
Ain't no limits to what your whore do
Pillow talking with her no more true
Lovin' when I catch up with 'em, bro you're through

Aye bro the bitch that you fuckin' with, man, she was in the club last night with that rap. What's up with that?
Forreal?
Yeah, nigga. They were together, my nigga

Wishing you never heard of a (Psycho bitch)
Bitch will make you murderer, she's a (Psycho bitch)
Psycho breedin', believe it (Psycho bitch)
Don't pack nothing, ust leave it (Psycho bitch)
She can be peaceful, and people that's peepin' they see this evil freak in you
Freakin' you, make you repeat it like it's a sequel
Better run when you see a (Psycho bitch)
Cause your bitch might be a (Psycho bitch)
Yeah, yeah

This bitch, talking to me in this alley, she love me to bits
But on the other end she really takin' the dick
I never knew she was evil, my nigga told me that he caught her with him in the mix
That is when I get to trippin' and having a fit
He think he witty, she told him we broke up, uh
Taking the dick, on my penis she choke up, uh
He know I'm tripping cause she fuckin' telling him, uh
He gonna feel it when I put the hell in him, cha

I'm outraged cause I've been lied to
If I happen to catch her with him, she can die too
Used to be my boo, now shes sucking some guy's goo
Wanna divide two and dump 'em both in the bayou
Steppin' with my crew, I'm coming to fight you
Bullets gonna fly through whoever's walkin' beside you
I never liked to untake the knot out of a tied shoe
I'm bout to slide through and bang him, nigga this is pyru

Hello

How you get my cell phone number nigga
Are you fuckin' her?
Hahaha

Bitch will make you murderer, she's a (Psycho bitch)

She can be peaceful, and people that's peepin' they see this evil freak in you
Freakin' you, make you repeat it like it's a sequel
Better run when you see a (Psycho bitch)
Cause your bitch might be a (Psycho bitch)
Yeah, yeah

Bitch where the fuck you been? I've been calling yo ass since last night
You runnin' some shit? You sucking some dick? Oh, you was with Rachel, is that right?
Hmmm, okay, guess I was wrong, case closed then
Now you got one more time to lie before you get your face broken
So stay focused, I ain't jokin'
You slept with a nigga, think I ain't noticed?
Just wanna game on me like I ain't your man?
Trying to come back home? I don't think so bitch
Gimme your phone (No) Gimme that shit, stop wrestling
You're making me use aggression, Trynna see who you texting
WHOA, oh bitch, I'm going to jail fo' sho

[Tech N9ne:]
I now pronounce me and music together from now until the end of time

Always on the road, Doin hella shows
Day to day high and lows, but that's just how it goes
When you grinding, homie ain't no rewinding
Time but the family behind in this business that I'm in
I don't feel anything and it's hard remembering
Places and faces they think I'm what December brings
The day is just like moments turned to hours ,
Autographs, sound check, radio spots and quick showers
Hit the stage and get so much love from the fans,
Keep it rough with the fellas, but I make the ladies want to dance
And still I don't think you understand what's real,
While I'm with you with my wife another chance is killed,
And my kids all three of 'em suffer in the worst ways,
Cause last year I missed all three of they birthdays,
So when you see me with me eyes full of pain,
Give me love cause these are three of the reason why I call the road 'the rain'

[Chorus: Tech N9ne]
So here we are now (In the rain)
A superstar now, (In the rain)
So far now, (In the rain)
The Rain (I'm walking in rain)
I live my life like (In the rain)
Just for the limelight (Is it right or is it wrong)

My little girl said

[Aliya Yates:]
Daddy (What's up), me and Reign really miss you,
Not to mention momma always need a tissue,
I saw your picture in the paper and I kissed you,
I heard you won't be home for Halloween, is this true?
(Right after Halloween baby)
Yea I'm used to it,
Why don't you teach me and Reign how to produce music,
So we can travel everywhere that you're traveling,
And be in the family, me and sissy fighting and tattling
I know you miss that, I know you dig that
Do your fans every wonder about where your kids at?
Is Donny really coming to move with us in L.A.?
Will mommy still love you and be with you everyday?
I gotta go now, I love you daddy but slow down
There's not enough Techa Nina's to go around
Rainbow's crying she wants to talk to you badly,
(What's up Rainbow, Baby)

[Reign Yates]
I love you daddy!

[Chorus:]
So here we are now (In the rain)
A superstar now, (In the rain)
So far now, (In the rain)
The Rain (I'm walking in rain)
I live my life like (In the rain)
Just for the limelight (Is it right or is it wrong)

I love my fans
Cause they make it possible for me to provide for the Fam
The fact that my life is in shambles, they could give a damn
When it shakes then they chose it, fakes who hate lose it
They love my pain because it makes for great music
But in the interim this family matter is a tend to one of mine
Leave in January and come back when the winter come like:
Calling my wife when I'm in the rain and then end up getting into a dumb fight
Cause she lonely, you try to console her but you ain't come right
So it's about what and what?
You give them everything they need,
But what they need is your presence indeed,
Life yes has been a strainer
It's like if been a stranger
To my kids and wife
That's the life of an entertainer
More money to gain,
More people to change
Swords deep in the game,
The world's peeping my pain
Out on the road cussing for sure, reaching for fame
Healthy relationship you can't have them when you're living life in 'the rain'.

[Chorus x2:]
So here we are now (In the rain)
A superstar now, (In the rain)
So far now, (In the rain)

Man I ain't about to pay 20 thousand dollas for no god damn DJ to play my mothafuckin' song nigga you why did you play it? You know I've always been like a humble dude but... I've come to the reliz realization that... and ima say this and the first time I've ever said this on camera and ima give it to yall first cause i'm truly on fuck everybody type shit right now (well make sure I get to plug in)... ima say... no one can beat us makin music man... when i say fuck you nigga you know what i'm sayin these mothafuckas sayin...

Chorus
That's wierd people act a different way with me
I feel like nobody wanna play with me
And that's ill cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes
The industry are my foes they treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose...red nose...
They put me down and treat me like I got a red nose
Red nose... red nose...
Don't make me clown and have to go put on my red nose.

Verse One
I got my face painted crazed ain't it
That a black dude lookin like he got a white tattoo
People thinkin that he way tainted
By evil, treat u like fecal wanna beef you when they meet you
People percieve you to be lethal
When you ain't see through like tissue (grunt)
I feel like the industry gettin me with this stupidity
willing to distribute these fictious sissies when i rip
it so serious and wickedly, no forgiving thee
when im claimin Strange, everyone tellin me im
a sane Ward Bane, im a independent talented
individual workin, but the industry is the reindeer game,
and they call me rudolph the red,
they know im rippin the the mic when i chew off the head,
spit it at the PD's & DJ's & VD's & TV"s 
you thinkin that u got threw off the ledge,
if u tough me snuff me, homie trust me nothin,
its worse then knowing your beautiful,
but your treated like an ugly duckling,
so im Rocky Dennis, but im so polished nothin can stop me in this,
battlin the planet does not replenish,
the fakes who immitate and mock me finish, (grunt)
We checked the Mill, yes its real,
through Strange i dont need your major record deal

Chorus

Verse Two
They tend to stray away from me because im different,
And its been this way with me ever since i was an infant,
All the kids were jealous, they said the look off my eyes seemed hellish,
Never knowin later in life i would rellish,
the thought of me ballin, livin my life, and sell it, (grunt)
I blame it on program directors, go and request us,
no damn selector, but if u gotta lotta 
dough man they bless ya, shit can depress ya
when ya knowin that there aint no one betta mane,
stuck off in the cold, when the bad weather came,
now they gotta see me livin it up through the cheddar gain,
commin from a pain, to another reign,
so i throw up the finger, to everbody who got a tow up demeanor,
thinkin that tech nina was sho nuff a dreamer,
but the flows so heavy it could show up Katrina
now its time to face, and you all must face it,
tech nina is sacred, all you hatin faggots couldnt see me with lasik,
Red nose, the leader so follow,  
you gotta be ready to get up and go ii the motto,
runnin through everything negative bravo,
the monetythats commin to me feel like i won the lotto, (grunt)
Now im about to put the sleigh on auto,
swoop down on the DJ, tell him to quit the replay,
neva put tech nina in the Sarato

Part of chorus

Its wierd people act a different way with me,
I feel like nobody wanna play wit me,
And thats ill cause they treat me like a stain on they clothes,
the industry are my foes they treat me like i got a Red nose... red nose
they put me down and treat me like i got a red nose

Verse Three
Im commin and drivin my short bus,
with this nose i dont need a torcha,
bustin through like the industries porsha,
commin after who didnt support us,
rip down its bleachers, i blew up cause my sound is ether,
underground, ive been found this creature,
not scared of a nigga with clownish features, (grunt)
im makin a name outside your mainstream
real, it wasnt an insane dream, 
from the beginning i really came clean,
you about to see Strange gleam, takin over in gangreen,
Strange Muzic and RBC, alone with Funterror,
we gonna change things,
Now its not funny cause with the money i can fly away,
???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Why do they do me wrong, my musics truly strong,
Because im different all you cowards wanna see me gone,
This is the Strange year, world wide fames near,
But the games quire, sometimes i feel like im rudolph the reindeer,
And the music they said blows, is on top of the Craig Grove,
Yall gonna have to open the doo for the bro with the red nose.

Chorus---Lyrics submitted by Joseph.

This song is dedicated to Bryon B'zl Dennis, and all of the 57th street rogue dog villains
Real riot makers
This one right here's for the riot makers, the moshers, the surfers and jaw breakers

We gon' start this shit off right, we got KCMO in the house tonight
We gon' start this shit off right, we got Tecca Nina in the house tonight
Come on!

This is the moment for riders and thugs
Strippers and body bag zippers and violence and drugs
Poverty, a bunch of minorities die in the club
They say my music's makin 'em lose it, I write it in blood

This is my music for all my people missin' my music
Keep listenin to it, ain't like I said, "get a pistol and use it"
Satan shot my homie maintain with a missile and blew it
For the industry, cuz he was one of the truest

I don't know why they be funkin' it's somethin
Maybe in the music when it be pumpin'
It's crunk and it's hella hateriffic (hateriffic)
Throw your set up in the air is all the dj really wanna play
When it's over it's lookin' bloody and satanistic (satanistic)

Killas from everywhere listen to me when I be bussin' shit
I'm turbulent some get nervous when I wreck arenas (wreck arenas)
Concert promoters in Honolulu don't wanna see me
Cuz they said that Samoans will riot off Tecca Nina

CHORUS:
Cause imma riot maker. that's if you don't know 
Imma riot maker. they mosh at my show
Imma riot maker and I come out bussin' 
Imma riot maker (riot maker) I don't give a damn about nothin'
Slide faker, imma skyscraper, riot maker

Hop in a mosh pit fa sho!
You push, you shove, you get elbowed!

Back on cuz this for fat tone and mac dre
All of the soldiers who got gone on that day
All my people sittin' in prison
This is for you so won't you listen to the shit that I'm spittin

Fuck the law man the government they'll hymn yo ass up
They'll do everything in their power to get a fast buck
No right or wrong, just killer bees out for your honeycomb
Bet you find out when you bond out you can be free if your money long

Ever been to one of my shows yeah, it might be crazy
In Ohio a chick got a little too hyphy, baby
Stage diving and crowd surfing couldn't hold back
But they dropped her, now she's unconscious with her skull cracked

Now when this happened, it wasn't even during my set
They wanted me to give a signed poster to the hospital bet
When travis told me we got papers, I thought he was playin'
This bitch is suin' Tecca Nina for one hundred grand

(CHORUS)

Stand back if you're frightened!
Yeah! get back cuz we fightin!

I'm a skyscraper
That's why everybody in my past is trynna get a little piece of my paper
Man I swear, the Nina will never love them, plug them
When I'm rollin with Skatterman and Snug Brim!

(Skatterman)
It's skatterman, cat, strange music's black sheep (why?)
Cuz I'm still countin' money off the back streets
Every city, every show, I gotta pack heat
This ain't no fuckin' rap song, check my rap sheet

I'm one of a kind, turn one into nine
Blow your head off your shoulders dog, it's nothin' but time
And I never raise my voice, you a bum, why should I holla on you?
With a whisper I can drop a couple dollas on you

S-s-sick them rottweilers on you
Killas bustin' out the windows of Impalas on ya
A made man, in the streets I made grands
Wrote lyrics about my life, dropped the album, and made fans

Now I'm chillin on tour with the redhead wonder
Did 57 shows in a three month summer 
On the deuce next bitch ass nigga fuckin with tech
Gonna be found in swope park with his nuts in his neck

[Snug brim]
Like you ain't know we put it down like this
Snug brim kansas city missouri uzi, groupie, doobies & fifths
You suzie q's ain't no excuse for the sick so watch your tongue if you're whoopin'
I'll get to shootin' over you and your bitch

You just assume you tried the shoes and they fit
You never knew that I lose you off in the section with your dude in the ditch
Whether its rappin' dog or movin' them bricks I keep it gutter lil' homey
Look my record see i'm doin' it thick

As you can tell I ain't no regular nigga (i'm filled with star quality)
Blow indo with bitches that's naked (and watch your broad swallow me)
It's only so long you can fake it (so don't try to follow me)
And still can't get back up on your feet (found right back where you ought to be)

I see you frownin' cuz strange music got it locked boy
Invest your stock boy kansas city hot boys
It's real and fuck the hataz, smoke your weed, get your paper 
You can see me now or later, mother fuckin' riot maker

(CHORUS)

We will shut this muthafucka down!
We will tear up your muthafuckin' town!

Since 1985 six, six, triple eight, forty six, ninety nine, three.
Welcome to everready.
En-enjoy---Lyrics submitted by Mik.

Those who are not real!

ROAD KILL!
Push, pull, kick, aim, squeeze, drill

[Verse 1: Kutt Kalhoun]
I got this bitch named Janae from Olathe
Baby girl was flavor
Bitch is in sexual favors
Told me I could take it
Got a fettish addicted to pain
Wanted me to choke her
While she sat on my dick came
All over the sofa
But this hoe from the o she was cold
Didn't like to swallow it
A pull to the back of the throat
Kept a bitch from vomittin
She begged for a dick in her ass
Baby liked it anal
But my head was too big for her ass
So I used my fingers
Down to Dallas with Rita & Alice
White and Phillipino
One on my dick and one tossin my salad
Off in the casino
Real sex ain't got shit on these vets
Told em they could keep me
Even thought about writin the check

To all em bitches and hoes that leave your life unexposed

Thank you for the paper
Never given a fuck about what your bitch is thinking pety shit is second nature
Throw em in the mix nigga fuck em witha friend

[Verse 1 - Tech N9ne]
Ey
My momma, my momma, my momma is so tormented
She been through trauma, more drama
The dawn is gone, it's more tinted
On this side it get's out of it
How does a prophet who loved God as his father's slippin' to get the bottomless side of it
How come an angel gotta be sick in the pancreas like she an athiest
Maybe it's the faith that is makin' this lady as crazy and has made me this skeptic
Next threat is Lupis on top of Epiliptic, Never rested
Psychiatrist forever tested, Reverend blessed it
Brethren, Heaven, Tech is beggin' for effin' X-Mas
Hopin' momma ain't left an exit
It better get better quick, how you let her get sick with bread invested
In the church every sunday
I've been searchin' for one way
Or another, you're gonna have to curse me or burst me with a sunray
To let me know that you're coming or en route
I'm 'bout ninety-nine, but I need a hundred percent proof
 [Hook]
Show me a God
Ahh
I'm kinda feelin' that it is a facade
Show me a God
Ahh
And if it is, why ain't He doin' His job
Show me a God
Ahh
Even if it's a thing, a man, or a broad
Show me a God, please
Let me know something is listening when I'm down on my knees

[Verse 2]
Where was the Passion of Christ
What happened to passin' his life for the masses
Bad, it ain't happenin' twice
'Cause my mother's stacked in a lab and its stagnant at nights
I need your help, and I'm not askin' it nice
All in life it's been paramedics
All my life comin' up all I heard "Is There A Medic?"
A youngin', all I could do is stare at it 
Seizure after seizure, if I was you
Wouldn't ne'er let it be heredit-tary
If Aar get it, I swear that it's scary
Sittin' in a insane asylum
God or God's Ghost, man I aim to find 'em
To take away all of this angel's pain inside, come rain
If Momma go, how come I can't deny them
And she only fifty-four, in a ward watchin' her war
And it's more blood and gore, and she tore, cuz people are so deceivin'
And I'm on the floor, because with nor Lord this war absorbs more poor
Havin' all the soldiers screamin' 
[Hook]
Show me a God
Ahh
I'm kinda feelin' that it is a facade
Show me a God
Ahh
And if it is, why ain't He doin' His job
Show me a God
Ahh
Even if it's a thing, a man, or a broad
Show me a God, please
Let me know something is listening when I'm down on my knees

[Verse 3]
Think about how all the victims of Katrina feelin'
They need a ceilin', they say that Mother Nature, she the villain
Plead a million, the bible, I read a bllion, Still I'm free to see the real
And my feet are grillin', 'cause hellish heat is buildin' up
Think my momma ain't ill enough? It's killin' us
I will erupt if they're pillin' her false, still ain't no healin' her
I been searchin' for answers, but I find nothin' but man stuff
That puts a damper on the current problem at hand bruh
Or whatever it is, I will never forgive
Anybody who take Marty, better get her to live
She's so sick that it don't matter how much cheddar I give
To the thing or the lady, here's a letter to his
Majesty, why ain't you stoppin' these tragedies
My mother's glad to be with you, but her life's been a raggedy one
What's gonna be done in two thousand twelve when hell's gonna be
When the Earth aligned with the sun

[Hook]
Show me a God
Ahh
I'm kinda feelin' that it is a facade
Show me a God
Ahh
And if it is, why ain't He doin' His job
Show me a God
Ahh
Even if it's a thing, a man, or a broad
Show me a God, please
Let me know something is listening when I'm down on my knees

[Outro]
That's why I be lookin' for ghosts
Or somethin' supernatural. The only thing I know Supernatural, is the rapper
Maybe if I saw something like that it'd make me change my life or somethin'
Now let's get into K.O.D....---Lyrics submitted by sheldon.

I can't breathe anymore
I've gone the distance
Can't see me anymore
The darkness has overcome
I don't wanna be part of this
But I let it take me
So I let it take me
Now it's dripping all over me

We on this Earth as we hell raisers
We crave good life but born into this dead-zone
I've searched for answers from my female maker
In the cemetery but they never produced her headstone

Black as ever like shabba
Thick and oozing like lava
See this room with my Prada, dadda
Must've came from my father
'Cause my momma, was an angel
But this thang grow, insane bro
(Insane woah)
This is darkness accumulated
Over the years the heartless but fools I made it
Over to here on the TV
Cops kill a man 'cause he's trying to buy a BB Gun
(BB Gun)
What's gonna happen when they see me come
Really run
(Really run)
I'm 'bout to just boom
Take the madness
Let it explode and shake the masses
Shroud that I carry here to break the rabbits
And awake the maggots
I hate your habits
(I hate your habits)
Your evil's consuming me
Now my heart and brain together in unity
Darkness...
'Cause ain't no opportunity

They say my metamorphosis made a monster
In so many ways this statement might be true
Your plan right from the start was divide and conquer
So what do you think I see when I see you?

Give me your wishes
Give me your hit-list
Bring all the wicked
I'm 'bout to show you I'm vicious
Ligaments and Sriracha's delicious
No stopping for tickets
Don't make me give the crooked coppers the business
(Coppers the business)
I was suspicious
Wearing your anger
During your danger
Swearing whore wrangler
Don't let me close to y'all
If you touch it it's like an overdose of Propofol
I be the ghost of all
That wanna vote for hogs
I gotta go tomorrow
(Go tomorrow)
Licking my lips, Ow!
Burn my tongue
I need a germ to come through me ...
I lay stagnant
I'm an avid madman
See the evil I grab
It stick to me like a magnet
You can have it
(You can have it)
Rack, I'm a clack on they asses
Brack!
Brack!
Brack!
Give the evil no passes---

Hey, Now everybody sit down and shut the fuck up
Class is now in session
If you came here to hear that lovey dovey shit, Get the fuck out! 
If you soft and scared of hardcore shit, Get the fuck out! 
For those who love raw shit, Welcome to Sickology 101
Your instructor for today is Tech N9ne! 

[Tech N9ne]
This the style
I use pitch to catch and seduce chicks
To signal the true sick
Mellow tone is what you spit
Switchin the pattern
Bust up that quick Midwest chatter
And some people hate but it ain't matterin
But the people gather it's flattering
Switching the pitch, Mixing
There's no need to be stiff in this bitch
Spittin full clips on a mission for bliss
When I be ripping this shit, Make it exciting
Gotta be inviting when you're writing your piece
Never be dick riding
If you're gonna be biting, You're igniting the beast

This is melodic melodies
If you got it, Mix it hot as tamales
You singing off-key is garbage
If you can't keep an octave in a pocket, You need to stop it
Have confidence, Speak with conviction
Don't put 'em asleep when you rock it

This is harmony, N9na's taking you through it
Make it buttery, Utterly beautiful, Make it fluid
Sickology 101 is in session, I thought you knew it
We murderin muthafuckaz in music
That's how we do it

[Chorus]
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Such an oddity with it, This is sickology
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
From our West Coast instructor, Crooked I

[Crooked I]
My killer Dayton's
They keep me crushing the competition
Coming correct when creating the crazy composition
Cannibal character, Calico carrier
Got a crooked coppa missing
Cali killers on candid cock emissions
That was constant cotenant wordplay
Wordplay rhymes with Thursday and thirsty, If I'm thurstay
I change the pronunciation of words, per se
The English language gotta do whatever my verse say

So if you want to learn to rap, This is how (This is how)
Right now I'm putting swag in my style (In my style)
It's a emphasis on the simplest sentences
Then I give 'em charisma with a laugh and a smile (And a smile)
If you want your verses to cost higher
Then your similes gotta be hot as a live wire
You need some better metaphors
For example, 
This song is a war zone and you listeners in the cross fire

[Chorus]
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Such an oddity with it, This is sickology
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
From our East Coast instructor, Chino XL

[Chino XL]
Everybody start locking your windows and doors
Chino might get in
It's like lightning and hounds striking a trifling riflemen
Bullets flying up and I'm numb in the bum, Like it's Vicodin
So much metal in his spine
He could get rich from the recycling
Chino be curdling blood
Don't get burned from the buzz
I speak with conviction
Like when the branch is heard from the judge
Bludgeon no love, Industry hate me
Yo, I'd rather hear Hannah Montana
Than half of you rappers on the radio
Startin drama with Chino, God forbid
Auction my lyrics on eBay, That's God for bid
Problem is lyric Jesus is more than a man with a sick delivery
Like I drive a coroner van

I'm demented, Spitting rhythm's as sick as I can
Grenade gripping, Fitting to detonate Disneyland
I am teaching Sickology
Try to follow how every punch line hits
Like Chris Brown's fist in the face of Rihanna

[Chorus]
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Such an oddity with it, This is Sickology
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Get (on your feet), Up (out your seat)
Yes, I gotta be vicious, This is Sickology

[Outro]
For those who don't know what the fuck's goin on
This is sickology 101
You punk muthafuckaz
Ha, ha, ha
Let's kill these niggaz---Lyrics submitted by Jeremy.

I get to busting like I'm a thirty-aught-six
When I'm rippin' the beat up, but then I heard they got pissed
When I got at the top then made 'em pretty hot
Cause they knowin' that Tecca Ninna's the dirty chop (chopp-er)
He’s handled, Holmes, here’s a handful
How in the hell he hoverin', havin' hell and go ham though
I said to Seven, "Richard Havens'll be the man"
So we put it together thinking Eminem was a gamble
Guess not, cause he be the guest spot
Kaliko said, "what we doin'?," I said to 'im, "let's chop"
So now the people finally get three of the best locked
Never be another choppers comin' so let's rock, nigga
You're on, people got to wondering if it's a for sure song
Yes, I got another killer making a tour strong
If you thinking of battling - you're gone!

Nobody can catch up, meet the Speedy Gonzalez
The beat is the problem
And if ya got your feet in your mouth
You gon' have to beat it up out of him
It's a lot of 'em and I mean a lot of 'em
And me and Nina used to follow them
I’ve got to audibly body them
And this is it man, the hitman, the Ip Man, karate 'em
And the fans will lift hands, we'll be dancin' out of 'em
And in Kansas advanced to withstand a pile of 'em
Who stands with two hands to move in the crowd of 'em
If I ain't makin' sense
Then you better sample the amp of it like the bass
It ain't ever been a given, I heat 'em, I beat 'em, I burn 'em
Then I let 'em out
They never heard of us, but look at me, I'm turnin' up
I slap the shirt off a stupid simpleton to make 'em be impotent
If and when I'm flippin, niggas be feminine
I said the purpose to pick a pen
And reverse the conditions I'm livin' in
And do bigger numbers than Eminem
Gotta be fast so I smash on a nigga
With half the cash I'm a little sicker, quicker than your figure
(Ice cold) I make 'em shiver bigger than the winter
If you half ass delivering I'mma eat your dinner
Better than mine, oh no, not me, I mean other guys
I jump around so do that mean that I'm rubberized?
Me and N9ne master, meaning we murderize
We bleed ‘em, beat 'em, till they be gone, feed 'em

Speedom!
(If you wanna go with us)
Speedom!
(I'mma leave 'em in the dust)
Speedom!
(I must be the one to bust)
Speedom!
(And I'm gonna hit the clutch)

Sometimes, I feel
Like I'll never slow down
Worldwide Choppers

Wait! Before I wreck this beat, let me just check to see
If Stephanie Mills left any extra refills of ecstacy pills next to me
In the seats spilled, or did she eat 'em all with a breakfast drink
(You inspect the sink?)
In the habit of grabbin' a mic and babblin', I dabble in lights
But I might just swallow my fuckin' Ritalin tablet after the night
I'm grabbin' it right from the medicine cabinet
Cause that's what it's like and attack it like a Dracula bite
Jetpack in my backpack when I write
This thing I penned up inside when I went up inside
A Finnegan's diner with a cigarette lighter
Figured I'd try to set a big enough fire
That’ll trigger the sprinkler system
And I'd escape, but the getaway driver screwed up my limo
Collided with the center divider
I went through the window and ended up bein'
Pinned to the side of a semi
Offended beside a friend of the guy’s wife
Friend of the flight attendant from Idaho
That took an antenna in the vagina hole
‘Cause when I pick up a pen I’m venomous
And I’m as thick as Dennis the Menace
Like an evil dental hygienist, sinister
You’ve been yelling dementedness
I invented this, I’m the Genesis
Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist
Fuckin' smart alec degenerate
I got Ellen DeGeneres
Tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy
Envious of female independence
Hell with a clitoris, hit or miss you
Never consider this a bit of disappointment
I'll never fail to deliver this
Whatever the weather in this'll
Be just like a certificate of authenticity
That I’m thinkin’ about
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way for ‘em to picket it
I pick a day to be picked and I’m picking the wickedest shit to say
Spin it back on a level, incredible, head of a rebel, unforgettable
Better believe these beats are edible
I consider loose leaf a vegetable
And I stalk my prey
You think you got away, uh-uh not today
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake
Eatin' lobster, steak and coffee cake
At a restaurant with Drake
And Tech just got to make sure that our stories corroborate
I'm a lot to take like Kanye
Walking up on the stage for Beyonce
Like it’s my job to say
That you’re not a real artist, but it’s my obligation
Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape
Ammunition, replenish the Punisher
With his gun at your hundred words
And a clip on that which motherfuckers better run
If you're not lookin' to get run over by the roadrunner
No wonder no one don't wanna go
And jump in front of a fuckin' runaway locomotive
Or get thrown up under it just tryna fuck with the..

I'm the fury, the final fight
I flip it on fraudulent fellas for feelin' fright
I flick it on fire, finish him when the flow in flight
Feminine fakers fall, I'm floggin' a foe with a fife
Never forget it, I severed the head of a critic
I sped up and did it, you tripping to be a dead epidemic
Or wet up a clinic, and make a bloody redder percentage
Of an addict who’s having to get the lead of a cynic
I was never the Devil, I put up a fight up in the industry
Peddle the metal, we giving the light, a lot of energy
We repping, beat checking he that be Koba
If he's the evil enemy it'll be over
Wanna get down in front of your town
You ever making fun of the clown, I'm gunning you down
We doing it under the ground, a wonderful sound
If anybody come at the hound, don't wanna be found, bitch
Would never be chopping without Slick Rick
I got it from the record, lick the balls and this dick
If you never listen to me, you musical misfit
Nah, cause every time I be dropping I get bit
I'm hearing a lot of rappers, they trying to spit quick
But the Middle West got 'em, and we killing 'em in this bitch
If you ain't in my circle of choppers you missed it
Cause me and my nigga Twista ruler, and that's it---
