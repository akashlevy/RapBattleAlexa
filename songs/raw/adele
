I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before, you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to?

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?

Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?---

Wait, do you see
My heart on my sleeve?
It's been there
For days on end and
It's been waiting for you
To open up
Just you baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words
Roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel a way
You've never felt before
And I'm all you need
And that you never want more
Then you'd say all
Of the right things
Without a clue
But you'd save
The best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know
That you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you
It don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space
That happened to be free
How dare you think
You'd get away
With trying to play me

Why is it everytime
I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
Cause you're still
Not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do
To make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances
And getting away
And though I'm trying
My hardest you back to her
And I think that I know
Things may never change
I'm still hoping one day
I might hear you say

I make you feel a way
You've never felt before
And I'm all you need
And that you never want more
Then you'd say all
Of the right things
Without a clue
But you'd save
The best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know
That you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you
It don't mean that much to me
You're just a filler in the space
That happened to be free
How dare you think
You'd get away
With trying to play me

But, despite
The truth that I know
I find it hard to let go
And give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me
The more eager I am
To persist
With this heartbreak
And running around
And I think that I know
Things may never change
I'm still hoping one day
I might hear you say

I make you feel a way
You've never felt before
And I'm all you need
And that you never want more
And we'll say all
Of the right things
Without a clue
And you'll be the one for me
And me the one for you---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.

I've made up my mind,
Don't need to think it over,
if I'm wrong I am right,
Don't need to look no further,
This ain't lust,
i know this is love, but!

If i tell the world,
I'll never say enough,
Cause it was not said to you,
And thats exactly what i need to do,
If i'm in love with you,

Should i give up?
Or should i just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere,
Or would it be a waste?
Even If i knew my place, should i leave it there?
Should i give up?
Or should i just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere

I'd build myself up,

And fly around in circles,
Wait then as my heart drops,
and my back begins to tingle
finally could this be, it ah

Should i give up?
Or should i just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere,
Or would it be a waste?
Even If i knew my place, should i leave it there?
Should i give up?
Or should i just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere 

yeaaa
(talking/singing)
Should i give up?
Or should i just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere,
Or would it be a waste?
Even If i knew my place, should i leave it there?
Should i give up?
Or should i just keep on chasing pavements?
should i just keep on chasing pavements?

ohhhhhhh

should i give up?
or should i just keep chasing pavements?
even if it leads nowhere,
or would it be a waste?
even if i knew my place,should i leave it there?

even if it, leads nowhere.---Lyrics submitted by alexis.

You say it's all in my head
And the things I think
Just don't make sense
So where you been then?
Don't go all coy
Don't turn it 'round on me
Like it's my fault

See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shotts me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with workds made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her

These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it and you're not satisfied

You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too when

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at m e and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her

Time and time again I play the role of fool
Just for you
And even in the daylight when your gaming
I don't see through
I try to look for thing I hear
But my eyes never find

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her---Lyrics submitted by mika.

Found myself today singing out your name,
you said I'm crazy,
if I am I'm crazy for you.

Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
turns me crazy,
but it's you who makes me lose my head.

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
you drift into my head
and turn me into a crumbling fool.

Tell me to run and I'll race,
if you want me to stop I'll freeze,
and if you are me gonna leave, just hold me closer baby,
and make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you.

Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
send me spinning closer to you.

My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
strips me down bare
and gets me into my favourite mood.

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
but the more I do,
the crazier I turn into.

Pacing floors and opening doors,
hoping you'll walk through
and save me boy,
because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.

Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
And making up the past
Feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before

A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh

You can find him sittin' on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through

There's no way I
Could describe him
What I'll say is
Just what I'm hoping for

But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life---

When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any sins
I had no idea of the state we were in

I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and heaviness in my head

But don't you remember? Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong
the more I do, The less I know

But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness,
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head

But don't you remember? Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

I gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
And hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

Why don't you remember? Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more

When will I see you again?---

So little to say
But so much time
Ddespite my empty mouth
The words are in my mind
Please wear the face
The one where you smile
Because you
Lighten up my heart
When I start to cry

Forgive me first love
But I'm tired
I need to get away
To feel again
Try to understand why
Don't get so close
To change my mind
Please wipe that look
Out of your eyes
It's bribing me
To doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring

This love has dried up
And stayed behind
And if I stay
I'll be alive
Then choke on words
I'd always hide
Excuse me first love
But we're through
I need to taste the kiss
From someone knew

Forgive me first love
But I'm too tired
I'm bored to say
The least and I
I lack desire
Forgive me first love (4x)
Forgive me
Forgive me first love (2x)---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.

Some say I'll be better without you
But they don't know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew

I can't beg this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you left behind

Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity's become undone

But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb?
I won't forgive me if I give up trying

I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vacant broken boy instead

But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I am willing to take the risk

There will be times
We'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We'll almost fall apart then burn the pieces
To watch them turn to dust
But nothing will ever taint us

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I am willing to take the risk

Will he... will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free?
Or will he go back to the place where he would choose the poison over me?

When we spoke yesterday,
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait
"I'll be home so soon, I won't be late"

He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk

So I won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk

I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk---

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore, ooooohh
Anymore, ooooohh
Anymore, ooooohh
Anymore, anymore

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore---

I've been walking
In the same way as I did
Missing out
The cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel
And strutting my feet
"Is there anything
I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone I can call?"
"No and thank you, please Madam
I ain't lost, just wandering"

Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh, the people I've met

Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world

I like it in the city
When the air
Is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody
In short skirts
Shorts and shades
I like it in the city
When two worlds collide
You get the people
And the government
Everybody taking
Different sides

Shows that
We ain't gonna stand shit
Shows
That we are united
Shows
That we ain't gonna take it
Shows
That we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met

Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.

Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me closely
Don't patronize
Don't patronize me

Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Somethin' that it won't
And here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
And I will feel the power but you won't
No you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me
When you don't
When you don't

I'll close my eyes
'Cause then I won't see
The love you don't feel
When you're home with me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight
And I will give up this fight---

I thought I told you, he'd be home soon
Couldn't help myself, you're too good to be true.
I fall short each time,
Every time he ain't here
You and your charm creep closer
Closer and near
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all.
Like a bomb before explosion,
Ticking by your call,
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed,
And I'm just a child who belongs on her knees.

But I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried,
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you.

So, you thought that I'd crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper "will you leave your man? "
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me.
I won't stand by you.

Cause I found a boy who I love more,
Than I ever did you before,
So stand beside the river I cried
And lay yourself down.
Look how you want me now that I don't need you!

I ain't yours for no taking,
You must be mistaken
I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong
And ignore the right

When I found a boy who loves me more,
Than you ever did me before.

I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your oceans too
Treat me soft but touch me cruel
I wanna teach you things you never knew, ooh baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
And kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me

Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light

I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do
Baby you bring your heart, I'll bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone

Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light

We play so dirty in the dark
Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby
Harder baby, harder baby

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light

I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you---

Hold me closer one more time,
Say that you love me in your last goodbye,
Please forgive me for my sins,
Yes, I swam dirty waters,
But you pushed me in,
I've seen your face under every sky,
Over every border and on every line,
You know my heart more than I do,
We were the greatest, me and you,

But we had time against us,
Miles between us,
The heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue,
And I see my future in you,

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I'll put my hands up,
I'll do everything different,
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I'll put my hands up,
I'll be somebody different,
I'll be better to you,

Let me stay here for just one more night,
Build your world around me,
And pull me to the light,
So I can tell you that I was wrong,
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn,

But we had time against us,
Miles between us,
The heavens cried,

I know I left you speechless,
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue,

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,

I'll be somebody different,
I'll be better to you,

Time against us,
Miles between us,
Heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
Time against us,
Miles between us,
Heavens cried,
I know I left you speechless,
I know I left you speechless,
I'll be waiting,

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I'll put my hands up,
I'll do everything different,
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again,
I'll put my hands up,
I'll be somebody different,

Take your eyes off me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changing

You have given me something I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changing

We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to mean
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive

That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me---

[Verse 1:]
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

[Chorus:]
However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you

[Verse 2:]
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again

[Chorus:]
However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you

However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you

I'll always love you
I'll always love you
Cause I love you
Love, love, love...---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.

When the rain is flowing in your face,
And the whole world is on your case,
I could offer you a warm embrace,
To make you feel my love.

When the evening  shadows and the stars appear,
And there is no one there to dry your tears,
I could hold you for a million years,
To make you feel my love.

I know you haven’t made your mind up yet,
But I would never do you wrong,
I’ve known it from the moment that we met,
No doubt in my mind that you belong.

I’d go hungry; I’d go black and blue,
I’ll go crawling down the avenue,
So there’s nothing that I wouldn’t do,
To make you feel my love

Instrumental

The storms are raging on the rolling sea,
And on the highway over there,
The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
You ain’t seen nothing like me yet.

I could make you happy make your dreams come true,
Nothing that I wouldn’t do,
Go to the ends of the earth for you,
To make you feel my love.
To make you feel my love.---Lyrics submitted by Ilse.

Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me dead

I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love
I'm the only one in love---

Right under my feet
There's air
Made of bricks
Pulls me down
Turns me weak
For you
I find myself
Repeating like
A broken tune
And I'm forever
Excusing
Your intentions
And I give in
To my pretendings
Which forgive you
Each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart
To stone

[Chorus:]
And I hear your words
That I made up
You say my name
Like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head
I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time
I turn around to leave
I feel my heart
Begin to burst
And bleed
So desperately
I try to link it
With my head
But instead
I fall back
To my knees
As you tear your way
Right through me
I forgive you
Once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt
My heart to stone

(Chorus)

Why do you
Steal my hand
Whenever
I'm standing
My own ground
You build me up
Then leave me dead

Well

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.

I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That is would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can spend the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother; I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago---

You said I'm stubborn
And I never give in
I think you're stubborn
'Cept you're always softening
You say I'm selfish
I agree with you on that
I think you're giving out
In way too much in fact
I say we've only known
Each other one year

You say I've known
You longer my dear
You like to be so close
I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs
And you prefer the floor
Walking with each other
Think we'll never
Match at all
But we do (4x)

I thought I knew myself
Somehow you know me more
I've never known this
Never before
You're the first
To make out
Whenever we are two
I don't know who I'd be
If I didn't know you
You're so provocative
I'm so conservative
You're so adventurous
I'm so very cautious
Combining
You think
We would and we do
But we do (3x)

Favouritism
Ain't my thing
But in this situation
I'll be glad

Favouritism
Ain't my thing
But in this situation
I'll be glad
To make an exception

Picture perfect memories,
Scattered all around the floor.
Reaching for the phone 'cause
I can't fight it anymore.
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time.

It's a quarter after one,
I'm all alone and I need you now.
Said I wouldn't call
but I lost all control and I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without,
I just need you now.

Another shot of whisky,
can't stop looking at the door.
Wishing you'd come sweeping
in the way you did before.
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.
For me it happens all the time.

It's a quarter after one,
I'm a little drunk,
And I need you now.
Said I wouldn't call
but I lost all control and I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without,
I just need you now.

oh ohhh...

Yes, I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all.
It's a quarter after one,
I'm all alone and I need you now.
And I said I wouldn't call
but I'm a little drunk and I need you now.
And I don't know how I can do without,
I just need you now,
I just need you now.
Oh, baby I need you now.---Lyrics submitted by Meh ran.

I know sometimes you're scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
There's something new inside my heart
And it cries like a child whenever we're apart
I've seen your face under every sky
I find the less I look, more I find

So let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
You're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
You know I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want

You know sometimes that I'm scared of the dark
But I'm feeling so brave when I'm in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
You hold me upright
When I'm sure of falling

So let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want

There will be times
When we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt devil
Almost fall apart then burn to pieces
And we'll watch them turn to dust
But without each other, nothing is seizing us

So let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want
Let's go back there, back to the start
Swear I'm never gonna leave you
Cause you're the only one I want, yeah
You're the only one
Never gonna leave no
No, I'm never gonna leave you, no---

Sometimes the hole
You left hurts my heart
So bad it cuts through
The deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth
With words that I cry
How I'm still trying
To stay inside

Hearts break
And hearts wait
To make us
Grow from dust
Then our eyes cry
And souls sigh
So that we know
That it hurts
Our hearts break
And hearts wait
To make us
Grow from dust
Then our eyes cry
And souls sigh
So that we know
That it hurts

Every now and then
My memories ache
With the empty ideas
Of the ones we'd made
But as time goes on
And my age gets older
I love the ones I know
They're enough
To picture the rain

Cause heart break
And hearts wait
To make us
Grow from dust
Then our eyes cry
And souls sigh
So that we know
That it hurts
Our hearts break
And hearts wait
To make us
Grow from dust
Then our eyes cry
And souls sigh
So that we know
That it hurts

You know
When to make me
I might

You've been on my mind, I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me so long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I want

I don't know why I'm scared, I've been here before
Every feeling, every word, I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
Promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me a chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

Have I've been on your mind, do you hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time at the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me whichever road I choose you'll go

I don't know why I'm scared 'cause I've been here before
Every feeling, every word, I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
Promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me a chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart

Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me, I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me, I've learned it

Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me, I've learned it
Nobody's perfect
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Trust me I've learned it

So I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me a chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

Come on and give me a chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts---

Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life
Ooh

Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me
I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel
Leave

I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
So scratch my itch and beat my drum
So i can start to begin what's begun

Filling up my heart with golden stories

Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up

So I can finish what has begun

I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breath
Right before my eyes I saw, my heart it came to life
This ain't easy it's not meant to be
Every story has it's scars

When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy

No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whenever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you

When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy

When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
I will be, I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be, I will be...

Who wants to be right as rain
It's better
When something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes
And your all on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who want to be right as rain
It's harder when your on top

Cause when hard work
Don't pay off
And I'm tired
There aint no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now
I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble
Back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least
When your at your worst
You know how to feel things

See when hard work
Don't pay off
And I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now
I've had enough of love

Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
When we were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game

Cause who wants
To be right as rain
It's better
When something is wrong
I get excitement
In your bones
Even thought
Everything's a strain
When night comes
And I'm all on my own
You should know
I chose to be alone
So who want to be
Right as rain
It's harder
When your on top

Cause when hard work
Don't pay off
And I'm tired

So wipe that dirty smile off

You should know
I chose to be alone
So who want to be
Right as rain
It's harder
When your on top

Cause when hard work
Don't pay off
And I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won’t be making up
I’ve cried my heart out
And now
I've had enough of love---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.

Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back, but the reeves are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Oh, It's in my roots, in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain

So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No I can't go back, but the reeves are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Oh, It's in my roots, in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain

So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

River Lea, River Lea
River Lea, River Lea
River Lea, River Lea
River Lea, River Lea
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea
The River Lea-Lea-Lea-Lea---

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship [shit] bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure won't be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it, to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it, with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door (woah)
Count your blessings to find what you look for (woah)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (woah)
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (woah)
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)

But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat. ---Lyrics submitted by rosemarie.

There’s a fire starting in my heart

Baby I have no story to be told
But I’ve heard one of you
And I’m gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there
It Reminds you of the home we shared

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can’t help feeling

We could have had it all

She, she ain't real,
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will,
She is a stranger,
You and I have history,
Or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all,
But, baby, is that really what you want?

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds,
She made a fool out of you,
And, boy, she's bringing you down,
She made your heart melt,
But you're cold to the core,
Now rumour has it she ain't got your love anymore,

Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,

She, is half your age,
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you've stayed,
I heard you've been missing me,
You've been telling people things you shouldn't be,
Like when we creep out and she ain't around,
Haven't you heard the rumours?

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds,
You made a fool out of me,
And, boy, I'm bringing me down,
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core,
But rumour has it I'm the one you're leaving her for,

Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,

All of these words whispered in my ear,
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear,
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it,
People say crazy things,
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it,
Just 'cause you heard it,

Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,
Rumour has it, rumour,

But rumour has it he's the one I'm leaving you for.---Lyrics submitted by Nop.

Just the guitar pick

This was all, none of it me
You put your hands all over my body and told me
You told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I be your last love everlasting you and me
That was what you told me

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

I was too strong you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising)
Baby I'm so rising
I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down)
Mmm there's only one way down

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, I am ready
If you're ready, if you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
No, we ain't kids no more

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

If you're ready, if you're ready (Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
If you're ready, if you're ready (Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more---

I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak,
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew.
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true,
And the games you play
You would always win, always win.

But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together
Nothing gets better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew,
All the things you'd say,
They were never true, never true,
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win.

But I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name!

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time!

Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you.

I set fire to the rain,
Watched it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name

I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time, ohhhh!

Oh noooo
Let it burn, oh
Let it burn
Let it burn---

This is the end
Hold your breath
And count to ten
Feel the earth move
And then
Hear my heart burst again

For this is the end
I’ve drowned and dreamt
This moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away
I’m stolen

Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall

Skyfall
Is where we start
A thousand miles
And poles apart
Where worlds collide
And days are dark
You may have my number
You can take my name
But you’ll never have my heart

Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I’d never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we’ll stand

Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the skyfall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall

Let the skyfall
We will stand tall
At skyfall ---Lyrics submitted by Joanna Hill.

I heard that your settled down.
That you found a girl and your married now.
I heard that your dreams came true.
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.

Old friend, why are you so shy?
It ain't like you to hold back or hide from the lie.

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited,
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I hoped you'd see my face & that you'd be reminded,
That for me, it isn't over.

Nevermind, I'll find someone like you.
I wish nothing but the best for you too.
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said:-
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah.

You'd know how the time flies.
Only yesterday was the time of our lives.
We were born and raised in a summery haze.
Bound by the surprise of our glory days.

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited,
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
I hoped you'd see my face & that you'd be reminded,
That for me, it isn't over yet.

Nevermind, I'll find someone like you.
I wish nothing but the best for you too.
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said:-
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, yay-e.

Nothing compares, no worries or cares.
Regret's and mistakes they're memories made.
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

Nevermind, I'll find someone like you.
I wish nothing but the best for you too.
Don't forget me, I beg, I remembered you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Nevermind, I'll find someone like you.
I wish nothing but the best for you too.
Don't forget me, I beg, I remembered you said:-
"Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah.---Lyrics submitted by Harley.

With your loving, there ain't nothing
That I can't adore
The way I'm running, with you, honey
Is we can break every low
I find it funny that you're the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls

I wasn't ready then; I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known

I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone

I wasn't ready then; I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known

I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
All my life, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
And you're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope, everything, everywhere

The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known

Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Devotion---

Didn't I give it all,
Tried my best,
Gave you everything I had,
Everything and no less?
Didn't I do it right?
Did I let you down?

Maybe you got too used to
Well, having me around.
Still how can you walk away
From all my tears?
It's gonna be an empty road
Without me right here.

But go on and take it,
Take it all with you.
Don't look back
At this crumbling fool.
Just take it all
With my love,
Take it all
With my love.

Maybe I should leave
To help you see
Nothing is better than this
And this is everything we need.
So is it over?
Is this really it?
You've given up so easily,
I thought you loved me more than this.

But go on, go on and take it,
Take it all with you.
Don't look back
At this crumbling fool.
Just take it all
With my love,
Take it all
With my love.

I will change if I must.
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust.
Oh if only, if only you knew,
Everything I do is for you.

But go on
Go on and take it,
Take it all with you.
Don't look back
At this crumbling fool.
Just take it,
Take it all with you.
Don't look back
At this crumbling fool.
Just take it all
With my love,
Take it all
With my love
Take it all
With my love.---

When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on

The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
To hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh

You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby, I can take a lot
Cause I love
Eerything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me

Hold my hand
While you cut me down
It had only just begun
But now it's over now
And your
In the heat of moments
With your heart
Playing up cold
I'm between the middle
Watching hastiness unfold
In my eyes
Your were smiling
In the spotlight dancing
With the night
The night fell
Off your mind

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When i dont get nothing back
And for and for and for
When i don't get nothing back
Boy, i'm tired

Where'd you go
When you stay behind
I looked up and inside down
And outside only to find
A double taking punching hard
And laughing at my smile
I get closer you
Obviously prefer her

Chorus:
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When i don't get nothing back
And for and for and for
When i dont get nothing back
Boy, i'm tired of trying
Your teasing aint enough
Fed up of biding your time
When i don't get nothing back
And for and for and for
When i don't get nothing back
Boy, i'm tired

(I should have known)

Never mind said
Your open arms
I couldn't help
Belive the trick me
Back into them

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.

Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

Under haunted skies I see you oh
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you, what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
Turning tables

Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own savior
When the thunder calls for me
Next time I'll be braver
I'll be my own savior
Standing on my own two feet

I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you, what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables
Turning tables, yeah
Turning oh---

If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through

It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge---

Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Cause nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swore you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
I'm so mad I'm getting old
It makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young---

In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish I'd said
At the dawning of the day
I can't bare to see the light
I make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left

I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own

You'll never see me again
I'll be back in time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive
You'll never see me again

At the dawning of the day
I can't bare to see the light
I make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness you've left

I can't drown in your tears
I won't face your fears
I need to fight my own

You'll never see me again
I'll be back in time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive

Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you life goes on
You'll never see me again
I've been learning to live without you now
It's taken all of my strength
But I'm stronger now

You'll never see me again
I'll be back in time
Let the waves take me under
I know I'll survive

Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again
You'll never see me again ---
