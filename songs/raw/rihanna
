Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen
American oxygen
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen

I say, you see, this is the American Dream
Young girl, hustlin'
On the other side of the ocean
She can be anything at all
America, America..
I say, come see
Just close your eyes and breathe

Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen

You say, you see, this is the American Dream
Young boy, hustlin'
Tryna get the wheels in motion
But he can be anything at all
America, America...
I say, can't see
Just close your eyes and breathe

Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen
Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen

This is the new America
We are the new America

Breathe out, breathe in

Every breath I breathe
Chasin' this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire

There could be a freak accident
There could be a fatal disease
I know we hate to think about it
But this as real as you and me
This as real as you and me

We could all fall down
Before our Saviour could return
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me

If I should go
Hold my hand
If I should leave
Darling cover me, please

The earth could quake to ruin
We could drift off in our sleep
I know we hate to think about it
But this as real as you and me
This as real as you and me

The ocean crushed the shore
And take us down forevermore
I know we hate to think about it
But this as real as you and me

I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
It's as real as you and me---

Come and put your name on it
Put your name on it
Come and put your name on it
Your name
Bet you wanna put your name on it
Put your name on it
Come and put your name on it
Ba-ba-baby

It's not even my birthday
But he want to lick the icing off
I know you want it in the worst way
Can't wait to blow my candles out

He want that cake, cake,
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake

Ooh baby, I like it
You so excited
Don't try to hide it
I'mma make you my bitch
Cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake
Cake, cake, cake

I know you wanna bite this
Its so enticin'
Nothin' else like this
I'mma make you my bitch

And it's not even my birthday
But you wanna put your name on it
And it's not even my birthday
And he tryna put his name on it
Oooh, I wanna fuck you right now
Just get up on my body... ---Lyrics submitted by Armani DavaSha.

Chest to chest. 
Nose to Nose.
Palm to palm. 

We were always just that close. 
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose. 

So how come when i reach out my finger. 
It feels like more then distance between us.

In this california king bed. We're ten thousand miles apart. 
I been california wishing on these stars for your heart, for me. My california king.

Eye to eye, cheek to cheek, side by side. 
You were sleeping next to me. 
Arm in arm, dusk to dawn. 
With the curtains drawn.
And a little last night on these sheets.

So how come when i reach out my fingers. 
It feels like more then distance between us..........
In this california king bed. We're ten thousand miles apart. 
I been california wishing on these stars for your heart, for me. My california king.

Just when i felt like giving up on us. 
You turned around and give me one last touch.
That made everything feel better.
And even then my eyes got wetter.
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But i don't wanna seems so weak.
Maybe I've been california dreaming.

In this california king bed. We're ten thousand miles apart. 
I've been california wishing on these stars for your heart, for me. My california king.

My california king. 

In this california king bed. We're ten thousand miles apart. 
I been california wishing on these stars for your heart, for me. My california king.---Lyrics submitted by angelina.

Nothing but a tear, that's all for breakfast
Watching you pretend you're unaffected
You're pulling our connections, expecting me to let you go
But I won't

No you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I look in your direction, hoping that the message goes

Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they heard you, you wouldn't find out
Just say now, I'm coming right now, to be close to you

Said you let it go, you kept it
Working hard to perfect it
Now your fear is reckless, and it's out of your control
Would you let it go?

No you don't need my protection
But I'm in love, can't blame me for checking
I look in your direction, hoping that the message goes

Somewhere close to you
Close to you
Like so close if they heard you, you wouldn't find out
If you let me, I'd be there by now
Close to you---

On my roof
Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof
I'm torn apart & you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold Case Love
And I let you reach me one more time
But that's enough

Hook:
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So pick me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall
Truth was there all along
Tell me how did we miss it

Chorus:
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures & white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

2nd Verse:
Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes
Couldn't see (no)
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind you can keep
Release me now cause I did my time
Of this cold case love
My heart's no longer cold & confined
I've had enough

Hook:
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So pick me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall
Truth was there all along
Tell me how did we miss it

Chorus:
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures & white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

Bridge:
We lost our way
Took this too far
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart
We've lost enough
Looking for a truth
That was here all along

Chorus: (2x)
Cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures & white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures & white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love---Lyrics submitted by Queenie.

You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love (no)
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love (no)

Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you, oh I hate it 
Cause if ya really wanna be alone
I will throw my hands up cause baby I tried
Everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?

Sometimes I get you
Sometimes I don't understand
Sometimes I love you
Sometimes it's you I can't stand
Sometimes I wanna hug you
Sometimes I wanna push you away
Most times I wanna kiss you
Other times... punch you in the face

Cause every minute you start switching up
And you say things like you don't give a f-ck
Then I say I'm through with you
Take my heart from you
And you come runnin after me and baby I'm back with you

Oh
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love (no)
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love (no)

Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you, oh I hate it 
Cause if ya really wanna be alone
I will throw my hands up cause baby I tried
Everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?

Sometimes I catch you
Sometimes you get away
Sometimes I read you
Other times I'm like where are you on the page?
Sometimes I feel like we will be together forever
But you're so complicated
My heart knows better

Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you, oh I hate it 
Cause if ya really wanna be alone
I will throw my hands up cause baby I tried
Everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?

I'ma stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure that you're really sure you like sleeping alone
(x2)

Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you, oh I hate it 
Cause if ya really wanna be alone
I will throw my hands up cause baby I tried
Everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?

I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cos I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don’t get deep to me
Never got the whole in love thing
And someone can say they loved me truly
But at the time it didnt mean a thing

My mind is gone
I’m spinning round
And deep inside
My tears ill drown
I’m loosing grip
What’s happening?
I stray from love
This is how I feel

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I’m in this condition
And I got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what
You’ll never see me cry

Did it happen when we first kissed?
Cos it’s hurting me to let it go
Maybe cos we spent so much time
And I know that is no more
I should have never let you hold me baby
Maybe why im sad to see us apart
I didn’t give it to you on purpose
can't figure out how you stole my heart

My mind is gone
I’m spinning round
And deep inside
My tears ill drown
I’m loosing grip
What’s happening?
I stray from love

This is how I feel

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I’m in this condition
And I got all the symptoms

But no matter what
You’ll never see me cry

How did I get here with you
I’ll never know
I never meant to let it get so personal
And after all I tried to do
To stay away from love with you
I’m broken-hearted
I can’t let you know
And I Won’t Let It Show
You won’t see me cry

This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife

This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now i'm, in this condition
And i've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

Chorus:
This time was different
Felt like, I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now i'm, in this condition
And i've, got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what you'll never see me cry

All my life...---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.

Come on

I wanna dance in the dark
Come on
We're gonna light up the night
Come on
I wanna dance in the dark
Come on
We're gonna light up the night

Underdogs dance in the middle of the night
Can see the night skies in the mirror of your eyes
If you don't dance, make sure you got the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm

I wanna run wild in the middle of the night
Right under the moon, bodies glowing in the night
Nothing in between our skins but the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm

The night time is the right time

I wanna dance in the dark
And never stop
We're gonna light up the night
Like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound
Don't be alarmed
Oh, oh, oh, dancing in the dark

Underdogs dance in the middle of the night
Out here with the stars like the creatures of the night
If you don't dance, make sure you got the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm---

Desperado
Sitting in a old Monte Carlo
A man whose heart is hollow
Uh huh, take it easy
I’m not tryna go against you
Actually, I’m going with you

Gotta get up out of here
And you ain’t leaving me behind
I know you won't, cause we share common interests
You need me, there ain’t no leaving me behind
Never know, no, just want out of here
Yeah, once we're gone, ain’t no going back

If you want, take a peek and run away
Running from and it’s out of luck
Yeah, yeah, there ain’t nothing
There ain’t nothing here for me
There ain’t nothing here for me anymore
But I don’t wanna be alone

Desperado
Sitting in an old Monte Carlo
We've both had our hearts broken
Take it easy
I'm not trying to go against you
I can be a lone wolf fishing

Gotta get up out of here
And you ain’t leaving me behind
I know you won't, cause we share common interests
You need me, there ain’t no leaving me behind
Never know, no, both flying out of here
Yeah, once we're gone, ain’t no going back

If you want, we could be runaways
Running from and it’s out of luck
Yeah, yeah, there ain’t nothing
There ain’t nothing here for me
There ain’t nothing here for me anymore
I don’t wanna be alone

Dear desperado
Yeah I don’t wanna be alone
Dear desperado
Yeah I don’t wanna be alone

If you want, we could be runaways
Running from and it’s out of luck
Yeah, yeah, there ain’t nothing
There ain’t nothing here for me
There ain’t nothing here for me anymore
But I don’t wanna be alone---

Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

Find light in the beautiful sea
I choose to be happy
You and I, you and I
We’re like diamonds in the sky

You’re a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I’m alive
We’re like diamonds in the sky

I knew that we’d become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

So shine bright tonight, you and I
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky

Shine bright like a diamond

Feel the warmth, we’ll never die
We’re like diamonds in the sky

A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I’m alive
We’re like diamonds in the sky


At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays

What's wrong with me?
Why do I feel like this?
I'm going crazy now

No more gas, in the rig, can't even get it started
Nothing heard, nothing said, can't even speak about it
On my life, on my head, don't wanna think about it
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah

It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind, it can control you
It's too close for comfort

Put on your pretty lies, you're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice, watch out you might just go under
Better think twice, your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise

Your mind's in disturbia, it's like the darkness is light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia, ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia

Faded pictures on the wall, it's like they talking to me
Disconnecting on calls, the phone don't even ring
I gotta get out or figure this sh** out
It's too close for comfort, oh

It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
It can creep up inside you and consume you
A disease of the mind it can control you
I feel like a monster, oh

Put on your pretty lies, you're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice, watch out you might just go under
Better think twice, your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise

Your mind's in disturbia, it's like the darkness is light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia, ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia, disturbia

Release me from this curse I'm in
Trying to maintain but I'm struggling
If you can't go-o-o
I think I'm gonna ah, ah, ah, ah

Put on your pretty lies, you're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice, watch out you might just go under
Better think twice, your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise

Disturbia, it's like the darkness is light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?

You say you love me
But they feel
Like words to me
Well this just
Ain't working
Stop thinking
You can run over me
Drifting
Settling
Off to
A foreign place
If I can't see
What's in front of me
It's a mystery
Well then apparently

[Chorus:]
Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, begone, bye bye, so long
Can't you see that you're
Fading, fading, fading, fading
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes, and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

Put a sock in it
Just stop running your mouth
Got my mind made up
I ain't coming back again
No way, no way, no way, no way
Cause I'm so fed up
You got me messed up
If we hooking back up
Don't press your luck today, today
I'm blowing you away

[Chorus:]
Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for a change
Go on, begone, ta ta, so long
Can't you see that you're
Fading, fading, fading, fading
Away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
You're fading away

Saw you turn into a ghost right in front of my eyes
Tell me what's a girl to do when she's crying inside?
I'm about to go insane, I'm jumping off this train
Whether wrong or right I'll be gone by night

[Chorus:]
Can't you see that you're

Away, away, away, away

Wherever you're going
I wanna go
Wherever you're heading
Can you let me know
I don't mind catching up
I'm on my way
Just can't take the thought of you miles away

And I know you’re going somewhere to make a better life
I hope that you find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know it'll be sadder
If you never hit the road
So farewell!

[Chorus]
Somebody is gonna miss you
Farewell
Somebody is gonna wish that you were here
That somebody is me

[Rihanna]
I will write to tell you what's going on
But you won't miss nothing but the same old song
If you don't mind catching up
I'll spend the day telling you stories about a land far away
But I know

And I know you’re going somewhere to make a better life
I hope that you find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know it'll be sadder
If you never hit the road
So farewell!

[Chorus]
Somebody is gonna miss you
Farewell
Somebody is gonna wish that you were here
Farewell
Somebody is gonna miss you
Farewell
Somebody is gonna wish that you were here
That somebody is me

[Bridge]
And I'm gon' try to hold it all in
Try to hold back my tears
So it don't make you stay here
I'mma try to be a big girl now
Cause I don't wanna be the reason you don't leave
Farewell

[Chorus]
Somebody is gonna miss you
Farewell
Somebody is gonna wish that you were here
Farewell
Somebody is gonna miss you

Somebody is gonna wish that you were here

I never should have waited so long to say
What i've always known since the very first day 
Thought that you would stya forever with me 
But the time have come too leave

Before we turn off da lights & close our eyes
I'll tell u a secret, i've held all my life 
Its you that i live for & for you I die 
So i'll lay here with you, till the final goodbye

Hold, draw me close, close to my lips 
Listen intently, as i tell you this 
Outside the world wages its wars 
I'll rest in peace as long as you know 

Before we turn out the lights & close our eyes 
I'll tell you a secret, I've held all my life 
It's you that i live for & for you i die 
So i'll lay here with you, till the final goodbye

Promise you our love will carry on 
Until you turn eternal, we belong

Before we turn out the lights & close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret, I've held all my life
It's you that i live for & for you i die 
So i'll lay here with you, till the final goodbye, goodbye---Lyrics submitted by RIGOBERTO.

Yeah 
Whoa 
Gunfire left a hole 
in the tank 
losing gasoline

Fire is on my trail 
And he’s after me 
Hope it don’t get here 
Before I get where I’m going 
I gotta get where I’m going 
Take off my mask to breath 

You could’ve been a apart of a 
Masterpiece 
Fluid in the breaks 
Was the last to leak
That’s the thing 

Where I'm going 
I don’t need my breaks 
Cant wait to see your face 
When your front windows break 
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road 
Oh, oh, oh 
Cause this thing is ready to blow 
Oh, oh, oh 

I just wanna set you on fire 
So I don’t have to burn alone 
Then you 
Then you’ll know where 
I'm coming from 
Fire bomb 
Fire bomb 

Seats go 
But baby no 
Doesn’t have to be 
Like the way that I'm at 
A tragedy 
Watching it burning 
Its beautiful and its blue 
And its pitiful
And its blue as the other half of me
Its the other half of me

I didn’t do it 
You lit the match from me 
Now were flying 
From the blast, baby 
That’s the thing 

Where we're going 
We don’t need no breaks 
Cant wait to see your face 
When your front windows break 
And I come crashing through 

The lovers need to clear the road 
Oh, oh, oh

So I don’t have to burn alone 
Then you 
Then you’ll know where 
I’m coming from 
Fire bomb 
Fire bomb

Baby we were killing them 
They couldn’t handle the millionth degree 
We were criminals 
As we were burning 
The world called the police 
Fire department, ambulance 
You can call me crazy cause I believe 
The only move for me and you 
Is to blow our flames 
And 

The lovers need to clear the road 
Oh, oh, oh 
Cause this thing is ready to blow 
Oh, oh, oh

How could you be so hood, but you so fucking pop?
How could you be so fun, and sound like you selling rocks?

What's in the chain dollars?
What's on my chain dollars?
All of the bank dollars got change for small dollars
Everything plain dollars
I was in the back line, I'm standing in the bank line,
You throwin' up the gang signs

We stay moving around, solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (don't care)
All we know is we was at home cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim

Patron on brain, ball play you in the face
They shake the spot, she's just another case

[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone (gone)
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

He's staying with a flock of them, oh, yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care (won't care)
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non stop its
Getting out of control
Finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend

[Chorus]

We stay moving around, solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care (don't care)
All we know is we was at home cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone

Looked like me and two of my boys playing casino 
Trying to sell they peeping my bag they can't afford it 
Tell 'em to give me back my swag 
They tryin' to clone me 

See my Louis tux, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt 
What that make me 
Louis mane?

Cardiac arrest, cardiac a wrist

As much I love ya
as much I need ya

Most everything you do
make me wana smile
can and I like ya for awile
but you want let me 
you upset me girl 
and then you kiss my lips 
all of a sudden I forget 
that I was upset 
cant remember what you did 
but I hate it 
you know exactly what to do 
so that I cant stay mad at you 
for too long that’s wrong 
but I hate it 
you know exactly how to touch 
so that I don’t wana  fall to fight no more 
so I despise that I adore you

And I hate how much I love you boy 
I cant stand how much I need ya 
and I hate how much I love you boy 
but I just cant let you go 
and I hate that I love you so

And you completely know 
the power that you have 
the only one that makes me laugh 
and its not fair 
how you take advantage of 
the fact that I 
love you beyond a reason why 
and it just aint right

And I hate how much I love you girl 
I cant stand how much I need you 
and I hate how much I love you girl 
but I just cant let you go 
but I hate that I love you so 

one of these days 
maybe your magic wont effect me 
and your kiss wont make me weak 
but no one in this world 
knows me the way you know me 
so you’ll probably always have a spell on me

Tell me that you love me when you know you don't love me
But I guess I guess I guess it's all good
You can play the game, I'ma still do my thing
Ain't no better way for it to be put
When you fuck them other girls I bet they be wondering
Why you always call my name
You think I'm gonna wait around
I ain't got all day

You don't need another lover
Don't you let it go
I already got it covered,
Let the others know

If you want it let's do it
Riding my pony,
My saddle is waitin',
Come and, jump on it
If you want it let's do it
Riding my pony,
My saddle is waitin',
Come and, jump on it

Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump...

Think I give a damn, boy don't you know who I am?
I ain't running around chasing no dude
Think somebody else like me gon' come around
Boy you got it misunderstood
Put it in your face but you're actin' all scared
Like you can't recognize a good thing
Now that you got a chance
Tell me what it's gon' be?

You don't need another lover
Don't you let it go
I already got it covered,
Let the others know

If you want it let's do it
Riding my pony,

You say it's my fault, OK I get it
You ain't pick up your calls, I'm like forget it
See you put up your wall, you know you did it,
The rise and the fall, just admit it
You say it's my fault, OK I get it
You ain't answer your calls, I'm like forget it
It's the the rise and the fall
It's the the rise and the fall
And you could've had it all

If you want it let's do it
Riding my pony,
My saddle is waitin',
Come and, jump on it

Here we are
Mid-air off of the cliff
Staring down at the end again
But then again
Maybe we're finally on
The road that's headed away
From all your complaining
Of hearing the same song
But babe you won't hear it when i'm gone

and It's time to turn on
The Last Song
The Last Song

What if you wasted love and all of our time disappeared ?
And this sad song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear?

It was hard
But i'd do it again
Holding hands with my friend again
But then again
Maybe we gave our all
A song they'll never forget
Baby let em play it
Maybe it'll save the world

They gon miss hearing it when it'sgone.

What if we loved every moment that we could spare
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear.

You never know where the song's gonna fade
The Last song you hear is the one you made
Your song was beautiful
That's why I started singing it
But this song is ours
So let's play it till the end
Even if it's---Lyrics submitted by tyrae.

Once was a time you and I
Made a promise till the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that I'd get burned
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife

[Hook"]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Fooled me once shame on you
Fooled me twice now this song is through
The things you said I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But I'm still standing tall as I walk away
And you know that it's true when you hear me say
It's over, it's through,
Ain't a thing you can do boy, its' sad but it's true

[Hook:]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye

Good Bye No Baby
Silly me I believed in your fairy tales
Boy I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride all the tears that I cried
And it cuts... like a knife

[Hook:]
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips (ever gonna kiss these lips)
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies (never gonna hear your lies)
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time
To give it one more try
It's over, it's through
Ain't a thing you can do but wonder why
There's only time to say goodbye

Baby goodbye
Never gonna, never gonna cry no more
Goodbye, goodbye

[Another version begins with:
"What am I supposed to do with this heart
How do I take it off if I love it on it's like a work of art"]

How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody tell me how to mend a broken-hearted soul
In love we all will fall but we fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?

It may be wrong but it feels right to be lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise (lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears gone tonight
Let me stay, I'm lost in paradise

On the first page of our story, the future seemed so bright.
    And this thing turned out so evil, I don’t know why I’m still surprised.
    Even angels have their wicked schemes and you take that to new extremes.
    But you’ll always be my hero, even though you lost your mind.

    Just gonna stand there and watch me burn,
    But that’s alright because I like the way it hurts.
    Just gonna stand there and hear me cry,
    But that’s alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie.
    I love the way you lie.

    Now this gravel in our voices, glass is shattered from the fight.
    In this tug of war, you’ll always win, even when I’m right.
    Cause you feed me fables from your hand,
    With violent words and empty threats and it’s sick that all these battles are what keeps me satisfied.

    Just gonna stand there and watch me burn,
    But that’s alright because I like the way it hurts.
    Just gonna stand there and hear me cry,
    But that’s alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie.
    Ohhh, I love the way you lie.

    So maybe I’m a masochist
    I try to run but I don’t wanna ever leave.
    Til the walls are goin’ up in smoke with all our memories.

    [Eminem]
    This morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
    smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction
    hush baby, speak softly, tell me I’ll be sorry that you
    pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
    try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
    run out the room and I’ll follow you like a lost puppy
    baby, without you, I’m nothing, I’m so lost, hug me
    then tell me how ugly I am, but that you’ll always love me
    then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
    destructive path that we’re on, two psychopaths but we
    know that no matter how many knives we put in each other’s backs
    that we’ll have each other’s backs, ’cause we’re that lucky
    together, we move mountains, let’s not make mountains out of molehills,
    you hit me twice, yeah, but who’s countin’
    I may have hit you three times, I’m startin’ to lose count
    but together, we’ll live forever, we found the youth fountain
    our love is crazy, we’re nuts, but I refused counselin’
    this house is too huge, if you move out I’ll burn all two thousand
    square feet of it to the ground, ain’t shit you can do about it
    with you I’m in my f–kin’ mind, without you, I’m out it

    Just gonna stand there and watch me burn,
    But that’s alright because I like the way it hurts.
    Just gonna stand there and hear me cry,
    But that’s alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie.
    Ohhh, I love the way you lie.
    I love the way you lie.---Lyrics submitted by wini.

Ain't nothin' wrong with it...

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, L-O-V-E-E-E and affection

Oh baby, I'm not asking for the world, maybe
You can give me what I want
Baby, come hold me tight and when I'm drowning save me
Give it to me on a daily

If I'm your girl say my name boy
Let me know I'm in control
We both grown so how we feel we can let it show
I I I, won't play around
I I I, I wanna lay you down
I I I, I need you now, I need you now
Oh oh

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, L-O-V-E-E-E and affection

Boy lately, you've been stingy with your time
Got me wondering, I'm wondering if I'm on your mind
Boy I just wanna be in your possession
You say I'm the one you want so come express it

Don't slip, don't slip
Cause a nigga might push up on it
Don't really wanna lose this moment
Why window shop when you own this?
I I I don't put it down
I I I don't fuck around
I I I want you now, I want you now, oh oh whoah

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection

Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, L-O-V-E-E-E and affection

Can you love me for poor (let me know)?
I'm searching for my soul
Whoever turned you cold (beat this)
You need to let 'em know
I can work miracles (what's up?)
I work it physical (physical)
And when I love you close,
You can feel my heart beating thru my clothes

Future...

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection

I didn't mean to end his life
I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night
Can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight
Before I end up behind bars

What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

Rum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Man Down
Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Man Down

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station

It's a 22
I Call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
What you expect me to do
If you're playing me for a fool
I will lose my cool
And reach for my fire arm

I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm ‘bout to leave town (yeah)

Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Could've been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun

Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Man Down
Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Man Down

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station

And I never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Oh, gosh
Whatever happened to me
Ever happened to me
Ever happened to me
Why did I pull the trigger
Pull the trigger, pull the trigger – boom
And end a nigga, end a nigga life so soon
When me pull the trigger, pull the trigger, pull it 'pon you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do

Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum
Me say one man down (oh, let me say)
Rum, pum, pum, pum rum, pum, pum, pum, rum, pum, pum, pum
When we went downtown

Cause now I am a criminal criminal criminal
Oh, lord have mercy now I am a criminal
Man Down
Tell the judge please gimme minimal
Run out a town none a them can see me now

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why? Oh, why?
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In central station ---

Lost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I'm separate from here and now
A drug and a drink
We lost connection, oh come back to me
So I can feel alive again
Soul and body try to mend

It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange
To be in love again
To be in love again
To be in love again

Lost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I'm separate from here and now

It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never ending
Slipped into a peril that I'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
It doesn't have to feel so strange
To be in love again
To be in love again
To be in love again---

911, it's a critical emergency, yea
Better run run run,
Come and charge him with the 143, yea yea
Told me this world was mine
Such a beautiful lie
Now he's done done done and his love is no more for me
hand in the air as he wave me goodbye
He said he care but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga is you blind

Like a bullet your love me hit me to core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish of you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah yeah yeah
Boy, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Fe fo fum like the sky is falling down on me
Numb numb numb, he's so cold he doesn't feel a thing
Broken heart was the case
Gwan and put 'im away
He's the only one one one I ever let get the best of me

hand in the air as he wave me goodbye
He said he care but no tears in his eyes
And ask me if I'm alright
Nigga is you blind

Like a bullet your love me hit me to core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish of you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us
I call it murder, no love allowed
Yeah yeah yeah
Boy, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Usually I'm the one that they cry for
But this man, he's the one that I'd die for
Mama said there's no cause for a rebel
Do you hear me now?

No love, no love, no love allowed

Like a bullet your love me hit me to core
I was flying 'til you knocked me to the floor
And it's so foolish of you keep me wanting more
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us
I call it murder, no love allowed
I'm screaming murderer, how could you murder us
I call it murder, no love allowed---Lyrics submitted by Mommy Katie.

I thought he was the one for me

It should have been me and you

Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up
That's how we ball out
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up
That's how we ball out

Strip clubs and dollar bills
I still got my money
Patron shots, can I get a refill
I still got my money
Strippers going up and down that pole
And I still got my money
Four o clock and we aint going home
Cause I still got my money
Money make the world go around
I still got my money
Bandz make your girl go down
And I still got my money
Lot mo' where dat came from
I still got my money
The minute you wise, you know you want some
I still got my money

Ohhhh

All I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Ohhhhh
Money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall off from the sky
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up
That's how we ball out
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out
That's how we ball out

Valet cost a hundred bills
I still got my money
Gold all up in my grill
I still got my money
Who cares how you haters feel
And I still got my money
Call J up and close a deal
I still got my money
My fragance on and they love my smell
I still got my money
So who cares about what I spend
I still got my money
My pocket's deep, and they never end
I still got my money
I'm going dumb with all my friends
I still got my money

Ohhh all I see is signs
All I see is dollar signs
Ohhhhh money on my mind
Money, money on my mind
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it fall off from the sky
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up
That's how we ball out
Throw it, throw it up
Watch it all fall out
Pour It Up, Pour It Up
That's how we ball out

[Verse 1:]
Baby, baby
When we first met
I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover
And my best friend
All wrapped into one
With a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden
you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shock
That spun me around
And now my heart's dead
I feel so empty and hollow

[Pre Chorus:]
And I'll never give myself to another
The way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize
The ways you hurt me
Do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame

[Chorus:]
And now I feel like, oh
You're the reason
Why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on
These cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get
For wishful thinking
Should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
Cause now I'm using like I bleed
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby you're my disease

[Verse 2:]
Damn,
Ain't it crazy
When you're loveswept
You'll do anything
For the one you love
'Cause anytime
That you needed me
I'd be there
It's like
You were my favorite drug
The only problem is
That you was using me
In a different way
That I was using you
But now that I know
That it's not meant to be
You gotta go
I gotta wean myself off of you

Take a Breathe, take it deep
Calm yourself, he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I'm sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger...

Say a prayer to yourself
He says close your eyes, sometimes it helps
And then I get a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost

And you can see my heart beating
Oh,you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger...

As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering if I will ever see another sunrise?
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's to late to think of the value of my life

And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving, no
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger...---Lyrics submitted by Steve.

There's no way I'm turning back (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Now the pain is my pleasure cause nothing could measure (Oh oh oh oh oh)

Love is great, love is fine (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Out the box, outta line (Oh oh oh oh oh)
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more (Oh oh oh oh oh)

Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

It's exactly what I've been yearning for, give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir, make my body say ah ah ah
I like it-like it

Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na na na na

Come on, come on, come on
I like it-like it (Na na na)
Come on, come on, come on
I like it-like it
Come on, come on, come on

Feels so good being bad (Oh oh oh oh oh)
There's no way I'm turning back (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Now the pain is my pleasure cause nothing could measure (Oh oh oh oh oh)

Love is great, love is fine (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Outta box, outta line (Oh oh oh oh oh)
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more (Oh oh oh oh oh)

Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

[Intro]
Lalala lalala la la lala la Ohhh
You know... I never felt like this before
Lalala lalala la la lala la Ohhh
Feels like.. so real

[Verse 1]
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive just one thought of close enough
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken up, never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help

[Chorus:]
S.O.S. please someone help me.
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making this hard,
I can't take it, see it don't feel right
S.O.S. please someone help me
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin' and can't sleep at night

[Bridge:]
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me,
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

[Verse 2]
Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots so when I see you I get so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (uh huh) you know inside you feel it right
[CD version:] Take me on I'm put desire up in your arms tonight
[Video version:] Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight.
I'm out with you, you got me head over heels
Boy you keep me hanging on the way you make me feel

[Chorus:]
S.O.S. please someone help me.
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making (Y.O.U.) this hard,
You got me tossin' and turnin' and can't sleep at night

[Bridge:]
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it ('Cause you on my mind)
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me (someone come and rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me,
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

Boy, you know you got me feeling open
And boy, your loves enough with words unspoken
I said boy I'm telling you, you got me open
I don't know what to do it's true
I'm going crazy over you,
I'm begging

[Chorus:]
S.O.S. please somebody help me.
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making this hard (are you making this hard for me, baby?),
You got me tossin' and turnin' and can't sleep at night

[Bridge:]
This time please someone come and rescue me (someone rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind got me losing it ('cause any time)
I'm lost you, got me looking for the rest of me,
Got the best of me (best of me), I'm losing it

[Outro]
Lala lala lala lala Ohhh
Ohh ohh lala lala lala lala
Oh oh---Lyrics submitted by tanisha.

I can just hear them now
"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
Worried 'bout every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what is love
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)
(I know there’s too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don’t know why it’s happening
(Stop while it’s not too late)
And I still don’t know

Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
I'm thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
But I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how do I know that it's right?
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)

Man, I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe this story ain’t so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

Feel like a brand new person
So how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking You're the only option was)
Feel like a brand new person
I finally know what it's like
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
And I know it's hard to describe
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
So how will I know that it's right?
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
I finally know what it's like
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)---

[Intro]
You should tell me whats buggin you

Make a wish tell me whats buggin you

Emotions running wild 
I could feel it when I'm next to you,
Something's on ya mind
You wanna stay but wont tell me,

You hold my hand so tightly,

Standing by the door,

Blow your secret open wide

[Verse 2]
I won't shoot you down,
Make you feel some kinda way
If you'll be honest with me
Put away your pride, 
I can see it in your face 
You want me permanently (unh)

And I'm right there wit you
But I won't be the first to out myself out there,
The feeling is mutual
But I bet if you

[Verse 1]
Sell me candy like it’s summer when it’s melting in my hands
I know you’re around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling, whisper something in my ear
You're sweet like sugar, tell me what I wanna hear
I’m weak by your touch and when it’s melting on my lips
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips
You’re selling me a fantasy that I want to explore
It sounds so good spoil me rotten to the core

[Bridge:]
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need
Is you beside me
It’s destiny
Just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby sell it to me

[Chorus:]
Sell me candy, sell me love, sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy)… you the boss.

[Verse 2]
You could be a professional, boy you make a sale
I try to resist but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
The running through my body now you’re knocking at my door
A thin little kiss and your call is really sweet
But the shawty that you’re rocking is nothing like me
You’re selling me a fantasy that I want to explore
It sounds so good spoil me rotten to the core (you know…)

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I wanna play… more than you know
So don’t you leave… and don’t you go
I want it all… until time falls
His arms… I want to roam
I want to love… give him my trust
I want to live… for both of us
I want to breathe you… lay on your shoulder
I want to warm you… when nights get colder
I want love… love… love
I want love… love… love

[Bridge]

[Verse 1]
I've been looking for a driver who's qualified
So if you think that you're the one step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
With a sunroof top and a gangster lean

[Bridge]
So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

[Chorus]
Got you where you wanna go if you know what i mean
Got a ride that smoother than a limosine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can baby boy then we can go all night

Cos I'm 0 to 60 in three point five
Baby you got the keys-

Now shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)

Shut up and drive
(drive, drive, drive)

Got all the drive but a whole lot of boom in the back
You look like you can handle whats under my hood
You keep saying that you will boy I wish you would

Come on now what you waiting for, for, for

You keep saying that you will boy I wish you would

So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

[Chorus]
Got you where you wanna go if you know what i mean
Got a ride that smoother than a limosine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?

[Intro]
Lalala lalala la la lala la Ohhh
You know... I never felt like this before
Lalala lalala la la lala la Ohhh
Feels like.. so real

[Verse 1]
I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive just one thought of close enough
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
'Cause every moment gone you know I miss you
I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close boy 'cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken up, never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help

[Chorus:]
S.O.S. please someone help me.
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making this hard,
I can't take it, see it don't feel right
S.O.S. please someone help me
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making this hard
You got me tossin' and turnin' and can't sleep at night

[Bridge:]
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me,
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

[Verse 2]
Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots so when I see you I get so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock
Take on me (uh huh) you know inside you feel it right
[CD version:] Take me on I'm put desire up in your arms tonight
[Video version:] Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight.
I'm out with you, you got me head over heels
Boy you keep me hanging on the way you make me feel

[Chorus:]
S.O.S. please someone help me.
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making (Y.O.U.) this hard,
You got me tossin' and turnin' and can't sleep at night

[Bridge:]
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it ('Cause you on my mind)
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me (someone come and rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me,
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

Boy, you know you got me feeling open
And boy, your loves enough with words unspoken
I said boy I'm telling you, you got me open
I don't know what to do it's true
I'm going crazy over you,
I'm begging

[Chorus:]
S.O.S. please somebody help me.
It's not healthy... for me to feel this way
Y.O.U. are making this hard (are you making this hard for me, baby?),
You got me tossin' and turnin' and can't sleep at night

[Bridge:]
This time please someone come and rescue me (someone rescue me)
'Cause you on my mind, it's got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me lookin' for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it
This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind got me losing it ('cause any time)
I'm lost you, got me looking for the rest of me,
Got the best of me (best of me), I'm losing it

Lala lala lala lala Ohhh
Ohh ohh lala lala lala lala
Oh oh---Lyrics submitted by tanisha.

All along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air and said show me something
He said, if you dare come a little closer

Round and around and around and around we go
Ohhh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay

It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Ohhh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
And I want you to stay

Ohhh the reason I hold on
Ohhh cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one but I'm the only one who needed saving
Cause when you never see the light it's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay, stay
I want you to stay, ohhh---Lyrics submitted by Joana Soares.

Stupid in love 
Oh 
Stupid in love 

Let me tell you something 
Never have I ever 
Been a size 10 
In my whole life 
I left the engine running 
I just came to see 
What you would do if I 
Gave you a chance 
To make things right 
So I made it 
Even though Katy 
Told me this would be nothing 
But a waste of time 
And she was right 

Dont understand it 
Blood on your hands 
And still you insist 
On repeatedly trying 
To tell me lies 
And I just don't know why 


This is stupid 
I'm not stupid 
Dont talk to me 
Like Im stupid 
I still love you 
But I just cant do this 
I may be dumb but 
I'm not stupid 

My new nickname 
Is you idiot 
(Such an idiot) 
Thats what my friends 
Are calling me when 
They see me yelling 
Into my 
Phone 

They tell me let go 
He is not the one 
I thought I saw your potential 
Guess thats what made me dumb 
He don't want it 
Not like you want it 
Scheming and cheating 
Oh girl, why do you 
Waste your time 
You know he aint right 

Telling me this 
I don't wanna listen 
But you insist 
On repeatedly trying 
To tell me lies 
And I just don't know why 

This is stupid 
I'm not stupid 
Dont talk to me 
Like I'm stupid 
I still love you 
But I just cant do this 
I may be dumb but 
I'm not stupid 

Trying to make this work 
But you act like a jerk 
Silly of me to keep 
Holding on 
But the dunce cap is off 
You don't know what you lost 
And you wont realize 
Till I'm gone, gone, gone 
That I was the one 
Which one of us 
Is really done

Ooh 
No 
No 
No 
I'm not stupid in love 

This is stupid 
I'm not stupid 
Dont talk to me 
Like I'm stupid 
I still love you 
But I just cant do this 
I may be dumb but 
I'm not stupid 

I may be dumb but 
I'm not stupid 
In love---Lyrics submitted by Maria.

Oh, How about a round of applause, Yeah
A standing ovation
Oh, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out

[Chorus:]
Don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow

Grab your clothes and get gone (get gone)
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on (come on)
Talking' bout'
Girl, I love you, you're the one
This just looks like a re-run
Please, what else is on (on)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh, And the award for
The best liar goes to you (goes to you)
For making me believe (that you)
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, Oh

How about a round of applause
A standing ovation

But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
Now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
But it's over now ---Lyrics submitted by celexis.

Te Amo,Te Amo
she says to me
I hear the pain in her voice..
and we danced underneath the candelabra
she takes the lead
that's when I saw it in her eyes it's over
Then she says te amo
then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, 
She cries Te amo
I told her I’m not gonna run away
but let me go
My soul is crying, 
without asking why
I said te amo, 
would somebody tell me what she said?
Don’t it mean I love you
Think it means I love you
Don’t it mean I love you

Te amo, Te amo,
she’s scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice uhh
Pull me out on the beach, danced in the water,
I start to leave
She’s begging me and asking why its over
Then she says te amo
then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no,
She cries Te amo
I told her I’m not gonna run away,
but let me go
My soul is crying,
without asking why
I said te amo,
would somebody tell me what she said?
Don’t it mean I love you
Think it means I love you
don’t it mean I love you

Listen we can dance, 
but you gotta watch your hands
watch me all night, I’m movin' to the night because I understand
that we all need love
and I’m not afraid
to feel the love but I don’t feel that way
Then she says te amo
then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cries te amo
I told her I’m not gonna run away but let me go
My soul is crying,
without asking why
I said te amo,
would somebody tell me what she said?
Don't it mean I love you
Think it means I love you
don’t it mean I love you
Think it means I love you, 
I love you
Te Amo

Don't It means I Love you...---Lyrics submitted by Maria.

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Lost in the rock and roll
Got lost in a promise of a love I never know
(Oh, oh)
Shadows chase me far from home
I remember when my heart was filled with gold
(Oh, oh)
And you know
I've been burned, I've been burned, I've been burned
You've seen me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth
My soul

Lost my faith and trust
You and I know gold don't turn to rust
(Oh, oh)
I still swear that we can reign
Like the kings and queens of better yesterdays
(Oh, oh)
Don't you know
I've been burned, I've been burned, I've been burned
You've seen me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth
My soul

Where you gonna go, where you gonna go
Where you gonna run to
When you get to the edge of the night?
It's time you face the sky, ooh

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you---

Oh baby it's raining---Lyrics submitted by Kiana Douglas.

Story of my life
Searchin for the right
But it keeps avoiding me

Sorrow in my soul
Cause it seems that wrong
really loves my company

He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue

But the clouds are rolling in
Because i'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true

And I know that he knows i'm unfaithful 
And it kills him inside
To know that i'm happy
With some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
 everytime I walk out the door 
I see him die a litle more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be.....  murderer

I feel it in the air 
As i'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
He's here reluctantly
As if i'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long
Just hanging with the girls 
A lie I didn't have to tell
because we both know
where i'm about to go
and we know it very well

Cause I know that he knows i'm unfaithful
and it kills him inside
To know that i'm happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Cause every time I walk out the door 
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be....... a murderer

Our love..... His trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this.......anymore


I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reasons why
cause every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be......... a murderer

 ohhhhhh... murderer
no,no,no yeah---Lyrics submitted by Malavika.

And I know that I'm unfaithful

It's just the way the game is played
It's best that you just wait your turn.

The wait is ova, The wait is ova
The wait is ova, The wait is ova
The wait is ova, The wait is ova
The wait is ova, The wait is ova

I pitch with a grenade...
Swing away if ya feeling brave
There's so much power in my name...
If you pop up and you say it steady
I'm gon do da wave

I'm such a fucking lady
You don't have to be so afraid
Cause I got room up on my team
You can play but hold up.

It's just the way the game is played
It's best that you just wait your turn.


It's getting crowded over here...
But babe...the wait is ova!
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is ova
Fumble don't you fumble
That's a flag on the play
Babe if you don't wanna
Then you don't have to wait

But together we gon be taking over
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn.

So you don't wanna wait
I hate to hear-That's such a shame
Cause if you play it sideways
Aint no time out in ma game
Dey aready on da way
I know you wanna win
and you wish I would let you in
Get in line over here
You can play, but hold up

It's just the way the game is played
It's best that you just wait your turn.

It's getting crowded over here...
But babe...the wait is ova!
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is ova
Fumble don't you fumble
That's a flag on the play
Babe if you don't wanna
Then you don't have to wait
But together we gon'be taking ova

It's just the way the game is played
It's best that you just wait your turn.

Baby put the work in like a champion
Look the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Couldn't be with no one else
You're the only way I'll win

Baby got the whole world standing up
Damn I'm glad I picked ya, took a chance on love
Babe you're up...
the time is now
And now the wait is ovaaaaaaa!

The wait is ova, the wait is ova
the wait is ova, the wait is ova 
Just wait your turn
The wait is ova, the wait is ova
the wait is ova, the wait is ova 
Just wait your turn

It's getting crowded over here...
But babe the wait is ova!
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is ova
Fumble dont' you fumble
That's a flag on the play
Babe if you don't wanna
Then you don't have to wait
But together we gon be taking ova

It's just the way the game is played
It's best that you just wait your turn.

Just wait your turn
The wait is ova, the wait is ova 
the wait is ova, the wait is ova---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
