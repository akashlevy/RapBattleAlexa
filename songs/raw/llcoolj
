[Marley Marl:]
Just kick a little something for them cars that be bumpin

Yeah aight
But we need a beat that they can front to
Oh, that'll work
Be funky
You know what I'm sayin?

(Cars ride by with the boomin systems)
(Cars ride by)

Funky
For all the cars out there
And all the brothers
That like to front in their rides
Check it out

You know it's funky, funky, funky cos you heard it from hear-say
A jam that you love that don't be gettin no airplay
Strictly for frontin when you're ridin around
12 o'clock at night with your windows down
Headlights breakin cos your batteries drain
Armor all on your tires and a big gold chain
Parkin outside of all the hip-hop spots
Push the E-Q and play connect the dots
Leanin to the side, people everywhere
The trunk full of amps, there ain't no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin with the bass in back
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack
Cos they don't understand why I act this way
Pumpin up the funky beat until the break of day
It's because I want attention when i'm ridin by
And the girls be on my jock cos my system's fly

Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me
Cos they be hear me gettin funky frequently
They tell me don't drink and drive, I say what is this
Mind your business
Now pass it around
Laid back, hypnotized by the funky sound
People in the street see me bobbin my head
While I'm checkin out the rapper and the rhyme that he said
I'm frontin, and I don't care if you know
The backseat of my car is like a disco show
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone
Crazy air freshener, who needs cologne
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise - it's 3 o'clock
The girlies, they smile, they see me comin
I'm steady hummin, I got the Funky Drummer drummin
My trunk be shakin, vibratin and rattlin
Pumpin so loud, all the shorties be battlin
A right-hand man's here without the swing
Every chance I get I'm showin off my rings
I can keep it up until the break of dawn
Cos I'm frontin in my ride and my word is bond

Sun roof open, so I can feel the wind blow
I don't give a damn if it cracks my back window
C to the o to the o to the l to the i to the n
To the f to the r to the o to the n to the t to the i to the n
That means I'm chillin
Like Spoonie Gee said, my seats are soft like a bed
They recline way back, so I can get real cosy
I got the gangster tapes in the place
Like a basehead would say: I want bass
I want a hit, I want a dose
You're rollin up smilin, but you can't come close
Cos my system is pumpin loud
Like Rakim said: I wanna move the crowd
I warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE
Tell the cops: you gots to chill with EPMD
This is something devastatin that'll break your trunk
And remember, Uncle L is like the future of the funk

You know what i'm sayin
Word
So next time you're in your ride pumpin it up
Just remember
It's Cool

Conventional methods of makin love kinda bore me

Matter fact I can't wait for your candy rain
[LL Cool J]

Make it last forever, damn the kitty cat's tight
[LeShaun]
Mmm... daddy slow down your flow

Who ain't afraid to pull my hair and spank me from the back
[LL Cool J]
No doubt, I'm the playa that you're talkin about
[LeShaun]
But do you really think that you can work it out
[LL Cool J]
I guarantee shorty it's real, baby stick it out

[Chorus (repeat 2X)]

[Verse Three:]

More flesh than the Greek Fest
[LeShaun]

[LeShaun]
Put my body to the test
Wait wait daddy many niggaz ago
I was a young girl listening to how you flow
Now's my chance to hit you off daddy I'm grown
From the back, from the side
[LL Cool J]
Right, I'm in the zone
One of a kind when it's time to do mine
Camcorder and the whole shit

Let it flow on the screen while we puffs the L
Layin back in the cut while we're under the spell
[LL Cool J]
Word life, I like the way the ep went down
Go to sleep, tomorrow I'll take you back downtown
We'll be

[Chorus (repeat 3X)]---Lyrics submitted by Michellela.

I've been watchin' you from afar,
for as long as I can remmeber
You are all a real man can need
and ever ask for
this is love
this is more than a crush

It was Harlem at the Rucker
I saw with your man
smiling, huh, a coach bag in your hand
I was laying in the coup with my hat turned back
we caught eyes for a moment, and that was that
so skated off, as you strolled off
looking at them legs, god damn they looked so soft (so fine)
I gotta take ya from your man that's my mision
If his love is real he got ta handle competition
you only knew about 5 months (that's right)
besides he drinks too much and smokes too many blunts
and I've been working out everyday thinking bout you
looking at my own eyes in the rear view
cathchin flash backs of our eye contact
wish i could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
i would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I can't believe it, I hadn't had a crush in years

[Chorus]
[2x] hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
Lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush
hey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush

I see you at the bus stop waitin everyday
your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
but i don't want ta violate your relationship
so i lay back in the cut with a crush that'a trip
still he can't stop me from having day dreams
tounging you down with huh vanilla ice cream
kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
searching your body with my tounge girl all night
I wonder one day could it be, simple dreams turnin into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
we would walk down the isle of destiny
what your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
that seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
but there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead
Hey lover

[CHORUS]

Last week I saw ya at the mall
standing at the pay phone bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
telling you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
we talked about traveling the distant lands
escaping all the madness out here in the world
becomin my wife no longer my girl
then, you let your dress fall down to the floor
i kissed you softly and you yearned for more
we experienced pleasure unparallel
into an ocean of love we both fell
swimming in the timeless, currents of pure bliss
fantasies interchanging with each kiss
undying passion unities our souls
togehter we swim until the point of no control
but its a fantasy it(that,you) won't come true
we never even spoke and your man (still) love you
so I'm gonna keep all these feelins inside
keep my dreams alive until the right time..---Lyrics submitted by Carlos Rivera.

When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
and in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl who's as sweet as a dove
for the first time in my life, I see I need love
There I was giggling about the games
that I had played with many hearts, and I'm not saying no names
Then the thought occured, tear drops made my eyes burn
as I said to myself look what you've done to her
I can feel it inside, I can't explain how it feels
all I know is that I'll never dish another raw deal
Playing make believe pretending that I'm true
holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
Saying amor kissing you on the ear
whispering I love you and I'll always be here
Although I often reminsce I can't believe that I found
a desire for true love floating around
Inside my soul because my soul is cold
one half of me deserves to be this way till I'm old
But the other half needs affection and joy
and the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy
I need love
I need love

Romance sheer delight how sweet
I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back, we'll get cozy and huddle
I'll lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
I'll give you a rose, pull out your chair before we eat
kiss you on the cheek and say ooh girl you're so sweet
It's deja vu whenever I'm with you
I could go on forever telling you what I do
But where you at you're neither here or there
I swear I can't find you anywhere
Damn sure you ain't in my closet, or under my rug
this love search is really making me bug
And if you know who you are why don't you make yourself seen
take the chance with my love and you'll find out what I mean
Fantasy's can run but they can't hide
and when I find you I'm gon' pour all my love inside
I need love
I need love

I wanna kiss you hold you never scold you just love you
suck on you neck, caress you and rub you
Grind moan and never be alone
if you're not standing next to me you're on the phone
Can't you hear it in my voice, I need love bad
I've got money but love's something I've never had
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
I love you more than a man who's 10 feet tall
I'd watch the sunrise in your eyes
we're so in love when we hug we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal
you're as soft as a pillow and I'm as hard as steel
It's like a dream land, I can't lie I never been there
maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you this is something that I'll never forget
I need love
I need love

See what I mean I've changed I'm no longer
a play boy on the run I need something that's stronger
Friendship, trust honor respect admiration
this whole experience has been such a revelation
It's taught me love and how to be a real man
to always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you you're my lady and you mean so much
my body tingles all over from the slightest touch
Of your hand and understand I'll be frozen in time
till we meet face to face and you tell me you're mine
If I find you girl I swear I'll be a good man
I'm not gonna leave it in destiny's hands
I can't sit and wait for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
I'll search the whole world for that special girl
when I finally find you watch our love unfurl
I need love
I need love

Girl, listen to me
When I be sittin in my room all alone, staring at the wall
fantasies, they go through my mind
And I've come to realize that I need true love
and if you wanna give it to me girl make yourself seen
I'll be waiting
I love you ---Lyrics submitted by kane.

[Intro:]
I just wanna make sweet love to you, baby, you know what I’m saying?
I just wanna touch you all over… aw, please!
We Came To Party! We Came To Party!
We Came To Party! We Came To Party!
We Came To Party! We Came To Party!
Hey look, I’ve got my hands all on your body!

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
Ain’t no problem, I’m on it – oldest man in the club
Also one of the richest, a hundred bottles of bub
It’s just me and the Russians, we get all of the love
They was aware of the image, they wanna see what he does
TMZ in my face, Oprah all on my couch
Now I’m hosting the Grammys, what is this all about?
International baller, I must admit I had doubts
If they wasn’t callin’ me back, they was callin’ me out
Game moved to the South, I just closed my mouth
Intellect like Belichick when he be switching the routes
I’m too old for the games, no time for the lames
Next challenge? Get this generation screaming my name
Who could do what I did? Boy, I must be the shit
Waved 106 & Park to play date with the kids
People texting my wife, tryna ruin my night
So I help ‘em mind they business with some bottles on ice

[Hook:]
We Came To Party! We Came To Party!
We Came To Party! We Came To Party!
We Came To Party! We Came To Party!
Hey look, I’ve got my hands all on your body!
We Came To Party! We Came To Party!
We Came To Party! We Came To Party!
We Came To Party! We Came To Party!
Hey look, I’ve got my hands all on your body!

[Bridge:]
Desctruction in the club!
Desctruction in the club!
Desctruction in the club!
Desctruction in the club!
Desctruction in the club!
Desctruction in the club!
Desctruction in the club!
Desctruction in the club!

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Oh, no… Big Snoop Dogg
Ice so cold you can see it through the fog
To walk in my shoes it’ll be a little jog
And if you step by the pockets, you gon’ be up in the morgue
The peoples is peepin’, peepin’
The bitches is dippin’, dippin’
So this is the mission, listen, I turn this shit up
It’s the party-rocking, nonstopping, four-hopping, rip and rock
Drippin’ in this motherf-cker, burn up, now turn up!

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
We ain’t flirtin’, we talkin’ – we ain’t dancin’, we walkin’
Teenagers is pointin’, couple cougars are hawkin’
I don’t come here that often, but it’s totally awesome
When you livin’ for real, I don’t consider it flossin’
Panty lines are crossin’, I’m proceedin’ with caution
I don’t shit where I eat, gotta manage your portions
LL Cool J, I’m like the old-school orphan
Representing alone, sittin’ on factory chrome
Shades on, in the zone – Kool Aid smile on my face
My security’s strapped, ain’t no beef, just in case
Me and my man Rich Whites, we in Vegas tonight
Claudine on the celly, make sure that money is right
Red carpet and tuxes, always where the bucks is
Paparazzi are snapping, I can’t believe this is happening
Frustrating the haters, they’re so sick of me rapping
I’m enjoying your blog, I’ve got the same type of passion

[Hook:]

[Bridge 2:]
Fatman Scoop – Maserati Cool J!
Fatman Scoop – Maserati Cool J!
Fatman Scoop – Maserati Cool J!
Fatman Scoop – Maserati Cool J!
They ain’t think I can do it, that’s why I had to debut it
And let the critics review it, that way I spit and it’s Buicks
Since the beginning, I knew it – rollin’ an L in the Buick
Had the guts to pursue it, that’s how a legend should do it

[Hook:]---

(Hook) x2
I say whaddup
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
I say whaddup
Here's your ticket
Hear the drummer get wicked

(Verse 1)
Time to put 'em in the dirt, somebody gettin hurt
Hard time , gets rough
I took a look at my life, cuts like a knife
What I have is not enough
I got alot on my mind, cross the line
Home boy I cut you up
No reason to rhyme, out comes the 9
You lose your mind

(Hook) x2
I say whaddup
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
I say whaddup
Here's your ticket
Hear the drummer get wicked

Hard as hell
Battle anybody
Rock the bells

(Verse 2)
I can't take it no more
My nerves so raw
This economy's out of control
I kick down your door
Put the weapon to your jaw
This time heads gonna roll
I feel so hard, oh my god!
Come back and save my soul
Never settle for the silver muff
The Bronx know my style, give me that goal
I came to test ya, under pressure
Let's see if you paused on 4
I've taken mine now it's the time
Hungry, you've been told
I be fighting for my dream my whole life
But this day to day grinding gets old!
It's the west coastal going postal
Action! who wants that role?

(Hook) x2
I say whaddup
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
I say whaddup
Here's your ticket
Hear the drummer get wicked

(Verse 3)
Release the beast, where's my feast
Feed my hunger pains
Kid's gotta eat, no defeat
My turn to take your grains
Shoot the ring, watch the king
I have perfect aim
And what I bring is gonna swing
The world like a hurricane
I'm gonna show you
What it feels like to go through
The war that I've been through
How it can make you mental
Time to lay down, take off the crown
Business not a game
Hot stock the pound, the time is now
Gotta break these fucking chains

(Hook) x4
I say whaddup
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
I say whaddup
Here's your ticket
Hear the drummer get wicked ---
