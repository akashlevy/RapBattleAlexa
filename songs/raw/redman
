(Intro: Radio DJ)
It's about 40 degree's out there
i know you all out there listening to these sounds
humping in and bumping out yo' jeeps
well...you tell em' mo (fart sound)
that's right and right now were gonna hit you off with one from redman
and er, it's about er..well (oo ahh oo ahh)
he's gonna let the monkey out!

(Verse 1)
(Redman)
Now first of all i'd be the doc smokin' blocks of hash
Alert your fag ass commisioner when I harass because
Hood regulation is, no infiltration
If it's hot to your crew, Then it's hot to the next patient
I'm in The Bricks like backspins on the Knicks
I'm not a playa, but y'all hating me like I'm a pimp
These cars y'all talk about, the Doc already whipped
You 'bout to go downtown bitch, like The Shiznit
Overseas banging kok in the parking lot
I'm overdosing in a Amsterdam coffee shop
And when you lust for hardcore music to bust
Trust that nigger who bubble more
than Alka-Seltzer Cold Plus
Static, niggers actin all dramatic
I'd rather smoke cabbage, in the chair getting tatted
My P.O. tried to violate me for the habit
Because I walked in the office rocking straight karats

(Chorus)
Gonna ride in the hoop' with a freak tonight
Hope to God I don't have to pull the heat tonight
But uhh, light up a L cause I'm a nigger for life
Hustlers, got the shit that'll keep you high!
(Female voice)
Just gently place the balls, into, the mouth, and
hummmmmmmm (x2)

(Verse 2)
(Redman)
Yo, I'm in your local ghetto rolling a Corona Deluxe
Bitch you better hit the 40, fuck a margarita!
Shit I still scam change out the parking meter
And get a bunch of pussies wet overflooding peanuts
Yes, smoke a quarter-sacks, hut one two
My cerebral will keep the white boys sniffing glue
Hotter than Champagne Rump Shaker Part II
Get dap like the Mad Rapper, "Who the fuck are you?"
The Loaded Desperado, I'm cooler than Rollo
(Ay yo, what you hitting Doc?) 
I'm hitting hoes up in the Tahoe
Gettin chickens fighting in the back of the Apollo
Say, "Fuck that!" if I'm a tough act to follow
(Fuck That!) Disagree I bring the beef gyro
Only right I spiral the hot shit that I know
(Eric Sermon)
Then buy a six shot Eclipse with plastic grips
(Redman)
And get a gangsta bitch who love robbing shit!

(Chorus)
Gonna ride in the hoop' with a freak tonight
Hope to God I don't have to pull the heat tonight
But uhh, light up a L cause I'm a nigger for life
Hustlers, got the shit that'll keep you high!
(Female voice)
Just gently place the balls, into, the mouth, and
hummmmmmmm (x2)

(Redman)
It don't stop y'all, it don't stop nigger
You don't stop y'all, it don't stop nigger
I turn an independent woman back into a hoochie
Make a Jew rock a Dashiki and a kufi
(Eric Sermon)
I be the, Nutty Professor, style aggressor
Put rappers under pressure, with no cooker
(Redman)
Rock it to a T. like Booker,
You're straight shook up
I can't hang with pussy nigger who be
scared as hell to push up
Too much money and, not enough time
It be, too many thugs and not enough nines
Hey hoe, here come five-o, stash the blow
Stop sucking on my dick and slide on your Kenneth Coles
(Eric Sermon)
And everytime we look around them niggers on my block
(Redman)
Ay yo them Def Squad motherfuckers keeps it hot

(Chorus)
Gonna ride in the hoop' with a freak tonight
Hope to God I don't have to pull the heat tonight
But uhh, light up a L cause I'm a nigger for life
Hustlers, got the shit that'll keep you high!
(Female voice)
Just gently place the balls, into, the mouth, and
hummmmmmmm (x2)---
