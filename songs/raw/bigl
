[Big L]
One-two, one-two
Kinda tired..
Big L, 'bout ta.. get into some shit
Aight check it out

Yo, fuck all the glamours and glitz, I plan to get rich
I'm from New York and never was a fan of the Knicks
And I'm all about expandin my chips
You mad cause I was in the van with your bitch
with both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne, that you know in your heart
I got style, plus the way that I be flowin is sharp
A while back I used to hustle, sellin blow in the park
Countin G stacks and rockin ice that glow in the dark
Forever - hottie huntin, trigger temper I'm quick to body somethin
You lookin at me like I'm probably frontin
I fuck around and throw, three in your chest and flee to my rest
I'm, older and smarter this is me at my best
I stopped hangin around y'all, cause niggaz like you
be prayin on my downfall, hopin I flop
Hopin I stop, you probably even hope I get locked
or be on the street corner with a pipe, smokin the rock
I got more riches than you, fuck more bitches than you
Only thing I haven't got is more, stitches than you
Fuckin punk, you ain't a +Leader+ what? Nobody +Follow-ed+ you
You was never shit, your mother shoulda swallowed you
(Mmmm.. WHOO!) You on some tagalong flunkie yes man shit
Do me a favor, please get off the next man dick
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever, put your money up
Put your jewels up, no fuck it put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up nigga, or shut your mouth up
before I buck lead, and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red, I'm far from broke, got enough bread
And mad hoes, ask Beavis I get nuttin Butt-head
{*laughter*} My game is, vicious and cruel
Fuckin chicks is a rule
If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool
How come, you can listen to my first album
and tell where a lot of niggaz got they whole style from?
(YEAH!) So what you actin for?
You ain't half as raw, you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga sum'un, 'fore I crack his jaw
You runnin with boys, I'm runnin with men
I'ma be rippin the mics until I'm a hundred and ten
Have y'all niggaz like, "Damnit this nigga done done it again"
I throw slugs at idi-ots, no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch, eight-hundred and fifty rocks
I'm makin wonderful figures
I don't fuck with none of you niggaz
I might pull out this gun on your niggaz
and rob every last one of you niggaz

[Bobbito] YEAHHH! (What?)
[Big L] I'm TIRED
[Bobbito] For somebody tired, that wasn't, that wasn't too bad!---Lyrics submitted by christian.

[Big L]
I drive up and down Harlem blocks, iced out watch
Knots in my socks, cops think I'm selling rocks
Pulling me over too see if I'm drunk
but I'm sober they wouldn't fuck with me if I drove a Nova
Listen Columbo you're mad because your money come slow
And what you make in a year I make in one show
Now you wanna frisk me and search my ride
Call me all kinda names try to hurt my pride 
You're just mad cause I'm a young cat, pockets dumb fat
Talkin bout where the gun at, I been there and done that
I'm through with that illegal life, I'm stayin legit
I love to see cars come cruisin bye and playin my shit
I walk around with six thou' without a pist-al, my whole click's wild
I'm rich pal, no more sticks I'm makin hits now
I drink Cristal, I'm through breakin laws
I don't sell coke anymore, I do tours
So get that flashlight out of my face
To bring me down them Jakes'll do whatever it takes
Word up them federals got my phone and my house tapped
Praying that I fall for the mouse trap, I doubt that

[Chorus: Big L]

Why do I end up in so much shit
I done came way too far to be callin it quits
Jake wanna lock me up even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother pockets get thick

[Fat Joe]
Aiyyo enough's enough, federals try to set me up
Put me in cuffs and crush what I lust into dust
Plus, they want a nigga sewed, but they know 
Big Joey Crack ain't never rat a cat that he know
Fo' sho', death before dishonor; I left the streets alone
since Tone deceased it almost killed his mama
So I'ma keep doin what I'm doin
Pursuin my dream til there enough cream to start my own union
And show these kids how legit it is
Shit is real I used to steal but now I own several businesses
So where's your witness that you claim to have, sayin that I'm takin half
Extortin New York and not payin tax
I'm layin back, playin the role, playin the low
But it's the same ol Joe so don't get K.O.d
Hey yo I'm gonna fry for what I never did
or catch a heavy bid, why don't they just let a nigga live?

[Chorus x2]

"What would you do..
if the vicious enemy suddenly started comin at you..
armed to the teeth, and ready to kill you?"---Lyrics submitted by mike.

Let me get to the point real quick 
When ya pockets are thick 
mad chicks be on a brothers tip 
When ya sportin jewels and drivin in a groovy car 
all the ho's go sweat you like a movie star 
to get in ya pockets 
thats what the girls wanna do 
but if you not rich them chicks gonna front on you 
no matter how strong your rap 
you only nock boots when you got loot 
you on the map 
cause if you broke youll get a wack slut 
if you got dough you get a ho with a fat butt 
with fresh gear,long hair and a cute face 
and if ya live alone shes gonna pack her suit case and move in 
then ya start loosin all ya bucks 
soon you broke as a joke and out of luck 
then she takes off and brakes off 
ya ho's gone, so long dear 
I'm outta here a good relationships been torn 
Cause when you on top everythings OK 
but when you broke you get no play 

Chorus: 

If you dont got endz you wont be gettin no skinz 
And if you dont got money you wont skoop a honey 
If you dont got cash you wont be gettin no ass 
And if you dont got loot you wont be knockin no boots 

Verse Two: 

Girls of the 90's aint nuthin but crooks 
Its all about whats in ya pockets not how ya look 
that's why you cant talk to just any whore 
leavin brothers for the next man cause he's got a penny more 
they want a drug dealer not a scholar 
some girls barely speak but allways askin for a dollar 
and if you pushin a fresh Benz theyll be ya best friends 
yeah, as long as you collect endz 
you think shes all yours 
but as soon as your dough go your ho go 
now you solo 
but when you was makin papers sucker jumped ho's 
you bought dumb clothes for all of them bum ho's 
and you was takin em to the movies every weekend 
now that you dead broke the girls not speakin 
cause nowadays girls want you to crook 
the only thing they can get from Big L is a big.... 
Cause when you on top everythings OK 
But when you broke you gets no play 

Chorus 2X 

Verse Three: 

I tell it how it is cause im a goldfigga 
and I hate a money hungry girl a.k.a. golddigger 
it aint even funny 
some girls dont even know me askin me can they get some money 
I'm lookin nuthin like ya poppa 
I wouldnt give a chick 10 cent to put cheese on a Whopper 
they wanna know why im so fly 
a girl ask me for a ring and i put one around her whole eye 
Chicks used to diss but now they wanna kiss 
Yo Showbiz I'ma break it down like this 

Chorus 2X 

Outro: 

It's like that y'all, and that's a fact y'all 
I hit hoes from the back and dont give a jack y'all 
It's Big L y'all, I'm livin swell yall 
I do my famous, spell my name, ring bells y'all 
(If you dont got endz) 
Girls be frontin 
(If you dont got endz) 
They aint givin up nuthin 
(If you dont got endz) 
all the girls they ignore you 
(If you dont got endz) 
they act like they never saw you 
(If you dont got endz).........---Lyrics submitted by Donte.

[Big L]
Yeah, it's the Big L
Comin at you once again, in nine-five
And I dedicate this one
to all my peoples from Uptown.. and everywhere
Check it!

Yo where I'm from it ain't cookies and cream
There's a lot of peer pressure growin up as a young teen
You never know when you gonna get wet
Cause mad clowns be catchin wreck with a tec just to get a rep
Instead of cool friends, they'd rather hang with male thugs
Instead of goin to school, they'd rather sell drugs
It's best to go the right route and not the wrong one
Because it's gonna catch up witchu in the long run
Brothers be all up on us, actin stupid, gettin lifted
They life is twisted, and most of them are quite gifted
In other words, they got TALENT; but they'd rather sell cracks
and bust gats and run the streets actin violent
To them it's all about hittin skinz and makin some easy green
Cause that's all they show you on the TV screen
All they care about is a buck or bustin a sweet nut
They don't give a (WHAT?) cause they street struck

Chorus: Big L

You betta listen when L rhyme; cause bein street struck'll
get you nuttin but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme; cause bein street struck'll
get you nuttin but a bullet or jail time

[Big L]
Before the rap contract, I was sellin crack
Stay strapped with a Mac, I was into alla that
I started rappin and got nice as hell
If it wasn't for this I might be doin life in jail
And some of my peeps are still in the game sellin 'caine
If that's what you gotta do to maintain, go 'head and do your thang
But with the cash profit make an investment
And try not to go to the grave like the rest went
Cause you can be rich with crazy loot, own a house and nine cars
What good is that, if you're dead, or behind bars?
And yo it's not even funny
I've seen a lot of my peers give up they careers for some fast money
They could've been boxers, ballplayers or rap singers
Instead they bank robbers and crack slingers
Aiyyo they used to be legit kids, now they corrupt
They had dreams but gave em up cause they street struck

Chorus: repeat 2X

[Big L]
I still chill with my peeps in the streets; but most of the time
I'm in the crib, writin rhymes to some dope beats
Or either callin up some freaks to bone
But word up, I try to leave the streets alone
But it's crazy hard kid, in other words, it's spooky
The streets be callin me, like the crack be callin Pookie
It ain't a dumb joke, listen to this young folk
Cause where I'm from -- you can choke from the gunsmoke
Stay off the corners; that might be your best plan
Before you catch a bullet that was meant for the next man
Or end up with a deep cut
Or relaxin on a hospital bed, from bein street struck

Chorus: repeat 2X

[Big L]
Worrrd up!
Aiyyo take it from me, the Big L
Cause I been through it all, youknowhatI'msayin?
Stay off them corners you'll stay out of trouble
And I gotta say rest in peace to all the cats teasin streets
I'm outta here---Lyrics submitted by Elias.
