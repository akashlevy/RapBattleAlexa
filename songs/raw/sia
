I was born in a thunderstorm
I grew up overnight
I played alone
I'm playing on my own
I survived

Hey
I wanted everything I never had
Like the love that comes with light
I wore envy and I hated that
But I survived

I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry in your pillow
But I'll survive

I'm still breathing
I'm alive

I found solace in the strangest place
Way in the back of my mind
I saw my life in a stranger's face
And it was mine

I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry in your pillow
But I survived

I'm still breathing
I'm alive

You took it all, but I'm still breathing

I had made every single mistake
That you could ever possibly make
I took and I took and I took what you gave
But you never noticed that I was in pain
I knew what I wanted; I went in and got it
Did all the things that you said that I wouldn't
I told you that I would never be forgotten
I know that's part of you

And I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing
I'm alive (You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
(You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
I'm alive (You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
(You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
I'm alive (You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
(You took it out, but I'm still breathing)
I'm alive

I'm alive---

Beautiful calm driving
Deep sea of pearl diving
Constantly unwinding
Beautiful calm driving

You turned into another
You turned into another
You turned into another man

You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me

Beautiful calm driving
Emotional hiding
Effortlessly shining
Beautiful calm driving

You turned into another
You turned into another
You turned into another man

You're a stranger to me
You're a danger to me

Beautiful calm driving---Lyrics submitted by Jasmine.

Tough girl in the fast lane
No time for love, no time for hate
No drama, no time for games
Tough girl whose soul aches

I'm at home on my own
Check my phone, nothing though
Act busy, order in, pay TV
It's agony

I may cry ruining my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking

Tough girl, I'm in pain
It's lonely at the top
Blackouts and airplanes
I still pour you a glass of champagne
Tough girl whose soul aches

I'm at home on my own
Check my phone, nothing though
Act busy, order in, pay TV
It's agony

I may cry ruining my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking

I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up alone

I may cry ruining my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking---

Clipped wings, I was a broken thing
Had a voice, had a voice but I could not sing
You would wind me down
I struggled on the ground
So lost, the line had been crossed
Had a voice, had a voice but I could not talk
You held me down
I struggle to fly now

But there's a scream inside that we are frightened
We hold on so tight, we cannot deny
Eats us alive, oh it eats us alive
Yes, there's a scream inside that we are frightened
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

I'm not gon' care if I sing off key
I find myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I shout it out like a bird set free
No I don't care if I sing off key
I find myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free

Now I fly, hit the high notes
I have a voice, have a voice, hear me roar tonight
You held me down
But I fought back loud

But there's a scream inside that we are frightened
We hold on so tight, we cannot deny
Eats us alive, oh it eats us alive
Yes, there's a scream inside that we are frightened
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

I'm not gon' care if I sing off key
I find myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I shout it out like a bird set free
No I don't care if I sing off key
I find myself in my melodies
I sing for love, I sing for me
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free
I'll shout it out like a bird set free---

Help, I have done it again
I've have been here many times before
Hurt, myself again today
And, the worst part is there's no one else to blame

Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I'm small, and needy
Warm me up. and breathe me

Ouch, I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah I think that I might break
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe 

Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I'm small, and needy
Warm me up, and breathe me.---Lyrics submitted by pablo acuna.

You're dark grey like a storm cloud
Swelling up with rain that is desperate to be let out
And I know it’s a heavy load carrying those tears around
Carrying those fears around
Worry makes the world go round
You're twisted up like a slipknot
Tied by a juice head, who just took his T-shirt
And I know there's a hungry dog
Tugging at your frayed ends
But he’s just playing with you, he just wants to be your friend
So don’t worry don’t worry
I’m here by your side
By your side, by your side
We’re letting go tonight

Yesterday is gone and you will be OK
Place your past into a book
Burning pages let them cook
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today
Place your past into a book
Burning pages let them cook

Eyes stinging from the black smoke
New hope, loose rope
Risen from the undertow
All is well we welcome the cry of the dark night sky
Swallow me peacefully, follow my heart back inside
So don’t worry don’t worry
I’m here by your side
By your side, by your side
We’re letting go tonight

Yesterday is gone and you will be OK
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages let them cook
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today
Place your place into a book
Burn the pages let them cook

Don’t worry don’t worry
I’m here by your side
By your side, by your side
We’re letting go tonight

Yesterday is gone and you will be OK
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages let them cook
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages let them cook ---

All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A
California dreamin' on such a winter's day

I stopped into a church I passed along the way
Well I got down on my knees and I pretended to pray
You know the preacher liked the cold, he knows I'm gonna stay
California dreamin' on such a winter's day

I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm

All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
If I didn't go, I could leave today
California dreamin' on such a winter's day
Oh such a winter's day
On such a winter's day---

Look at me I’m such a basket case 
Delivered to you wrapped in cellophane 
Waiting on your doorstep, out your day 
Delivery, a basket filled with pain 

Patience is your virtue, saint o’ mine 
I’d have fallen through the cracks without your love tonight 
I’m your groundhog, and I'm skating on thin ice 
But you see me at your feet and carry me inside 

Eh eh eh eh 
Eh eh eh eh 

Oh, can't you see I’m wrapped in cellophane? 
Watch the blood pump through my veins 
Electricity floods my brain 
Can’t hide the pain 
Can’t hide the pain 
When you’re wrapped in cellophane 

Look at me I’m such a basket case 
While I fall apart, you hide all my pills again 
And all the things I need to hear you say 
You’ll watch as all my thoughts get right back on the train 

Eh eh eh eh 
Eh eh eh eh 

Oh, can't you see I’m wrapped in cellophane? 
Watch the blood pump through my veins 
Electricity floods my brain 
Can’t hide the pain 
Can’t hide the pain 
When you’re wrapped in cellophane 

Oh 

Can't you see I’m wrapped in cellophane? 
Watch the blood pump through my veins 
Electricity floods my brain 
Can’t hide the pain 
Can’t hide the pain 
When you’re wrapped in cellophane---

Party girls don't get hurt
Can't feel anything, when will I learn
I push it down, push it down

I'm the one "for a good time call"
Phone's blowin' up, they're ringin' my doorbell
I feel the love, feel the love

1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink

Throw em back, 
till I lose count

I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, 
from the chandelier
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, 
feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, 
from the chandelier

And I'm holding on for dear life, 
won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light, 
'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
Help me, I'm holding on for dear life, 
won't look down won't open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light, 
'cause I'm just holding on for tonight
On for tonight

Sun is up, I'm a mess
Gotta get out now, 
gotta run from this
Here comes the shame, 
here comes the shame

1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink
1,2,3 1,2,3 drink

Throw 'em back till I lose count

I'm gonna swing from the chandelier,

I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist
Like it doesn't exist
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, 
feel my tears as they dry
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier,

Help me, I'm holding on for dear life,

Keep my glass full until morning light,

Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night and I won't be long
Gotta do my hair, I put my make up on
It's Friday night and I won't be long

Til I hit the dance floor
Hit the dance floor

But I got you baby

Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight

But I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing

Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Saturday and I won't be long
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
It's Saturday and I won't be long

Death by chocolate is myth
This I know because I lived
I've been around for broken hearts and how
Lay your head in my hands little girl
This is only right now

Death by crying doesn't exist, though
The headaches feel a bit like it
You might explode
But you reach the end of the road
And you, little tree
I'm certain you will grow

Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn
Just how to love again
Oh my weeping willow
Let your leaves fall and return
Oh darling the seasons are your friend

Death by anger this is true
Just let him go he can't hurt you
Oh little girl this is such a cruel cruel world
This is the first, of a million broken hearts

Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn
Just how to love again
Oh my weeping willow
Let your leaves fall and return
Oh darling the seasons are your friend

Oh it won't be long you will grow strong
Up up and away

He's but a falling leaf, he's but a falling leaf, he's but a falling leaf---Lyrics submitted by mark.

Faint light of dawn 
I'm listening to you breathing in and breathing out 
Needing nothing 
You're honey dipped 
You are beautiful, floating clouds, soft world 
I can't feel my lips 

I'm going down, I don't want to change 
I'm going down, going down the drain 

Don't bring me down, I beg you 
Don't bring me down, I won't let you 
Don't bring me down 

Then all of that's annulled and I'm ayone's everyone's 
We are one 
Your face becomes the sun 
And I'm addicted to the joy that the little things 
Those little things 
The little things they bring 

I'm going down, I don't want to change 
I'm going down, going down the drain 

Don't bring me down, I beg you 
Don't bring me down, I won't let you 
Don't bring me down 

So now for restless mind, I could go either way 

I'm going down, I don't wanna change 
I'm going down, going down the drain 

Don't bring me down, I beg of you 
Don't bring me down, I won't let you 
Don't bring me down, I beg you 
Don't bring me down, don't let me---Lyrics submitted by Sarah Ann Grima.

I had given up 
I didn’t know who to trust 
So I designed a shell 
Kept me from heaven and hell 
And I had hit a low 
Was all I let myself know 
Yeah I had locked my heart 
I was imprisoned by dark 

You found me dressed in black 
Hiding way up at the back 
Life had broken my heart into pieces 
You took my hand in yours 
You started breaking down my walls 
And you covered my heart in kisses 
I thought life passed me by 
Missed my tears, ignored my cries 
Life had broken my heart, my spirit 
And then you crossed my path 
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh 
Then you covered my heart in kisses 

I was down for the count 
I was down I was out 
And I had lost it all 
'Cause I was scared, I was torn 
And I took to the night 
I’d given in to the fight 
And I slipped further down 
I felt like I had drowned 

You found me dressed in black 
Hiding way up at the back 
Life had broken my heart into pieces 
You took my hand in yours 
You started breaking down my walls 
And you covered my heart in kisses 
I thought life passed me by 
Missed my tears, ignored my cries 
Life had broken my heart, my spirit 
And then you crossed my path 
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh 
Then you covered my heart in kisses 

I was hopeless and broken 
You opened the door for me 
Yeah I was hiding and you let the light in 
And now I see 
That you do for the wounded 
What they couldn't seem to 
You set them free 
Like a butterfly kissing a child with an eye for the minor key 

You found me dressed in black 
Hiding way up at the back 
Life had broken my heart into pieces 
You took my hand in yours 
You started breaking down my walls 
And you covered my heart in kisses 
I thought life passed me by 
Missed my tears, ignored my cries 
Life had broken my heart, my spirit 
And then you crossed my path 
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh 
Then you covered my heart in kisses 

Covered my heart in kisses---

And another one bites the dust
Oh why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons

And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one

You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard,
I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart

And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life

And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one

You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace

Well, I've got thick skin and an elastic heart,
But your blade it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard,
I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart

I've got an elastic heart---

Take me down
I’m feeling now
And the fire moves on
I admit to go
And I ain’t ready
But I’ll hold steady
Yeah I’ll hold you
In my arms, in my arms
In my arms

And I’m left inside my hole
And your melody are my home
And I won’t let the terror in and steal them down
Through the eye of the needle

Stopping a beat
Tears fall to the beat
Smile will draw the pain
Feel the ashtray
And I ain’t ready
But I’ll hold steady
Yeah I’ll hold you
In my arms, in my arms
In my arms

And I’m left inside my hole
And your melody are my home
And I won’t let the terror in and steal them down
Through the eye of the needle

My bells help me
Being, feeling 'bout me
They were here down
Carry down road
It’s a mine, oh mine
Oh I am blind
Defy the eye of the needle

And I’m left inside my hole
And your melody are my home
And I won’t let the terror in and steal them down
Through the eye of the needle
Eye of the needle
And I’m left inside my hole
And your melody are my home
And I won’t let the terror in and steal them down
Through the eye of the needle ---

You terrify me 
Cause you’re a man- you’re not a boy 
You've got some power 
And I can’t treat you like a toy 
The road less...Traveled by a little girl 
You disregard the mess 
While I try to control the world 
Don’t leave me 
Stay here and frighten me 
Don’t leave me 
Come now enlighten me 
Give me all you got 
Give me your wallet and your watch 
Give me your first born 
Give me the rainbow and the- 
So go on and challenge me 
Take the reigns and the seat 
Watch me squirm baby 
But you are just what I need 
And I've never played a fair game 
I’ve always had the upper hand 
But what good is intellect and nerve if 
I can’t respect any man 
Yeah I want to play a fair game 
Yeah I want to play a fair game 

You terrify me 
We’ve still not kissed 
And yet I’ve cried 
You got too close in 
I pushed and pushed 
Opened your bites 
So I could run run 
And then I did betray the dust 
You saw those teeth marks 
They weren’t all yours 
You had been trusted to a history 
That had not worked for me 
Into a history from which I could not face 
So go on and shake me 
Shake until I give it up 
When I am in doubt baby 
I know that we could make some love 

So go on challenge me 
Take the reigns and the seat 
Watch me squirm baby 
But you’re just what I need 
And I've never played a fair game 
I’ve always had the upper hand 
But what good is intellect and nerve if 
I can’t respect any man 
Yeah I want to play a fair game 
Yeah I want to play a fair game 
And I never played a fair game 
I’ve always had the upper hand 
But what good is intellect and nerve if 
I can’t respect any man 
Yeah I want to play a fair game 
Yeah I want to play a fair game 

I’ve always had the upper hand 
But what good is intellect and nerve if 
I can’t respect any man

It’s dangerous to fall in love, but I
Wanna burn with you tonight
You hurt me
There’s two of us
We’re certain with desire
The pleasure is pain and fire, burning
So come on now
I’ll take you on
Take you on, I
Hate for love, in for us, why
Why don't you come, don't you come a little closer?
So come on now
Strike the match
Strike the match now
And a perfect match
Perfect somehow
We were meant for one another
Come a little closer

Flame and candle meet
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I’m burning alive
I can barely breathe
And you feel love for me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I got all I need
When you came back for me
Fire meet gasoline
I’m burning alive
And I can barely breathe
And you're in love with me
Fire meet gasoline
Burn with me tonight

And we will rise
Like smoke darkening the sky
I’ll meet on the drive
Take on fire
So come on now
Strike the match
Strike the match now
And a perfect match
Perfect somehow
We were meant for one another
Come a little closer

Flame and candle meet
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I’m burning alive

And Ian barely breathe
And you're in love with me
Fire meet gasoline
Burn with me tonight

But it’s about best, certain death
But I want what I want, and I gotta get it
When the fire dies
Darken the skies
Hot ash, dead match only smoke is left
It’s about best, certain death
But I want what I want, and I gotta get it
When the fire dies
Darken the skies
Hot ash, dead match only smoke is left

Flame and candle meet
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I’m burning alive
I can barely breathe
And you feel love for me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I got all I need
When you came back for me
Fire meet gasoline

I can barely breathe
And you're in love with me
Fire meet gasoline
Burning tonight

Burn with me tonight
Burn with me tonight
Burn with me tonight
Eh eh---

I love you so 
Wanna throw you from the roof 
The pressure builds 
Wanna put my hands through you 
I’ll squeeze you tight until you take your last breath 
Loving you to death 
Loving you to death 

The pressure’s rising I won’t make it through tonight 
This love immortal is an assassin's delight 
Just blow me up or run me down or cut my throat 
And when it's time for you to die 
I’ll let you know 

Detonate me 
Shoot me like a cannon ball 
Granulate me 
Kill me like an animal 
Decapitate me 
Hit me like a baseball 
Emancipate me 
Free the animal 
Free the animal 

I love you so I’m putting you in quicksand 
You take your chances when you kiss the hit-man 
The animal’s inside of this infinite jest 
Loving you to death, loving you to death 

The pressure’s rising I won’t make it through tonight 
This love immortal is an assassin's delight 
Just blow me up or run me down or cut my throat 
And when it's time for you to die 
I’ll let you know 

Detonate me 
Shoot me like a cannon ball 
Granulate me 
Kill me like an animal 
Decapitate me 
Hit me like a baseball 
Emancipate me 
Free the animal 
Free the animal 

Detonate me 
Shoot me like a cannon ball 
Granulate me 
Kill me like an animal 
Decapitate me 
Hit me like a baseball 
Emancipate me 
Free the animal 
Free the animal 

Murder me, ruin me 
Look what you do to me 
Beautiful pain baby 
Pour acid rain on me 
Kill me with your loving 
Kill me with your loving 
I’ll slice you and dice you 
Like sugar and spice 
I’ll do all that you want me to 
I’ll beat on the beast in you 
I’ll kill you with my with my loving 
I’ll kill you with my loving 

Murder me, ruin me 
Look what you do to me 
Beautiful pain baby 
Pour acid rain on me 
Kill me with your loving

I’ll do all that you want me to 
I’ll beat on the beast in you 
I’ll kill you with my with my loving 
I’ll kill you with my loving 

Detonate me 
Shoot me like a cannon ball 
Granulate me 
Kill me like an animal 
Decapitate me 
Hit me like a baseball 
Emancipate me 
Free the animal

I've stuck around, through thick and through thin
You cannot deny, I've always been in
But I've watched you stand, still as a snowman
But I don't see you change, you're always at meltdown

Yeah I've been your crutch, your smell sight and touch
Yeah I took you home when you've drunk too much
But I can't survive, with you by my side
See I'll never get laid, while I'm running your life

No I just don't wanna, so I'm walking away
There is nothing that you can do I will not stay
No I don't need drama, so I'm walking away
Yeah I am a girl with a lot on her plate

So just cut me loose, learn to tie your shoes
There's somebody here, I'd like to introduce
So look in the mirror, look for the glass
'Cause you're not my problem, you are my last

No I just don't wanna, so I'm walking away
There is nothing that you can do I will not stay
No I don't need drama, so I'm walking away
Yeah I am a girl with a lot on her plate

No I just don't wanna, so I'm walking away
There is nothing that you can do I will not stay
No I don't need drama, so I'm walking away
I'm just a girl that you lost to cocaine---Lyrics submitted by haley.

Could never met the kind that keeps these thoughts I lie in, turn out on the spot watch it all pass by
I lie here awaiting for the tears while I pass the years
I kinda seemed to move, nothing more to lose waiting in the base that we used to use
I lie here awaiting for the tears while I pass the years

You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down

It's dirty like it is, everything's a mess, I can only save but your last kiss
I lie here awaiting for the tears while I pass the years
I cannot show my face, blurred in your embrace , I am controlling your taste
I lie here awaiting for the tears while I pass the years

You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down

These memories
way on me
make believe sets me free
I long for you

You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hod me down
You hold me down
You hold me down---Lyrics submitted by Daniel Salazar.

You bring me to life 
Then you shut me out 
You keep me silent 
When I should shout 
You make me cry and you make me come 
You are the cop and I'm on the run 

It all begins with just one kiss 
I'm held hostage by your love 
Put me in cuffs 
Lock me up 
I'm held hostage by your touch 
This prison is rough but 
I can't get enough 
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs 
Don’t lock me up 
Don’t you wanna free us 
I'm held hostage by your love 

Then you let me out 
And I catch the sun 
You give me a taste of you and no one 
But you always leave 
And again I'm alone 
This secret burns but I'm imprisoned 

It all begins with just one kiss 
I'm held hostage by your love 
Put me in cuffs 
Lock me up 
I'm held hostage by your touch 
This prison is rough but 
I can't get enough 
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs 
Don’t lock me up 
Don’t you wanna free us 
I'm held hostage by your love 

The secret life 
Of lovers who have others 
Under the covers 
And while 
You break my heart 
I’m a criminal in these parts 

It all begins with just one kiss 
I'm held hostage by your love 
Put me in cuffs 
Lock me up 
I'm held hostage by your touch 
This prison is rough but 
I can't get enough 
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs 
Don’t lock me up 
Don’t you wanna free us 
I'm held hostage by your love 

It all begins with just one kiss 
I'm held hostage by your love 
Put me in cuffs 
Lock me up 
I'm held hostage by your touch 
This prison is rough but 
I can't get enough 
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs 
Don’t lock me up 
Don’t you wanna free us 
I'm held hostage by your love---

Watching the sequence of sounds coming out of your mouth
But the snow is too loud
Follow the hands as they move
Trying to make out your mould
But your brain doesn't want to

Hi, close the door, silent cold
For youuuuuu
What have I done to you

Kill and run
Kill and run
I'm one, off the dirty guns
Kill and run
Kill and run
A bullet through your heart

Interpret your eyes as they die
Should I die should I now
Your poor lashes blow
We've done of sanctuary laugh
You cry all over
An innocent call

Hi, close the door, silent cold
For youuuuuu
What have I done to you

Kill and run
Kill and run
I'm one, off the dirty guns
Kill and run
Kill and run
A bullet through your heart ---

I woke up thinking you were still here
My hands shaking with regret
I've held this dream for such a long long time
And I wanna get up
To the rhythm of a wild, to the rhythm of a wild heart
That beats, that beats like a rolling drum

I saw you standing on the corner
I saw you standing on your own
And I get the feeling that it's, it's all a dream
And I wanna get up
To the rhythm of a wild, to the rhythm of a wild heart
That beats, that beats like a drum

When I fall asleep I can see your face
What I lost in you I will not replace
And I could run away, I could let them down
But I will remember your light

Your light it follows me in darkness
I'm trying hard but I can't win
And I've played the victim for a long long time
And I wanna grow up
From the rhythm a young, from the rhythm of a younger heart
It leads just like a river runs

That night I sent over the parkway
The summer's gone and I'm alone
And I get the feeling that you're somewhere close
And I wanna get up
To the rhythm of your wild, to the rhythm of your wild heart
It beats, been beating since you've gone

When I fall asleep I can see your face
What I lost in you I will not replace
And I could run away, I could let them down
But I will remember

When I fall asleep I can see your face
What I lost in you I will not replace
And I could run away, I could let them down
And I know you're gone but still I will remember your light

I will remember [x4]

And if you see me in the darkness
I hope you know I'm not alone
I carry you with every breath I take
I won't let up, I won't let up
Until the wind is gone---

Poetry in your body
You got it in every way
And can't you see it's you I am watching
I am hot for you in every way
And turn around, let me see you
Wanna free you with my rhythm
I know you can't get enough
When I turn up with my rhythm

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
Move your body, move your body
I wanna be your muse, do your music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
Move your body, move your body
Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight
Move your body, move your body
I wanna be your muse, do your music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
Move your body, move your body

Pain in your body
Got you started or never end
Feel my rhythm in your system
This is heaven, I'm your only friend
Feel the beat in your chest
Beat your chest like an animal
Free the beast from it's cage
Free the rage like an animal

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
Move your body, move your body
I wanna be your muse, do your music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
Move your body, move your body
Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight
Move your body, move your body
I wanna be your muse, do your music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
Move your body, move your body

Your body's poetry
Move your body for me
Your body's poetry
Move your body for me
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me...

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
Move your body, move your body
I wanna be your muse, do your music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
Move your body, move your body
Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight
Move your body, move your body
I wanna be your muse, do your music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
Move your body, move your body---

My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, leave you blind
My love, you have found peace
You were searching for release

You gave it all into the call
You took a chance and
You took the fall for us

You came thoughtfully
Loved me faithfully
You taught me honor
You did it for me

Tonight you will sleep for good
You will wait for me, my love

Now I am strong, you gave me all
You gave all you had
And now I am home

[ From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/s/sia-lyrics/my-love-lyrics.html ]
My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, leave you blind
My love, look what you can do
I am mending, I'll be with you

You took my hand and added a plan
You gave me your heart
I asked you to dance with me

You loved honestly
Did what you could release
Ah, ooh

I know you're pleased to go
I won't relieve this love

Now I am strong, you gave me all
You gave all you had
And now I am home

My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, I'll be with you---Lyrics submitted by SADEQ M LAQA.

Under the moonlight
Weathering with your warm embrace
I feel so safe here
Baby we're worth the wait
Yeah I picked the wrong kind
Time after time
I drank from the poisoned wine
Yeah I picked the wrong kind
But baby you're alright
Yeah baby I seen the light

I got a feeling, I got a feeling
Danger is coming, a danger is coming
A danger is coming,
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
The war has been won here, the war has been won here

Under the moonlight, under your moonlit gaze
I know that I'd take one million bullets babe
Yeah, one million bullets can come my way
But I want you to know that, I'd take a million babe

How many would you take?
How many would you take?
Cause I'd take one million bullets babe

If you were a poet and I was a faultless muse
If you were the hero, yeah, I'd take a bullet for you
So take me in your arms, take me for all I have
Cause I'd give my life for one your belly laughs

I got a feeling, I got a feeling
Danger is coming, a danger is coming
A danger is coming,
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
The war has been won here, the war has been won here

Under the moonlight, under your moonlit gaze
I know that I'd take one million bullets babe
Yeah, one million bullets can come my way
But I want you to know that, I'd take a million babe---

You have her pictures
you have her pictures 
you have her pictures every were
your covered in stitches, your covered in stitches
you think I can't see them but I know their there.

~chorus
Take her down from the world
and hurt your self for her
you can't keep her frozen doorman at your core
you can try to move on, triped by stitches come undone

you lost your big heart, you lost your big heart
you lost your big heart being bare
she gave yuou a new start, she gave you a new start
But you know you lost her to dispare

(oh, oh, oh)
(chorus)

Your skin burns and prickles, your skin burns and prickles
Your skin burns and prickles when shes near...
You try to play it cool, you try to play it cool
You try to play it cool but your filled with fear

(oh, oh, oh, oh, oh , oh,oh,oh)
(chorus)

Take her down from the world
Let her go make her yours
You can't keep her frozen, doorman at your core
you can try to move on, tripped by stitches come undone
you can try to move on, tripped by stitches come undone
you can try to move on, tripped by stitches come undone
you can try to move on, Or maybe she is the one...---Lyrics submitted by Adrienne.

Broke down, thought that I would drown
Hope that I've been found, 'fore I hit the ground
Sun rays out the corner of my eye, hey
Saw you weeping, saw you creeping
Saw you sneaking in the shadow's dawn
I feel so strong
Saw you out the corner of my eye

Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
I'mma savor it
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
I remember when
(Reaper)

You came to take me away
So close I was to heaven's gates
But no baby, no baby, not today
Oh, you tried to track me down
You followed me like the darkest cloud
But no baby, no baby, not today
(Reaper) Oh reaper
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today
(Reaper) Oh reaper
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today

So come back when I'm good to go
I got drinks to drink, and men to hold
I got good things to do with my life, yeah
Oh, I wanna dance in the open breeze
Feel the wind in my hair, hear the ocean sing
I got good things to feel in my life, yeah

Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
I'mma savor it
Don't come for me today
I'm feeling good
I remember when
(Reaper)

You came to take me away
So close I was to heaven's gates
But no baby, no baby, not today
Oh, you tried to track me down
You followed me like the darkest cloud
But no baby, no baby, not today
(Reaper) Oh reaper
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today
(Reaper) Oh reaper
(Reaper) Oh no baby, no baby, not today

Lonely float got in the way
You are the feel, and knew it anyway
Take a chance, it wasn’t what you know
Take my hand, and don’t let go

Oh, ooh ooooh
You can do it
Don’t break
Yeah, you’ll pull through it
You’re safe
Yes, you can do it
Don’t break
Yeah, you’ll pull through it
You’re safe

Tell her on how you feel
Give her every say she needs to hear
Give your heart, and say come take it
And she will see you’re a good man

Oh, ooh ooooh
You can do it
Don’t break
Yeah, you’ll pull through it
You’re safe
Yes, you can do it

Don’t break
Yeah, you’ll pull through it
You’re safe
Yes, you can do it
Don’t break
Yeah, you’ll pull through it
You’re safe---

Put on my best dress 
I wanted to impress 
I put a little makeup on 
Put a bow in my hair 
Wore pretty underwear 
Hoping you might take it off 
Don’t know if you really care 
But I’m strapped to my chair 
And it ain’t cause you’re pretty 
You were charming 
Until you saw your chance to kill 
Your chance to make history 

You went straight for the knife 
And I prepared to die 
Your blade, it shines 
Looked me straight in the eye 
You turned the gas on high 
Held the flame alight 
You wonder why I'm scared of fire 
You wonder why you make girls cry 

My mascara a mess 
Harsh words for your princess 
Boy, you and your promises 
If your goal was to love 
You scored an epic miss 
Now you'll just have memories 

You went straight for the knife 
And I prepared to die 
Your blade, it shines 
Looked me straight in the eye 
You turned the gas on high 
Held the flame alight 
You wonder why I'm scared of fire 
You wonder why you make girls cry 

Boy, you draw me back in 
Hungry for your bad loving 
But will someone find me swinging from the rafters 
From hanging on your every word 

You went straight for the knife 
And I prepared to die 
Your blade, it shines 
Looked me straight in the eye 
You turned the gas on high 
Held the flame alight 
You wonder why I'm scared of fire 
You wonder why you make girls cry---

All smiles, I know what it takes to fool this town
I'll do it 'til the sun goes down and all through the night time
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'll tell you what you wanna hear
Leave my sunglasses on while I shed a tear
It's never the right time, yeah, yeah

I put my armor on, show you how strong how I am
I put my armor on, I'll show you that I am

I'm unstoppable
I'm a Porsche with no brakes
I'm invincible
Yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful
I don't need batteries to play
I'm so confident, yeah, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, I'm unstoppable today

Break down, only alone I will cry out now
You’ll never see what’s hiding out
Hiding out deep down, yeah, yeah
I know, I’ve heard that to let your feelings show
Is the only way to make friendships grow
But I’m too afraid now, yeah, yeah

I put my armor on, show you how strong how I am
I put my armor on, I'll show you that I am

I'm unstoppable
I'm a Porsche with no brakes
I'm invincible
Yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful
I don't need batteries to play
I'm so confident, yeah, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, I'm unstoppable today

I put my armor on, show you how strong how I am
I put my armor on, I'll show you that I am

I'm unstoppable
I'm a Porsche with no brakes
I'm invincible
Yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful
I don't need batteries to play
I'm so confident, yeah, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, I'm unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, unstoppable today
Unstoppable today, I'm unstoppable today---

You shut me up, yeah, and you filled my cup, oh
You sailed my boat, you were my very last hope
You took my very last hope away

Oh, you, you will be loved by someone good,
Yeah, you, you will be loved by somebody good
You have been loved.

You dropped the bomb, and now you're gone.
I held you dear, you swallowed my fears,
And now I've drunk my last beer with you

Oh, you, you have been loved by someone good,
Yeah, you, you will be loved.

Oh will you ever know
That the bitterness and anger left me long ago?
Only sadness remains and it will pass, oh, oh, oh.

Yeah, you, you will be loved by somebody good,
By somebody good.---Lyrics submitted by Sheila.

Hey America
Let's turn it up
Let's check out ourselves
'Cause you know
You're never fully dressed without a smile
Though our clothes may be Chanel, Gucci
Your shoe's Crocodile
But baby,
You're never fully dressed without a smile

And if you stand for nothing
You'll fight for love
We got all we need
Got no more
You're never fully dressed without a smile
And if you stand for something
You can't roll out
If it's me you're loving
Then let it go
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile

Ready or not
Give all we've got
Yeah, you can't deny
That baby
You're never fully dressed without a smile
Don't sink the boat when you lose hope
I'll keep you alive
But baby
You're never fully dressed without a smile

And if you stand for nothing
You'll fight for love
We got all we need
Got no more
You're never fully dressed without a smile
And if you stand for something
You can't roll out
If it's me you're loving
Then let it go
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile

Now look at us
We pick it up
We set it on fire
'Cause you know
You're never fully dressed without a smile
We show it out, we're playing now
We're living the life
But baby
You're never fully dressed without a smile

And if you stand for nothing
You'll fight for love
We got all we need
Got no more
You're never fully dressed without a smile
And if you stand for something
You can't roll out
If it's me you're loving
Then let it go
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile

You're never fully dressed without a smile---
