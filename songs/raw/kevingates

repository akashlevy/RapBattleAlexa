Hello? What the deal? Bet

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’

Button start the foreign, oh my God I'm gorgeous
I just put the key inside my pocket park
It might not get to see, this a new Ferrari
Man in the mirror, how you choose to bother
Someone said they callin', I don't feel like talkin'
Everything is different returned the way I bought it
Phone be interrupting me while I'm recordin'
Phone be making women feel they unimportant
Call my dog, he say it's all the way retarded
Keep the oil cause I am not using the Foreman
Kitchen, I just finished up new performance
Hater, wish you well
I got clientele
I just got it off the scale

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’

There they go again, one of my lil friends
They don't give a damn how a nigga been
All they wanna know is what I got to give
How much did I spend? What I got to lend?
What I did and what I didn't do for them
Brick comin' in somewhere on the rim
Section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym
Rappin' bottles spin [?] I'm supplin' 10
Jumpin' out a Honda, I just got it in
Askin' what I cop, none of your concern
One day you gone learn what you tryna get
Everything on sale, goin' out of biz
Partners up in jail, gotta feed the kids
Juggin' round the city, you know what it is
Bread winner business, put that on the wrist

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’

Ring, ring, ringin' man
Find me balling hard
Come from grinding hard
Getting calling cards from your Barbie doll
When she round me she know I'm her bodyguard
Money callin' for me, baby girl I'm sorry
You just side yelling you not that important
Weight, shape her, pin you to the carpet
Smell like tarter, I'mma put you in the water
Conversation cause a lot of chips
She don't really get a lot of this
Engagin' where I'm gazin' at her hips
And ain't nobody makin' no attempts
Amazing clip, hanging, slanging dick
Maybe we can make it takin' trips
Maybe I was thinkin' too impatient
Phone ringing, hold up, what it is?

I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’---

I was trying to get it how I live
I want them dead presidents
I want to pull up, head spent
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired

Full time father, full time artist
Asked God, he said "grind harder"
Learn from every time you ever fail
If it never fail just grind smarter
Iron sharpens, you the dagger
On they hindquarters and they all acting
Rap game, I'm a pallbearer
Kill me and get a call after
First look, it was all laughter
Kevin Gates, no small matter
Made men believe what they didn't believe
Dive in the crowd, no safety harness
Got in the booth, no safety on it
Aim and I shoot for the stars
At the awards I ain't win no awards
Only meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard

I was trying to get it how I live
I want them dead presidents
I want to pull up, head spent
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired

Me and the woman I love on an a air mattress
We share a cot, my hair nappy
Couldn't afford flights, no air travel
Steal Rice Krispies like sand and gravel
Our testament to what can happen
The moment you follow your heart
Keeping the faith even when it get dark
They say give up as I tell them "get lost"
Six weeks ago I just purchased a foreign
Most likely the one that you cannot afford
Right foot on the gas
Balenciaga be accelerating, I'm doing the dash
Chick that I'm with, shorty be doing her shit
And it's okay to say that she bad
Look to the right and I give her a glance
Pray to God we don't, pray to God we don't crash

I was trying to get it how I live
I want them dead presidents
I want to pull up, head spent
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired

Only meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard
Don't play with the hustle, you eat or you starve
Don't mimic pretenders, just be who you are
Ain't never change, been like this from the start
Only meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard
Don't play with the hustle, you eat or you starve
Don't mimic pretenders, just be who you are
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired

Only meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard
Don't play with the hustle, you eat or you starve
Don't mimic pretenders, just be who you are
Ain't never change, been like this from the start
Only meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard
Don't play with the hustle, you eat or you starve
Don't mimic pretenders, just be who you are
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired

I was trying to get it how I live
I want them dead presidents
I want to pull up, head spent
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
I don't get, I don't get tired
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired

And I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
And I don't get tired
Get it, get fly, I got six jobs, I don't get tired---

Diamonds really diamonds
And I'm shining bright ‘cause I'm really grindin'
They ask me if I'm real, I say "is you serious?"
My daughter gon' love this bitch here

All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say "really really"
Got money on my mind, I say "really really"
I look like I been ballin' ‘cause I'm really ballin'
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry
They ask me if I'm lying, I say "really really"
I'm really out my mind, I say "really really"
Really really

Make 'em believe, I made 'em believe
A lyrical song writer and he can sing
Bringing in money like raking in leaves
I was just trying to get paper to sneeze
Achoo, that was a blessing
She special to you, I don't look at her special
Actually, I treat her regular
Not being seen, we not making no spectacle
Gates had her first then he gave her to Kevin
All the above we do all the et cetera
Scared of the feds, had to switch up my cellular
He talking reckless, don't call me back ever
Passing thru Gardere to holler at Glover
Shout out to Black, shout out to Cedric
Grey Monte Carlo, cocaine 911
Just hollered at Trav, I'm like the Reverend
My section ridiculous, watch where you steppin'
Pockets on indigent, can't be too careful
Steve like 'em tall and when they yellow
Working in college, fresh with low mileage
I like 'em black, pretty white teeth
Body unique, booty on fleek
Jhené Aiko, chewing her cheeks
Groceries, please, you know that was me

All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say "really really"
Got money on my mind, I say "really really"
I look like I been ballin' ‘cause I'm really ballin'
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry
They ask me if I'm lying, I say "really really"
I'm really out my mind, I say "really really"
Really really

Diving be treacherous (Swim)
Pray to God that don't nobody mess with us (Him)
Keep it strong in case anyone testing us
Right or wrong, if it's this, you don't mess with it
When yo bitch over here I don't mess with her
No detective work, I don't be questioning
Where she been, trying to read all of her messages
I don't speak on no man that's irregular
Take her phone disconnectin' her cellular
What you need that for undressin' her?
What you need that for caressin' her?
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back, go to pressin' her
Trying to see who tap first, made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings, she say we inseparable
Oyster Perpetual, it's not a replica
Mustang GT in the streets smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front, do it make me a elephant?
I really really put syrup in my beverages
Shopping in Beverly, check out my etiquette
Loving my swag, women tailor keep checking it
Carats they glisten in all of my necklaces
Feeling myself, really thought it was evident

All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say "really really"
Got money on my mind, I say "really really"
I look like I been ballin' ‘cause I'm really ballin'
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry
They ask me if I'm lying, I say "really really"
I'm really out my mind, I say "really really"
Really really---

[Intro:]
Say bro, I love you 'til death but bitch you gon hit it
Or you gonna lay on top of it

[Verse 1:]
Just got the word from above, placing my heart in this message
Evil is after your soul, people smart with deceptions
Keep the sharp observation, allowing no infiltration
Of those you let in your circle
They get the chance,they gon' hurt you
They be counting your pockets, you can tell by they comments
Incident with my car, my nigga wanted to drive it
I told him no, he flashed out, texting my phone talking violent
And told me put him in a song and he was catchin a body
God protected my body, I fear no nigga breathin
I feel David and Goliath, a hungry pack of hyaenas
Showing they teeth when I'm eating
Do it look like I'm cheesing?
Took my lick like a man
Then came home to the streets
No defeat!

[Chorus:]
When everyone's around i bet you had a ball
Killing emotional attachments with the alcohol
When every ones around i bet you had a ball
Killing emotional attachments with the alcohol
They say they love you and that for you they do anything
You find it awkward that their eyes don't say the same thing
Changing lately,beware of smiling faces
Pretending, betraying, beware of smiling faces

[Verse 2:]
These murders ware on my conscious as I take too many showers
I need a woman to hold me, help me forget all my problems
It 5 a.m in Toronto, she down here for college
She says a major psychology would both into astrology
This moscato was sweet, inhaling sticks of this broccoli
Hard to sleep on the side of me, seem too much is bothering me
Memories haunting me, jumping up out my sleep
She might say "Babe it's ok" - then put me straight back to sleep
I do this three of four times, my life on constant repeat
Reason I can't quit syrup, my anxiety be fucking with me
Every bitch I'm with, find out I ain't shit
After three weeks of just fucking with me
Its a fucked up feeling when you looking in the mirror
And everybody in the mirror pretending they fucking with me
Who fucking with me?!

[Chorus:]
When everyone's around I bet you had a ball
Killing emotional attachments with the alcohol
When every ones around I bet you had a ball
Killing emotional attachments with the alcohol
They say they love you and that for you they do anything
You find it awkward that their eyes don't say the same thing
Changing lately,beware of smiling faces
Pretending, betraying, beware of smiling faces ---Lyrics submitted by Marvin Strawder.

[Hook: Kevin Gates]
Got money, retarded
Don't want her if it don't clap when she walking
Not too pretty in the face, but she super thiiiiick
I'm just thinking with my dick
My shit dumb
I'm just thinking with my dick
My shit dumb
I'm just thinking with my dick

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Skip the line, on my mind
VIP going mad
Bandz a make her dance
With a bag full of zans
Got my Vans in advance
Acting bad on them tabs
Pants cost a grand
Put that ass in my hands
Duffel bag full of cash
She a model? I'mma get her
Seen 'em now
She stop, popped, and squat by the zipper
Thinking out loud
My dick probably trynna kill her
Helpin' somebody
The bitch wiped off the liqour
Going live
Long hair, shawty ride like geranimo
Sayin' I got the gas
I ain't talkin' 'bout conical
Knock the whole click down
I'm talking like dominoes
One hit wonder
When we finish, adios

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Me and this bitch ain't gon' make it to the suite
I'mma put her on her knees right here VIP
I'm a dog ass nigga, I'm not fucking with no fleas
If I saw that bitch again, I probably won't even speak
And why you taking care of that bitch?
Wait 'til you find out that we sharing that bitch
Head trippy with your girl and her girlfriend
Bet you never even knew she was a lesbian
Man that girl swallow nut like an elephant
Stupid nigga, probably thought yo bitch was celibate
Like a dentist with a drill, I be digging in they mouth
First they swallow all my children then I kick them bitches out
