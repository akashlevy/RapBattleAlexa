In a time when were spending billions of dollars in a war to control oil in Iraq, 3000 solders have come home in coffins, hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians have lost there lives, our brothers and sisters in New Orleans are left homeless and hungry. The murdered Sean Bell they murdered Ahamadoo Diago, they murdered Timothy Stansberry, and its time to say no more, no more,  no more no more no more

I got so much trouble on my mind 
Refuse to lose 
Here’s your ticket
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to black
Attack so I sat and japed 
Then slapped the Mac(intosh)
Now I’m ready to mike it 
Hear my favoritism roll oh 
Never be a brother like me go solo
Laser Anastasia maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I’m living up
X on the flex hear me now
I don’t know about later
As for now I know how to avoid the paranoid 
Man I’ve had it up to here
Gear I wear got them going in fear
Rhetoric said and 
Read just a bit ago
Not quitting they 
Signed a hard rhymer
Work to keep from getting 
Jerked changing some ways
To way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold 
Never followed a code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am God knows 
Cause its coming from the heart
What I got better get some 
Hustler of culture
Snake bitten 
Been spit in the face 
But the rhymes keep fitting 
Respects been giving how’s your living
Now I cant protect a pad off the defect
Check the record
Of reckon an intentional wreck
Played off as some intellect
Made the call took the fall 
Broke the laws
Not my fault that they falling off
Known as fair square 
Throughout my years
So I growl at the living foul
Black to the bone my home is your home 
So welcome to the terror dome

Come on down “get down” you can get it get it get it 
Come on down  huh 

There’s a hole in the apple the apple has been rotten 
Scheme like the Klan I play them like BinLaddin 
Supreme screen writer slick script editor 
Drop the LP and it hit like Hesballah 
7 yrs. Later it’s the year of the gods 
The United States Government is just a façade 
The Catholic Church got Ties with the Mob 
I see it all like the Wizard of OZ 
There is a yellow brick road to fame which is a con
If you only had a brain you would know who you are
Poison your ventilation 
Cut your education 
Secret information, 
World domination 
Take over reservations 
Tickle energies in the ocean for tsunami’s to control the population
Eyes in the sky hidden observation if you oversee to far they take away your meditation like
Give me that
Form a line 
Go to war
Press rewind
So when I get mad I put it all on a pad 
And give you something that you never had 
Controlling your fear of high rolling 
God bless your soul and keep living 
Black to the bone my home is your home 
Now welcome to the terror dome.---Lyrics submitted by william.
