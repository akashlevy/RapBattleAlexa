Yea, Ay, Ay, Ay, alright
Alright, Toomp, man
This what the fuck they been waitin' on, I guess (That's right)
Let's give it to 'em, baby (Ay, Grand Hustle, nigga)
Ay, man, they been waitin' on this shit since what you know, huh? (Yeah, it's the king, bitch!)
Well, aight, my nigga
The wait is over nigga! (Hey, hey!)

One for the money, two for the show, dog
Three for the niggas hatin' on the low, y'all
Know a picture's worth a million words, I'ma show y'all
Death before dishonor, family before all
Without the braids, I'm the closest thing to O-Dog
Minus the testimony, say it ain't so, homie!
Hey, shawty like that, don't he?
World hopped off my jock, I got him right back on it (Oh)
Stepped back, brushed myself off
Picked business back up right where I left off
I can show my dope, that other guy just talk
Ay, where I live just as big as your projects, dog
Ay, ha ha, better check my swagger
How I walk, how I talk, how I stack that cheddar
What I drive, how I dress, nigga let's just bet a
Hundred stacks on that, nigga I'm just better
Somebody better tell 'em, mane
They swag owe my swag everything
Very plain to see you study me awful hard
To the point that my swag need a bodyguard
I'd like to thank to thank you, cousin
Oh, and y'all oughta be havin' ya'll swag sendin' mines an apology
A lot of little me's I see, got beef?
What's the possibility? Stop, see, you not me
Hardly worth a hill of beans, step up to the guillotine
Get decapitated, don't see how half of you rappers made it
Say goodbye to the fame and the fortune, c'est la vie
What the game need wit' you, nigga? They got me
I ride through the city so clean, seat really low
Auto-mo-biel-lies so pretty, but I'm Illy, though
No comparison, ain't a nigga more thorough than
This gangsta American flow, doper than heroin
King like Evelyn "Champagne," man
So deranged and belligerent, ranked up there with Benjamin
Who? Andre 3K, B.I.G., Jay-Z, UGK, Scarface, Makaveli the great, Wayne, Common, Kanye and
Lupe, so fuck what you say
You welcome to ask who you may
Bet they say as of today
I'm back on top like a toupee
All objections overruled, it's overdue
Both high and sober too, I'm so high up over you
Same guy you see in the streets is as fly as here in the booth
So don't be surprised when you meet me to see I'm really the truth
Ooh, so uncouth, nigga, who want proof?
Must agree that shit I did, can't no one undo
I stay on my 1-2, nigga who want to
Turn a brunch into a brawl? Do what you gon' do
I'm why it's hot as a bitch in here
Still cool as a Frigidaire
This year I'm on a mission, dear
Think that was somethin,' listen here!---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.

(feat. Young Thug)

We got London on da Track

Bustin' out the bando
A nigga jewelry real metal like a can opener
I went from rags to riches to a feature with Tip
I went from Smart Car to a bitch with some smart lips
And the F&N make my hip limp
I'm goin' fishin' with these little bitty shrimp dips
And my bank roll got a big dip
She gon' bring it on a big ship
Quite trill, no Quik Trip
I got drugs in the alley, no tip there
She just wanna have a good day
Smoke way more weed than a guy in L.A
I want them birds 'til next May
Never let em fly away
What!? I heard, aye
Listen what my nigga Tip say

If it ain't about the money
Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up
If it ain't about the money
Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time
If it ain't about the money
Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit
If it ain't about the money
Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it

I pack an 11, I pack an 11
I ride in a gator, my shoes are Guiseppe
I'm slime like the reverend, I shoot at the reverend
Pants out the grocery store, they stuck with lettuce
She try make the extras, I told on these bitches
When it's bout time to pay I'ma bail on these bitches

Ay what you think we in the neighborhood for?
Standin' at the corner store with a pocket full of dough
I’ll be damned if a nigga wife a hood ho
Learned that from UGK back in "Pocket Full of Stones"
Put your money down, I could buck a hard 4
You playin' with it, I'ma send 'em through your car door
My watch flooded, shit sick, got Parvo
I'm doin' it for black and yellow, free Hardo
The head honcho, nigga no Tonto, nigga
I'm quick to put some bricks in a Bronco, nigga
Niggas talk shit, well I don't respond to no nigga
No murder, no dough, no convo

If it ain't about the money
Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up
If it ain't about the money
Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time
If it ain't about the money
Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit
If it ain't about the money
Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it

I pack an 11, I pack an 11
I ride in a gator, my shoes are Guiseppe
I'm slime like the reverend, I shoot at the reverend
Pants out the grocery store, they stuck with lettuce
She try make the extras, I told on these bitches
When it's bout time to pay I'ma bail on these bitches

Ay what you think we in the neighborhood for?
Standin' in the trap, slangin' good blow
Maybach used to slang that crack
Buy a stolen car while he bang that AK
If you ever took a loss better bring that back
Catcha' witcha' betcha' heat will blow your brains bout that
Know you better be, on your best behavior when addressing me
Byegones, we don't let em be
Niggas disrespect me, I'm a catch a felony
If you listen I can get you paid
But not interested in shit you say

If it ain't about the money
Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up
If it ain't about the money
Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time
If it ain't about the money
Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit
If it ain't about the money
Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it

I pack an 11, I pack an 11

[T.I. - Verse 1]
Okay we walk off in this bitch
Ballin’ in this bitch
Hoppin’ out of Lambos and Ferraris in this bitch
Poppin’ bottles with a thick red super model bitch
They may talk a lot of that but they cant do alot of this
Ay, Rico told me turn the lights on
So I grab the Audemar and threw the ice on
I’ma big dawg, got em pissed off
A lot of niggas rapping, ain’t none this raw
They like, eh look at T.I., ballin’ in the V.I.
Bunch of bad bitches with a looking like Aaliyah
We just pull up, hop out
Go in, show out
Buy the whole bar, pop bottles go hard

[Hook]
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
This club so packed, these hoes so drunk
I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt

Ball, Ball, Ball, Ball
Ball, Ball, Ball, Ball
Ball, Ball, Ball, Ball

I got a bottle, got a model, got a molly, got a blunt

[T.I. - Verse 2]
The club full of bad bitches and they came to play
Okay it must be your hair cause it ain't your face
Now if you looking for them bottles and them stacks girl
You make your way up to my section where it’s at girl
Okay do you wanna kick it with a nigga with a meal ticket
Broke nigga looking mad, they just gotta deal with it
Get right hoe, roll a dice hoe
And oyu ain't gotta be a dyke cause you like hoe
But everyday I step behind a wall
I do it big, ride fly, stunt, shine and ball
I got a bunch of money, so come and get it from me
And a bucket full of bottles, buss it open
If you wanna get drunk

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne - Verse 3]
Ain’t no nigga like a Young Money nigga
Pop that pussy like a gun, pull the trigger
Shake that ass like a salt shaker
I keep a L lit up like an elevator
Bitch shake it like a dog, hop like a frog, ride it like a horse
I throw that dick like darts
Drink all muddy, flag all bloody
I’m killin’ these hoes like that nigga Ted Bundy
I’m a good looking rapper, I ain’t tryna stunt
Ima fire my blunt like Donald Trump
Where you at hoe? Where you at hoe?
Can a nigga stick key up in ya back door
Tunechi

[Hook]

[T.I.]
And do ya thing in slow motion like Soulja Slim
And come around, wipe me down like Boosie dem
That thang up for me, show me that you love me
If it’s really too much for you you can bring a couple buddies
Everyday I do my thang, big stones and chains
She let me drill all in her mouth, no novacane
Them other broke niggas, all they did was told ya thangs
I could get ya on that G4 and show ya thangs
I like my women fat, ass pretty toes and thing
Long hair don't care as long as none down there
If its manicured I can have fun down there
Take you to whatever club throw some money in the air

[Hook]---Lyrics submitted by Jana Felder.

Do it [3x] what u waiting for 
Do it [3x] what u waiting for 
Do it [3x] what u waiting for 
Now Lemme hear you say 
Big Things poppin' and little things stoppin' [3x] 
Ball on these suckas shorty Loser's not an option 

Do it to the maximum, take it why you asking them? 
Don't listen to them suckas when they say you too irrational. 
See I said im king and them lames started laughing 
Same sucker now I want the king on the track 
I composed several classics

Bring em out, and what you know about that 
Now they ask how I talk what you know about that 
Dominated '06, now Im going right back 
See me reign hell, at a show just like that 
Even Denzel'll say damn, I ain't know it like that 
Yeah, still bankhead you can tell 
Ain't nothing changed but the name on the mail 
Still kicking doors with them thangs in the air 
up in benihanas, see me slang in dem chair 
will slang , no such thang as a jail 
Said you need a hundred squares they just came off the scale 

[Chorus] 

Do it like a ball playa, when you see me ballin 
Stacks tall- ball playa from the stage to the air 
Whether in Miami, Cincinnati or in Riverdale 
Arizona, California, make it rain anywhere 
Pullin that in public shorty who you think u finna scare? 
I send a missiles at ya have ya going in your underwear 
I tote a pair, fortyz on me, so you better tone it down 
I suggest you juss prepare yourself for when it goin down 
A-town, west side club, you should catch me, 
Right up at the top where Big Kuntry, Dro & Mac be 
Jackers lying say they caught me slipping how could that be 
I'm something like a stalker I be everywhere the strap be 
The trap be, jumping with that 100 dollar slab 
If I wanted I could get 100 on the tab 
Sell em all double down do the math 
Think I won't pull up in something With 200 on the dash 

[Chorus] 

Do it like I wanna do it, do it right in front of you 
Real vision pimpin I aint seeing none of you 
I Do it for my partner phil daughter and his momma too 
Do it for my oldest sons and they Grand momma too 
Do it for my daughters and my youngest son momma who 
go buy what she want becuz she know it ain't a problem to. 
You do something to them and its you I bring the Drama to 
You do it for a day or so, we do it for a month or two 
I do it for my partner go make show them stuntin too 
We do it with them plakas(?), aint no problem where you running to? 
We do it for the block, that why ain't nobody stopping me 
I do it for my pop, and my cousins too they watchin me 
I did it nonstop, now see how these rapper copy me 
I made it from the bottom to the top, where I oughtta be 
Who do it did good, and do it different 
No matter what I do you know I do it to death---Lyrics submitted by Sabrina.

[Chorus 2x:]
Do it [3x] what you waiting for

Big shit popping, and little shit stopping [3x]
Ball on these niggas being broke is not an option

Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone dead and gone
Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone dead and gone eeyy

Verse 1 (T.I.)
Ever had one of dem days u wish woulda stayd home
Run into a group of ni&&as getting they hate on
U walk by they get wrong u reply then sh*t get blown
Way outta proportion way past discussion
Just u against them, pick one then rush em
Figure you'd get jumped hell thats nothing
They dont wanna stop there now they bussin
Now u gushin, ambulance rushin u to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus ya hit 4 times plus it hit ya spine paralyzed waist down now ya wheel chair bound
Nevermind that now u lucky to be alive, Just think it all started u fussin with 3 guys
Now ya pride in the way but ya pride is the way u could *uck around get shot die anyday
Ni&&as die every day all over bull sh*t dope money dice game ordinary hood sh*t
Could this be cuz of hip hop music or did the ones with the good sense not use it
Usually ni&&as dont kno what to do when their back against the wall so they just start shootin
For red or for blue or for blo I guess, from Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now im straight, now I get it now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my familys sake
That part of me left yesterday the heart of me is strong today
No regrets im blessed to say the old me dead and gone away.

Chorus
Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long

The old me is dead and gone dead and gone dead and gone
Ooooooo I ve been travelin on this road to long

The old me is dead and gone dead and gone eeyy

Verse 2 (T.I.)
I aint never been scared, I lived through tragic
Situations coulda been dead lookin back at it
Most of that sh*t didnt even have to happen
But u dont think about it when u out there trappin
In apartments hangin smokin and rappin
Ni&&as start sh*t didnt next thing ya kno we cappin
Get locked up then didnt even get mad
Now think about damn what a life I had
Most of that sh*t look back just laugh
Some sh*t still look back just sad
Maybe my homboy still be around
Had I not hit the ni&&a in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my ni&&a walkin out that door
Whoda thought Id never see Philant no more
Got enough dead homies I dont want no more
Cost a ni&&a his job, cost me more
Ida took that ass-whoopin now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A ni&&a put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there talk sh*t all night
Cuz I hit you , you sue me,
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?
No more stress, now im straight, now I get it now I take
Time to think before I make mistakes just for my familys sake
That part of me left yesterday the heart of me is strong today
No regrets im blessed to say the old me dead and gone away.

Verse 3 (J.T.)
I turn my head to the east I dont see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north, swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone, the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the east I dont see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north, swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone, the new me will be alright

Chorus

[Intro - T.I. talking]
As you see the O.G.s from Grand Hustle done laid it down again
T.I.P. shawty
Hey yo, this for all my homegirls like to see a baller do his thing
Get ya shit together come on
All the eight, nines, and dimes
I'd like to welcome y'all to the best time of ya life
Ya understand that
All the stones is real
And it's all chrome on the wheels, ya know
Anything less is uncivilized

[Verse 1 - T.I.]
Pull up to the club, lift both doors up
Hopped out clean and yo ho chose us
Walked in the door, make the show hold up
Cause my neck and my bracelet is so froze up
The kind of stones bitches wanna see close up
So we don't appraoch them, they come and appraoch us
Roll the dro up then go post up
Look down with the west fixin' go sho' nuff
In the V.I.P. and all eyes on us
Hoes chill, poppin' pills blowin' dro no dust
What cha say, got a man so what
I don't know him baby and he don't know her
I got a new Phantom and my own chauffeur
Ya think ya fixin' be thinkin' bout him, no sir
Probably prefer to tel ya man good night
Unless you don't wanna know what the good life look like

[Hook - Lil' Kim, T.I.]
[Lil' Kim]
If you ain't gettin' money good night
I know what a broke nigga look like
When ya ridin' in ya wheels get ya shit together
Boy them diamonds ain't real, get ya shit together
[T.I.]
Now we can ball seven days, six nights
If tht head and that pussy hit right
Hey, match ya panties with ya bras get ya shit together
Go get ya hair and nails done get ya shit together

[Verse 2 - T.I.]
Hey, I'm off the scene with Louis the thirteenth
Chains swings to my jeans, and my T-shirt clean
In case you been researching, I'm the King
With a style as mean as the Earth seem
Chest on ice, and my wrist on gleam
30 karats in the ring, money ain't no thing
You think I'm playin' but I ain't joking
The dro king, if it ain't purple, I ain't smoking
Rubberband bank rolls, fifty thousand dollar cheddar knots
Try to shine, is you out your mind, boy you better not
I walk around with more money than you ever got
Shrewd attitude like I never had to sell a rock
Shawty I can get you in whatever spot
Backstage, front row, what I got to front for
I'm getting bored, don't even know what I stunt for
Got a lot of rides, what it hurt to cop one more

[Hook - Lil' Kim, T.I.]

[Verse 3 - T.I.]
To all my hot girls, if you wanna come chill
Or roll on chrome wheels, let me tell you what it is
We fixin' throw a little party at the crib
Where the floors tricked out and the rooms like ill
The basement's cool, but the pools unreal
Where that millionaire lives, shit remains concealled
So pop a pill, put on your blindfold
I'm hitting the dance floor, and grab eighty-nine more
Let em' know we on the way where they been trying to go
I knew I had em' when they asked me "What kind of diamonds are those"
Headed to the spot pouring double shots of XO
Play the "Love Below" ane watch'em undress slow
Flicks on the flat screen, make em' want to "Get Low"
And spit shine this dick of mine until it gets swole
When they kick it with the king, they don't wanna let go
So whatcha gonna tell a nigga, when he tell ya "Let's Go"

[Hook x2 - Lil' Kim, T.I.]---Lyrics submitted by C.J.

Come and get yo girl
Cause shawty so ugghh
Looking like trash i ain't saying nothing to her
Come and get your girl
Ey shawty can't stay
We brought real women and she all in they way

Hey shawty really come and get yo chick
She on me like the horses on polo
In here tryin to get a photo
Please come do somthin with yo...
I rather leave solo
Cause she ain't even so-so
What the fuck she got on they ain't air vs on her logo
When she with me she got a green light
She more like a no go
She could'ntride with me in my two seater or in my photo
She aiming at the star tryin to holla at it
What she thinkin bout i got elevated figure
Man they took the car money in the bank
Black a mile smoke her breath so stank
I came in the club swag sharper than the shank
Then she throwin ass at my head bigger than a tank

Come and get yo girl
She all in my space
Backing her ass all in my face
Come and get yo girl
Cause shawty won't leave
How could she be... When she all on me
Come and get yo girl
Cause shawty so ugghh
Looking like trash i ain't saying nothing to her
Come and get your girl
Ey shawty can't stay
We brought real women and she all in they way
Come and get yo girl---Lyrics submitted by katrina.

[T.I. Intro]

[Chorus: Keri Hilson & T.I.]
I got your back boy
We were high
We were low
but I promise I will never let you go
said I got I got I got I got your back boy
I got I got I got I got your back boy
(I know you got my back right)
keep my swagger
keep it looking good for ya
keep it looking hood for ya
shawty if you don’t know
I got I got I got I got your back boy

[T.I. Verse 1]
Hey it’s whatever shawty
you ain’t gotta ask
yes Valentino blouses, summer houses, cash, check!
you can get it you deserve it, flawless diamonds, Louie purses,
my mission’s to purchase Earth for her
present the gifts without the curse
her pleasure is my purpose
pleasure to be at your service
front row at fashion shows as well as Sunday morning service
but better days or for worse
if I’m paid I’m hurting in my pocket
she still got a n-gga back that’s for sure
no matter what may occur in life
everyday with her is like a plus
I’mma love her til she be like that’s enough
pop a bottle get a couple wine glasses fill em up and lift em up
let us toast to the future here’s to us
no, here’s to her

[Keri Hilson - Bridge]
They wonder how we do what we do
Panamera Porsches me and you
stuck to your side like like like glue
be by your side whatever your gonna do

[Chorus]

[T.I. Verse 2]
This is for the women who man caught a sentence
who gon be there for a minute but they didn’t keep their distance
they stayed home waiting on the phone
and on visit day show up looking good smelling better, playing kissy face
just wanna let you know we appreciate
everything you do for us on a day to day
and I know we don’t show you all the time but we lucky that you ours
no bouquet of flowers could ever show how much we know we need you
we do all that’s in our power just to please you
see boo, f-ck them girls I would leave the World ‘fore I leave you
may God say even now (…)

[Bridge]
[Chorus]

[T.I. Verse 3]
Sure enough
even though them chicks be hating on us
still I’m gonna keep her by my side
In whatever situation we gon ride
make all my fantasies come alive
that’s no lie now
I’ll be (…) as long as your gon be beside me
10 million dollar mansions won’t suffice
if you ain’t gon be in there with me at night
the pieces to my puzzle’s in my life
with all of my good days and all of my bad
you stood by your man and you know you got my back
worth every car every bag with me they wanna be that
I know what I got at home
I ain’t never gon leave that
them b-tches best believe that

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.

Aye, have you ever loved somebody so much you can't stand it but can't do without 'em?
Do anything for 'em cause you truly do adore 'em
Like dedicate songs, write poems
But they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore 'em
But you feel like they feel like you ain't right for 'em
Therefore your heart's torn
Between being with 'em forever, leaving 'em never
But it seem like you argue and fighting over whatever
Maybe we can leave, find someone better
Even though you will, you never known none better
My heart says nah, she can't leave, won't let her
Been head over heels since the very day I met her
Fell so deep in love I ain't been able to get up
Sometimes I want some peace of mind and she don't shut up
Love her to death, don't know whether to kiss her or kill her

Should've known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we pray but
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

And we don't know which one to choose
But either way, we're gonna lose
Still we pray but
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

Hah, I guess I'd rather suffer with her than be miserable without her
I buy alot of Prada, Gucci, and Belinciaga
To keep her content, and keep down the nonsense
But every corner we turn, around the conflict
Mostly dumb shit, like who she run with?
Where the fuck have you been? Them pants – they don't fit
Really, honestly speaking, some things I don't get
No matter how much she try she can't make it make more sense
Therefore, here we go again
Screaming, yelling at the top of our lungs, she going in
Seeing the kind of shit I be like if you was a man
I would go in your shit, real, no shit
But I love her so much that I can't forget
That the feel of a kiss, it could heal when I'm sick
Still, I don't like to feel like this
If I wouldn't miss her, I would probably to get a kill right here

Should've known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we pray but
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

And we don't know which one to choose
But either way, we're gonna lose
Still we pray but
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

Every time we say our goodbyes
A little piece of my heart breaks off inside
I don't really ever know why
If I could live without you I'd try

Should've known it
From the start it was already over
We were just too dumb to notice
And we pray but
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses

And we don't know which one to choose
When either way, we're gonna lose
Still we pray but
Even love couldn't save us
We wake up
On a bed of guns and roses---Lyrics submitted by lee.

It’s the king representing once more, you understand. When people see me on Bankhead man on four star point, yelling screaming and waving. I don’t wanna roll over no toes in my Rolls. You just back up let a pimp pass through you dig?

Baby better double arthur burger
Every time I see shorty
Where your head tonight
Selling out arenas chasing asses like Serena
Shorty live a hell of a life

I’m shining in and out of foreign
Cars never boring
Cash steady flowing they got shorty where you goin?
People see me they ask me shorty where you goin?
Partners see me they ask meshorty where you goin?

Shorty goin extra hard when they release his passport
Why I need a credit card what you think this cash for?
Hit the dealership and give them every dime he ask for
Just so I can see 260 on the gas board

Trying to get some luck somebody better get the task force
Love when hoes love me let me fuck em til their ass hoarse.
Pimpin 101 just come and see me take a crash course
You wanna count my money go to college need a math course

On a main dashboard, 100 milligramy
Breakneck speed til I see a billi coming.
I’m building jimi hendrix good grumbling in my stomach

I’m still stunting off the chain chasing niggas for my money
Pair of poodles ike I’m playing gin rummy
No cards just broads when a nigga get hard
Love the offshore autobahn tar like a car star
Put it in her wristwatch
Balling like a big shot

Baby better double arthur burger
Every time I see shorty
Where your head tonight
Selling out arenas chasing asses like Serena
Shorty live a hell of a life---Lyrics submitted by chantel.

[T.I - Chorus]
I never let you down I’ma shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off mine alright
Hard Imma ball on them squares I float
Quarter million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may see it might be
But no matter what they doing they don’t do it like me
Like a G I hold it down for the town I’m at
And I flash like that
Recognise I’M BACK!
Strike a match catch a fire

[Verse 1]
Any moment I decide thats enough of all your lies
Noy your buzz just died
Step inside super fly to the shoes in their coupe
Then exit out with all the b-tches like we always do
My desire to retire growing every new coupe
Cause these guys just don’t ride like mi n-gga you too
Tight jeans, funny hair, cuz dancing on the screen
It’s about the real n-ggas in the game so it seems
Just pretending holla pimpin get a sh-t a black eye eye
Next he say he trapping in my head I’m like why
Be yourself, you aint gotta pimp on in your body
I can tell ya aint never bought a key or caught a body
N-gga probably just seen Wayne, Gucci Mane, Me and Boosie all go to prison
And they flip their whole image n-gga tripping
Listen, do for you that aint in the cars
Think the power is in your gun but over all it’s in your heart
Nowadays I don’t know wassup with n-ggas in the A
Guess he think he in the game but he really in the way
Violating, I was having conversations in the joint
But guess who done it and I promised I would put you on point
I’m disappointed in you dog you aint hold it down at all
But I aint going in your jaw just gon show ya how to ball
Standin tall thru the storm on the yard or in the dorm
Cats in prison who expecting me to represent for em

[Chorus]
I never let you down I’ma shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off mine alright
Hard Imma ball on them squares I float
T.i. I'm Back lyrics found on http://www.directlyrics.com.com/ti-im-back-lyrics.html

Like a G I hold it down for the town I’m at
And I flash like that
Recognise I’M BACK!
Strike a match catch a fire

Catch a fire see T.I add gas

Scary ass n-gga wanna come for me you better bring it
I ain’t mad I forgive em, God I know they aint mean it
Yeah I seen it all before, hey, I’m popping and they ain’t
Rack they brain try to think how to stop it and they can’t
Ain’t that lame but then that hatred manifest to pure malice
I’m no longer being callous so I’m gon let you n-ggas have it
Won’t be satifsied till somebody dies and Im patient
Waiting on me and the reaper on a first name basis now
I’mma let you make it now, stay totally out the way for you
But know that we can take it any place you wanna take it to
Hating in your blood, cuz, guess it’s just too late for you
All I could do is pray for you or organise a wake for you
Your choice, clearly I aint hearing your voice

Hey, you can the bottom partner Im gon bring the sky box

Rappin for the hell of it
Hella rich never have to sell a brick again
Must I tell a bitch again
The Bullshit I'm addressing check I'm on some next level shit
Never been fucked in the game I'm celibate
Rarely out my element,
Barely out the ghetto with
One foot out and one foot in intelligent as fellas get
Listen let's settle this
Be clear I could fall back seven years
Still ain't no one ahead of me

[Verse 1]:
Consider it a blessing if you get to stand next to me
Five star general
O.G. veteran
Caked like edimen
Blowing that celery
Stack that cash like the U.S. Treasury
Every single thing I ever done was done heavily
Rap until your seventy
Still ain't no catching me
Put it on my pops, Big Phil, Aunt Beverly
Be standing on the top still after they bury me
Nose in the air so stuck up arrogant
Ain't got long hot songs best cherish it
Whoever drop mine that's over, finito
You paying for your foul like a freethrow
Now how could a nigga think that he could see me
Other than the magazine covers or the T.V.
You know I sold more mixtapes than your cd
You’re waiting on your big break praying you can beat me
You ain't made it far as DC on the low
I been all around the globe like a god how they treat me
Broads hit they knees eyes closed when they greet me
Mouth wide open just begging me to skeet! skeet!
You in a deep sleep stop dreaming
I'm 6 albums in for 10 years I been firin' hot semen
The limelights mine I'm gleaming
Beaming
That's why I say I'm King bitch
I got my reasons

[Chorus]:
Wrist so frosty
Neck so chilly
All on my mind is to get more millies
Niggas talk shit that's silly
Shawty he ain't about that
Really? Is he?
Nigga I'm illy
Yeah! Haha haha, hey
I run this city
Clearly
Tell em get lost I’m busy really
Nigga I'm illy

[Verse 2:]
Where niggas get off, piss off
Me and mine oughta take time to pop a lid off
Shit all over the way bouncing me is y'all
Seeing your fucking mind you figuring Im'a fizz off
Never cooled off Tip scorching
Minimal injury though they wishing me maximum misfortune
Number one hands down
Flow paints portraits
Everybody think you stink like horse shit
House full of chicks on some girl next door shit
A king go on sell 30 mil out the store quit
Of course this case lost all my endorsements
Tripled up on real estate still buying more shit
But Tip bankrupt according to your sources
I'm still caked up along with more reinforcements
Tore shit up from the ladder to the rooftops
Officially the hottest nigga rapping since Tupac
Before you rap bout me best ask bout me
I'm out my fucking mind need counseling
Please don't doubt me, trust me
Drama ain't nothing
It's all fun and games till somebody start busting
Remember my discussion when rappers be battling
I find out about it better get to skedaddling
Pack your family’s bags move 'em out to Seattle
You ever crawl back you'll need an ambulance and bandages
Live life glamorous so extravagant
Mandarin, oriental worldwide traveling
Hip hop champion for real though
You couldn’t fuck with me with a Brazil hoe nigga
But still though,

[Chorus (x2)]:
Wrist so frosty
Neck so chilly
All on my mind is to get more millies
Niggas talk shit that's silly
Shawty he ain't about that
Really? Is he?
Nigga I'm illy
Yeah! Haha haha, hey
I run this city
Clearly
Tell em get lost I’m busy really
Nigga I'm illy---Lyrics submitted by young.

Put your sweet fingers
A little closer to the keyboard
It's hard to read between your lines
We were the clock hands at midnight
Now you're four whole hours behind

Just put your fingers
A little closer to the keyboard
I can't quite see the whites of your eyes
Though you bat your eyelids from across the ocean
And I fall over in their breeze

I don't bring you spices from the East
And I don't bring you the world's you crave
'cause everyday you need a new one

Just like Mr. Benn
Just like Mr. Benn
Just like Mr. Benn

Put your sweet fingers
A little closer to the keyboard
We pass light bits in the night
Though you send your flare to the horizon
I just stare and blink in your light

No, I don't speak in all your tongues
So I don't even know if I'll be welcome
What if I appeared as if by magic?
Just like in Mr. Benn

Just like Mr. Benn
Just like Mr. Benn

So go if you're going
You keep pouring when I say when
Come home when your work there is done
Just like, just like

Just like Mr. Benn
Just like Mr. Benn
Just like Mr. Benn
Just like Mr. Benn

Just put your fingers
A little closer to the keyboard
It's hard to read between your lines
We were the clock hands at midnight
Now you're four whole hours behind---Lyrics submitted by Brightone.

[Verse 1]
My cousin Toot aint have to die right in front of his son and his wife
He lost his life struggling over a gun

If I catch em Imma kill em I made it my bizness
back in the day you stayed in my bizness taught I didnt have to corporate yay in my bizness
coincedently that's why today you not wit me
my cousin died ova some yay and I miss em
plus he had his family out let's say she the eye witness
but her boyfriend did the shooting judge gave her life sentence
I heard that now Im dressed up in all black
shot up the whole apartments and still and brought back
the best friend I had in Jamel I lost that
I guess your death was a lesson in life it taught me that

[repeat chorus]

[Verse 2]
Who ever seen a nigga go to jail sleep til day two
well thats how sick I was when Jay blew

daughter she smile just like you
so cute even resorts to violence like you

loose but ha what can you do
and I got 4 myself yep it's been a few
now everything I do is for
King, messiah, dazasha, demonte
lord they all I got so please don't take em from me

trap wit corin and sir kap

dough and a little crack

[repeat chorus]

[Verse 3]
I bet you niggas thinking that I living it up

Went from seeing how many bitches i can fit in the truck

many millions I got nigga so what if Im hot when I got prices on my head
Feds rushing my spot a million
haters wont me dead force to carry me gat
but you a seven time felon wat you doing with dat
It's a catch
22 either you lose or lose
Thats the way the game structured for real niggas to suffer
and I aint never
been a busta alway stood on my feet
like a man prepared to take what ever coming for me
a pussy nigga
or polices wit a warrant for me
Im a "G" prepared to die for whats important to me
Look anybody in the
eye who say they want it wit me
put up the house and bet the odds if coming from me
OG's say I need to
learn and be patient
you telling me wit these seven years of probation
pistol charges and a host of
other open cases
if niggas only knew the kind of time I was facing
I tried to keep to myself but
sometime I couldnt take it
got 4 kids wit smiles on they faces
mean more to me than my crown and my braclet
take that away from me and my life is butt naked

(Rihanna): 
You're gonna be a shining star, in fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars. 
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far, 
Cause everyone knows, just who you are-are. 
So live your life (Ay!), ay ay ay. 
You steady chasing that paper, 
Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay. 
Ain't got no time for no haters
Just live your life (Ay!), ay ay ay. 
No telling where it'll take ya, 
Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay. 
Cause I'm a paper chaser, 
Just living my life (Ay!), my life (Oh!), my life (Ay!), my life(Oh!), 
just living my life (Ay!), my life (Oh!), my life (Ay!), my life(Oh!), 
just living my life 

Nevermind what haters say, ignore them 'til they fade away. 
Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away. 
Safe to say I paved the way, for you cats to get paid today. 
You'd still be wasting days away, not had I never saved the day. 
Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay. 
Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way. 
I never been a hater still I love them in a crazy way. 
Some say they sold yay and no they couldn't get work on Labor day. 
It aint that black or white, their hands in areas the shade of grey. 
I'm West side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away.
Some move away to make a way not move away cause they afraid. 
I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away. 
I pray for patience but they make me want to melt their face away.
Like I once made them spray, now I could make em put the k's away.
Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break. 
If you ever see me catch a case, and watch my future fade away. 

(Rihanna): 
You're gonna be a shining star, in fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars. 
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far, 
Cause everyone knows, just who you are-are. 
So live your life (Ay!), ay ay ay. 
You steady chasing that paper, 
Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay. 
You got no time for no hata's 
Just live your life (Ay!), ay ay ay. 
No telling where it'll take ya, 
Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay. 
Cause I'm a paper chaser, 
Just living my life 

(T.I.): 
I'm the opposite of moderate, immaculately polished with the spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid. 
Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics. 
Articulate but still I'd grab a nigga by the collar quick. 
Whoever having problems with their record sales just holla 'tip 
If that don't work and all else fails, then turn around and follow 'tip. 
I got love for the game but ay, I'm not in love with all of it. 
Could do without the fame and the rappers nowadays are comedy. 
The hootin' and the hollerin', back and forth with the arguing. 
Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in. 
Seems as though you lost sight of whats important when depositing them checks into your bank account and you up out of poverty. 
Your values is in disarray, prioritizing horribly. 
Unhappy with the riches cause you piss poor morally. 
Ignoring all prior advice and fore warning. 
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we? 

(Rihanna): 
You're gonna be a shining star, in fancy clothes, and fancy car-ars. 
And then you'll see, you're gonna go far, 
Cause everyone knows, just who you are-are. 
So live your life (Ay!), ay ay ay. 
You steady chasing that paper, 
Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay. 
You got no time for no hata's 
Just live your life (Ay!), ay ay ay. 
No telling where it'll take ya, 
Just live your life (Oh!), ay ay ay.

Man of Respect on a big jet
With a big big and a big check
I pop big sh-t how good does it get
Ya leave me, where else you think you could get this?
Yeah, you could get another guy to beat that beat that for ya
Them busters cowards though, and I’ll take a bullet for you
Mansions, jewelry all I need is for you and me to have some understanding
Have a couple candid conversations
Your frustrations I take in consideration
I’m rough around the edges, don't bat with me and be patient
And you’re sadly mistaken if you think I’m into chasing
My heart is RSVP I’ve extended an invitation
And don't go wasting your time with what they saying online
Your positions divine, don’t believe look around
I got a strong mind and kind heart
With a soft kiss but I love heart

[Chorus]

Don’t nobody do you like me

You you know you love this life
Don’t nobody do you like me

[Bridge]
Don’t you love this life like I love you
Anything you could ask, do it for you
Drop Jags, Berkin bags, Louboutin heels
Summer homes in Miami, hollywood hills
Vacation in Monaco
On the French Riviera with our feet up
Our lifestyles so rare, you know you ain't going no where

[Chorus]
You know, You know you know you love this
You know you love this life
Don’t nobody do you like me
You know, you love
You you know you love this life
Don’t nobody do you like me
You know ---

Hey, hey
Hey what's happenin' erry'body
I hope they get my good side
You know I gotta look good when I walk out the house
You know I know the camera's following me
I know they taking pictures, right Drama
Ay man, you watch it I live it, you dig that
Y'all sit back relax get some popcorn man
I'm gonna make it a good show, you dig that
This goin' make a hell of a movie huh

(Chorus) (Usher)
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holla (ay)
Just here for your amusement
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
You waitin' for me to lose it
I guess I'm just here for your amusement

The price of fame I think I paid, want my change I done gave
E'rry'thing in my possession for my seconds on the stage
For my name up in lights and multi-million record sales
I done gave up my life, can't get a moment to myself
When alone I ask myself, is it worth it? I ain't perfect
Neither is anybody else, but I think my kids deserve
To be with Daddy out in public without all the interruptions
When the lies and gossip's published I'm the topic of discussion
And I stay in trouble just to show these suckers I ain't lost it
And I'd do it all again that's the funny thing about it
I ain't playing, boy I'm 'bout it
Will I change, boy I doubt it
I done been a lot of things, I ain't never been a coward
See the paparazzi crowded all around me now
Same niggas who was dissin' want a pound like I'm C now
Showered with support from my adoring fans
They hear T.I.'s arrested they're like here we go again

(Chorus) (Usher)
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holla (ay)
Just here for your amusement
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
You waitin' for me to lose it
I guess I'm just here for your amusement

Ay, You've seen it all before, guys know how the story goes
It's like 2Pac never died, sit back, enjoy the show
You see the shit that scares you senseless, I done lived through it
Knew the risks and the consequences and I still do it
And then I'm so fresh, them niggas mildew it
Not just a actor by profession, pimp, I live movies
That's why they whisper when they see me, point and stare at me
'Cause they just wanna live through me vicariously
Fashion weekend, Paris week, party like a rockstar
Get blown by a top model 'til she catch lockjaw
Got the dough you get a year, stashed in my sock drawer
Showed you the troubles and the struggles of an outlaw
Top dog would not fall, I am not y'all
Couple pages out the calendar and I'm out y'all
Kid listen, pay attention, you don't wanna be me
It's safer to watch it on T.V.

(Chorus) (Usher)
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holla (ay)
Just here for your amusement
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
You waitin' for me to lose it
I guess I'm just here for your amusement

(Usher)
See I don't think it would even matter (to me)
Woking a nine to (five) would it be better
I mean be honest, would you care to gossip about me
Not likely
I guess that's just the way that it goes (the way that it goes)
('Cause I know) See I can be somewhere out keeping it cool
(And get told) Almost anything instead of the truth
Y'all know more than I do, it's breaking news to me too
Easy killer y'all know that ain't how I move (ooh)
He said and she said (what) I did what, with they (who)
No not me I said (not me) she gave me no head (ooh)
Won't get me again (hey) I pleaded the fifth (hey)
I know better than to ever talk during the film...
In' and flashing lights can blind your eyesight
To when you can't see what's wrong from right
Well shorty 'til you walk a mile in my shoes
And understand this is who I am

(T.I.)
Usher I completely concur
Life can be such a blur, obviously we prefer
Our privacy but instead we endure
Yes sir, don't expect nothin' less of me
'Cause this goin' probably be this way until the death of me
But for the hustle and the lady on my arm now
Plus all my kids and my mom's I'm a calm down
And yo, we doin' just fine, and the time's just flyin'
Live one headline at a time

(Chorus) (Usher)
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holla (ay)
Just here for your amusement
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
You waitin' for me to lose it
I guess I'm just here for your amusement---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.

rather see me in a cell in- 
stead of this new McLaren 
god'll take you through hell just to get you to heaven 
so even know its heavy the load i will carry 
grin and still bear it 
win and still share it 
apologies to the fans i hope you can understand it 
life can change ya directions 
even when you aint planned it 
all you can do is handle it 
the worst thing you could do is panic 
use it to your advantage 
avoid insanity manage to conquer 
every obstacle 
make impossible possible 
even when winnings illogical 
losing's still far from optional 
yeah they wanna see you shot up in the hospital 
but one life throw punches, block ya counter like a boxer do 
been locked inside mi casa too long 
I did a song to make it known that the king lives on 
(pimpin) 

(Chrous)

I show you how to do 
What you do 
You aint got a clue 
All you do is follow dudes 
Sound like a lot of dudes 
I weather whateva storm 
Make it out without a bruise 
I understand why 
Now wit my hands tied 
Dey take shots cause if im out there it’s a land slide 
But revenge is best served as a cold dish 
and suckas will get served better know this 
guess it was understood for me it was over with 
but I don’t quit if ya aint notice yet 
they couldn’t wait to say good night shawty 
so they can try to rhyme act and look like shawty 
go get a beat from Toomp? and make a hook like shawty 
before ya know it im back 
what it look like shawty 
I lost my partna and my daughter in the same year 
Somehow I rise above my problems and remain here 
Yeah and I hope the picture painted clear 
If ya heart filled with faith then ya cant fear 
Wonder how I face years and im still chillen 
Easy, let go and let god deal wit it 

(Chorus) 
i aint dead (naw) 
i aint done (naw) 
i aint scared (of what!) 
i aint run (from who!)

All I fuck is bad bitches
I don’t want no mediocre (x3) no
Bad bitches only
Ain't no mediocre
Don’t want no mediocre
I won’t hit no mediocre
You a bad bitch
Stuntin on the mediocre (x3)
7 bitches with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre

Right hand in the air
I solemnly swear
I never fuck a bitch if she don’t do her hair
No more, you won’t get no dick if there’s a bush down there
Girl I should see nothing but pussy when I look down there
You come fuck with a nigga what better to do
He call to ask how you doin tell him better than you, yeah
I’m kicked back with four pieces like a kit kat
Me fucking if you ain’t a dime, just forget that
Pretty face fat ass, if she don’t have
Have one of these, well I think I’ll pass
I just handed her the keys to a new drop Jag
When she took it I took it back
You shoulda asked for a Benz
That’s mediocre bitch

All I fuck is bad bitches
I don’t want no mediocre (x3) no
Bad bitches only
Ain't no mediocre
Don’t want no mediocre
I won’t hit no mediocre

[Iggy Azalea]
Heard he want to lay it down on Iggy Iggy
Gave it to him twice
Now he want a 3, Mike Bibby diva
But I need a bad boy
Rest in peace Whitney pardon me
But I don’t think none of these bitches fucking with me
Want a billboard bitch stop running in place
Heels on me saying gimme 6 inches of space
Courtside while designer frames cover my face
Now everybody in the game wanna get em a taste
I’m still Grand Hustle first lady fuck you pay me
Bet he won't go 12 rounds with the million dollar baby
I can change your life quick stop playing with me
And if you ain't talking money what you saying to me

All I fuck is bad bitches
I don’t want no mediocre (x3) no
Bad bitches only
Ain't no mediocre
Don’t want no mediocre
I won’t hit no mediocre
You a bad bitch
Stuntin on the mediocre (x3)
7 bitches with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre

I'm in Brazil with a bitch
Catch me in a mansion in the hills with a bitch
Get her out dem tennis shoes
Throw some heels on a bitch
I’m the type of nigga split a mil with a bitch
Hold up, only if she bad though
Out here trying to find someone that better than my last go
Take her to my castle
Drown her in my cash flow
Say your dick so little she can fit it in her asshole
Told me she can write this shit
No further than a cab go
Said I got that don dick
She wanna be my tutor
So she give me brain getting head on the scooter
Had sex on the beach
From Bermuda up to Cuba
I done fucked a lot of dimes
But I’m looking for a cute bitch
You the shit
What she say when she got to sit
When I ain't around
Give a damn who you do it with
Super thick pretty face
Ménage à veinte
20 at the same time
Wanna get ya rent paid

All I fuck is bad bitches
I don’t want no mediocre (x3) no
Bad bitches only
Ain't no mediocre
Don’t want no mediocre
I won’t hit no mediocre
You a bad bitch
Stuntin on the mediocre (x3)

From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.

[Chorus]
There's no mercy for me no crying myself to sleep
no mercy for me, nightmares have become my dreams
no mercy for me good morning reality, will i wake we'll
never know i'm late for my date with destiny....let me go.

let me go you've got to let me go, right or wrong
let me go i'm on my path let me go. My mama loved me 
more than i do she said your pop was jus like you.
trapped in a vicious cirlce Jesus youngest disciple tell 
the judge if he throwed the book at me make it the bible.
Start calling myself the king for lack of a better title.

Loyal beyond belief to my detriment it's so vital I 
change or blow opportunities like a choir recital. Now
while I do not care who telling meanwhile selling powder
puts food in the bellies. Well it's unfortunate the orphanage 
couldn't keep up the mortages.

Kid go to school stupid they teachers ignoring it sorta just
doomed forced into being a goon selling kush in a jar 
mixing guitar and the volume. Consumed with the same way
of life I left everything i know now learned by myself all you
see is the wealth the Maseratis Ferraris. So don't sympathise
don't nobody feel sorry no mercy.

[Chorus]

Everybody's standing and waiting chanting and hating Gospels
say they should forgive me, they rather hand me to satan
blatant displays the day of hypocrisy boy you got to be 
kidding could it possibly be second coming of Pac, is me. 
Remember that when he was there and when he died
you realised you need him here.

God with me partner ain't no one for me to fear hindsight
20/20, future not as clear but I'm a rider 'til I die put bullets 
'tween my eye. Hide your "S" I can make my peace with God
and say goodbye, fuck up the world like Lady Di on the day 
he died. His wife and sons and daughters know that everyday
he tried, to be a better person all they want is better verses.

They could market to the merchants but when they closed curtains
aye, you could be for certain ain't nobody perfect, but when 
your rich nobody gives a shit no mercy

i used to dream (i used to dream) oh whoah

man i remember before i say that wait let me issue this statement
no way should reflection be mistaking for glorification
now i remember so vivid me and my niggas was living
sub-standard condition still handling business
still laughing and tripping still having the bitches
im rapping now reminiscing and god damn it we did it
from trapping standing and pitching with rich we stand in the kitchen
splitting it eight ways flipping it 8 days
thought that while in a room it was just the way to behave
kept the weight and the yey for most the paper we made in all dimes
i aint lieing the pleasure was all mine
have big work to move but we served the small time
i always outshined the niggas with small minds
who would of thought we would be arguably the greatest of all time
around here we developed such a sound down here
but duplicate it off the steel it can only be found here
only listen to gs that other shit i dont hear
shit they so far in the rear how would i even care
im too busy being a player staring at niggas careers
but talk about it for years and now we finally here


[Chorus:]

[Ludacris:]
they say what goes up must come down but i aint reached my cruising altitude
take a look at what i did but can you imagine what im about to do
the places im bout to go and the money im bout to see
gave bill gates some binoculaurs and said look out for me
and see these expectations even at def jam
cause i married the streets and atlanta has been my best man
my momma quit her job and now she works with six figures
cause im a self-made nappy-headed rich nigga
private planes help me travel in peace
to four cities in one day and four countries in one week
cause i work for myself and no one else cause im too smart too
put one of my partners right through culinary art school
now he my personal chef so that bread he get it
put them all in houses cleaned up all of my friends credit
and now they witness all the glitz and the glamour
catch us eating at straits atlanta with women with table manners
order in singapore and lobster
celebrating coming from nothing to winning grammys and rappers winning oscars
and they say rappers shouldnt act nahh suckers
we see samuel jackson like whats up mother fuckerrr

i know them haters dont stop plotting and wish you would fall
cause im standing on top looking down at it all
i see you down there to yall this aint like i got it all
homie i aint get enough im still trying to triple up
so all we got is street cred and a cool building up
say im doing too much shit i say i aint did enough
remember saying damn if i could just get to a million plus
and now im like shit what the fuck is a million bucks
triple that on my bun thanks to bigs and run
but nevermind what ive been through just look at what i become
all the shit ive avoided what i done for my sons
hand dollars and momma just call her
i sold dope and dropped out of school seems its all they can see
they dont notice none of my family did that since me
i broke that cycle now my family live a life of
mandatory minimals but not when the judge sentence them
cousins in college where you think they get tuition from
jeffrey standing around wishing huh
and while you standing around looking dumb
i make it happen taking action over time got damn good at it

Don't do no business until you check his (paperwork)
And if all else fails, I just hope that this (paperwork)
Wanna swing Bentley doors, blow smoke through the roof
Everything got a cost, they gone need something on you
(Paperwork)

ATL, Westside, that's the only home I know
In '85, me and Uncle Quint used to ride around in the big Bronco
Took me up to Charles' Disco
Daytime, set me down at the bar
Where I drank Shirley Temple
Till he walked out with a bag and we got back in the car
What you wanna be he asked? When you grow up big head?
I just wanna be like you, ridin' round town gettin' bread
We shared a couple laughs, couple summer pass
Uncle Quint ain't nowhere to be found
Later we learn that someone ratted him out
For that reason 10 years he won't be around

(Paperwork)
Don't do no business until you check his (paperwork)
And if all else fails, I just hope that this (paperwork)
Wanna swing Bentley doors, blow smoke through the roof
Everything got a cost, they gone need something on you
(Paperwork)

Picture me in '93
I'm the only man I see
Fresh up off the porch
Lookin' for a drop Porsche and a fake ID
Introduce me to the crack game
Rap game was the furthest from my mind
Had a notebook full of rhymes
And a pocket full of crack rock dimes
Time on my side, lil .45 in my jeans
Open fire if you seem to be blocking my dreams, yessir
Welfare, food stamps
Section 8, me and Ma lived in the trap
I said fuck school, it holdin' me back
I wanna bankroll, chasin' after that

(Paperwork)
Don't do no business until you check his (paperwork)
And if all else fails, I just hope that this (paperwork)
Wanna swing Bentley doors, blow smoke through the roof
Everything got a cost, they gone need something on you
(Paperwork)

Look at me, at 17
Livin' on my own, peddlin'
Quarter ki, now and then sellin' weed
Totin' tools, caughtt my first felony
That's one of many, that were to follow
Drinkin' Henney up out the bottle
Tote a choppa I think I'm bein' followed
Family don't think I'll live to see tomorrow
Plenty have a story like mine
Know many of you had a little nine
Know many of you did a little dirt
Too many of us did a little time
Wake up, 10 years of your life passed
When you get your cake up
Don't it seem lil' odd
When the Feds on your ass passin' out

(Paperwork)
Don't do no business until you check his (paperwork)
And if all else fails, I just hope that this (paperwork)
Wanna swing Bentley doors, blow smoke through the roof
Everything got a cost, they gone need something on you
(Paperwork)

If you think that you high, baby look above you
It's drones in the sky, there's nothing you could do
So left, two, three snap
Right two, three snap
Don't get serious now it's too late for that
'Cause they got
Time on my side, lil .45 in my jean
Open fire if you seem to be blocking my dreams, yessir

(Paperwork)
Don't do no business until you check his (paperwork)
And if all else fails, I just hope that this (paperwork)
Wanna swing Bentley doors, blow smoke through the roof
Everything got a cost, they gone need something on you

Hey Hey Hey Hey
Damn shawty
Look at you
I’m just saying man
Is it just me or you got too much ass in them jeans
Come here

Hey
I been watchin’ you a while now
And i just wanna find a way to make you smile now
Why you blushing, forget about them other guys now
I know you aint trying to tell me that you shy now
I realize that youre beauty could intimidate
Them suckers you aint got no business for them anyway
With such a, pretty face big booty, little waistline..
I wanna grab from behind to the bass line.
Have a great time, pull yourself a shot girl
Chase it with the lime, now you feeling like a hot girl
I know you’re probably used to deal with them wannabe’s
But honestly I gotta say, im who they wanna be.
I promise all I wanna see is you up under me
Now we can disappear whenever, when you wanna leave
I could guarantee the ride of your life
Any fantasies on your mind, we can try them tonight

[Hook]
Oh yeah sitting here (im looking at you like that)
We sippin’ on patron, something’s on my mind (you wanna leave with me tonight)
It’s been killing me all night long, and I wonder(Misses shawty let me tell you what I’m thinking ‘bout)
Oh girl I wonder (for real shawty let me tell you what I’m thinking ‘bout)
It’s the end of the night, and I’m thinking you might
Wanna leave the bar, park the car, turn into a porn star

Yes, I’d love to hear about your interests
I gotta say, your intellect got me impressed
See youre panty’s, do your dress like a silhouette(look at that)
Patrone got me thinking sex, did you feelin’ that
All due respect though, a simple yes- no
Hey let yourself let go, shawty let’s go (let’s go)
Pull you to the crib, get you to the dress show
Kiss you from your pretty lips till you red toes
I’m thinking it’s the end of the night
Hey you could leave with your friend if you like
But I’m saying no (I’m saying no)
Hey we could ride out
Back to my house
I wanna see you satisfied inside out
Once I’m in you aint gon’ want me to slide out
You tell your girlfriends they gon’ wanna try out
A lil more let’s loosen you up
What we can’t do in the club we can do in the truck (lets go)

[Hook]
Oh yeah sitting here (im looking at you like that)
We sippin’ on patron, something’s on my mind (you wanna leave with me tonight)
It’s been killing me all night long, and I wonder (Misses shawty let me tell you what I’m thinking ‘bout)
Oh girl I wonder.. (for real shawty let me tell you what I’m thinking ‘bout)
It’s the end of the night, and I’m thinking you might
Wanna leave the bar, park the car, turn into a porn star

Hey would you..stay
Could you..play with it, with your tongue just a..little
You such a sexy individual physical and mental
And if it’s sentimental shouldn’t rules bend a little
Hey let me start at the top stop in the middle use a popsicle
Make you shiver giggle when it tickle
I could talk to you dirty if you’d like that (bad girl)
I finish once, hit a blunt, start right back
I know you told me you a good girl
But shawty you’s grown woman not a little girl
You could blame it on the patron or the champagne
But sometimes being bad could be a good thing

[Hook]
Oh yeah sitting here (im looking at you like that)
We sippin’ on patron, something’s on my mind (you wanna leave with me tonight)
It’s been killing me all night long, and I wonder(misses shawty let me tell you what I’m thinking ‘bout)
Oh girl I wonder (for real shawty let me tell you what im thinking ‘bout)
It’s the end of the night, and I’m thinking you might
Wanna leave the bar, park the car, turn into a porn star

Oh yeah sitting here
We sippin’ on patron, something’s on my mind
It’s been killing me all night long, and I wonder
Oh girl I wonder
It’s the end of the night, and I’m thinking you might

45 in my other hand.

Call me trouble man
Always in trouble man
Worth a couple hundred grand
Chevys, all colors man

[Verse 1:]
Rubber band man
Like a one man band
Treat these niggas like the Apollo
And i'm the sandman.
Tote a hundred grand
Canon in the waistband
Looking fo a sweet lick?
Well this is the wrong place man.
Seven time felon, what i care about a case man?
I'm campaigning to bury the hate,
So say ya grace man.
Ay, I don't talk behind a nigga back
I say it in his face.
I'm a thoroughbred nigga.
I don't fake and i don't hate.
Check my resume nigga.
My record's impeccable
Anywhere in the A nigga
How TIP is highly respectable.
And the MIA nigga
I'm tryna keep it professional
Cause all this tongue rastling.
Finna have me snappin, i'm tellin you.
From the bottom of tha Duval,

And everybody showin me love

Yeah, to all my Florida niggas, my Cakalacky niggas

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 2:]
Call me trouble man
Stayed in some trouble man

But still i love em man.

Stay down on his grind
Put the crown on the hustle
Ay, I could show ya how to juggle anything
And make it double.
Weed, blow, real estate, liquor sto

Young cats is playin today
Marvin Gaye of my time.

Livin how i say in my rhymes.
My cousin used to tell me
Take this shit a day at a time.
And told me Friday, died Sunday
We a day in the ground.
I still smile cuz somehow

And so i'm doing all my shows
Just like he in the crowd.
Ay, tho ya lightas up for my cousin Toot,
Aaliyah, Left Eye and Jam Master Jay.

[Chorus 2x]

[Verse 3:]
Grand Hustle man
Mo hustles than hustle man.
But why the rubber band?

Until they come up wit another plan
Stack and crumble bread
To get theyself off they mama land.
Gangstas who been servin
Since you was doing the runnin man.
Went down, did 10
Back round and rich again.
That's why i'm young
Wit the soul of a old man

Slow ya roll man.
Still ride around
With the glock on patrol man.

For ma niggas slangin blow, pimpin hos
Rollin vogues, 24s.
Let these other niggas know.

[Chorus 2x]---Lyrics submitted by Kathy.

[Verse One: T.I.]
When I think about all my time and all my struggle
Through all my grinding and all my troubles
Man I came up from nothing, all I had was a hustle
with a blindfold trying to find pieces to the puzzle no muzzle
I tell it like it is, that's that
Right or wrong I'ma call it like I see it don't forget
That impossible is nothing your environments irrelavant
just don't let your emotions overpower your intelligence
Refuse to give up, your mistakes don't define you
they don't dictate where your headed they remind you
The Time keep ticking let your mind keep clicking
Never stop thinking be aware of your positions
Be aware of the collisions and the potholes sitting
on the road that you travel on your life long mission
just listen every day is like a snapshot taken
if you live you can learn to be patient

[Hook: John Legend]
Cuz life is like a slideshow
all the places that I go
and I the things that I know
through all the highs and low
Cuz life is like a slideshow
All things that I've seen
and all the things that I've dreamed
you can't take away from me
cuz life is like a slideshow

[Verse Two: T.I.]
As I look back at a fly young cat
who could rap with a dream look where I took that
Beginning on Bankhead then it spread out
vision in my head all I had to was get it out
when I walked out of my house and looked at my street
All I seen was opportunity that led me to truency
I ain't really have a role model to infleunce me
Uncle Quinn in prison they say next it's going be you in it
As I juvenile caught cases so fluently
Look at my life and learn from it don't do it
if I only knew back then what I know now
how much better life would of been if I'da slowed down
Maybe I'da been Kanye instead of seeing Gunplay
But God got a plan, I'll understand one day
But one day of life, like a snapshot taken
Just believe you can make it have faith be patient

[Hook]

[Legend singing]
Ohhhh, ohhh, ohhhhhh~!
Looking back on my lifetime
see the slides go by, sometimes I wonder why
looking back on where I've been
I remember when
do you remember then---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.

{T.I.}
My cup runneth over with pinot grigio, hold up
You bogus in the lambo if you ain't lifting the door up
You bogus popping pills if you ain't picking the ho up
You bogus running out on your kids my nigga grow up
For God's sake, like a wedding cutting large cake
For large stakes let the hammer bang broad day
Aye, nevermind what the blogs say
This what my mind and my heart say
My philosophy profit off of my properties
Get it, flip it, we got to be rich, that broke shit is obsolete
Possibly off of my rocker, watch how you watching me
Sophisticated, psychotic, fly as a pilot
Officially silent, all you wish you could get I got it
Unlimited titanium nigga, what's in yo wallet?
Out of gladiator college, I made it summa cum laude
While you clowns couldn't have got a cap and gown if you bought it
I parlay with Saudis, buying crude oil and diamonds
Hustle January, July, fly to Dubai
A broke nigga telling me about how I'm dividing the pies
Like a blind nigga telling me it's an eye for an eye
Bullheaded and stubborn I be that way until I die
But find a nigga with more hustle then me I dare you to try
And according to the hand on my Audemar
It's my time to shine so fück y'all

{Hook}
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
The fact is you can't please everybody
You can't please everybody
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to

{T.I.}
I grew up in the gutter life a motherfücker
I get that why I don't trust a motherfücker
Seen a nigga snitch on they mom, shoot at they brother
Go to prison in love with a bítch and a nigga fück her
I seen real G's destroyed by real suckers
Innocent ladies raped and defenseless babies abducted
Such a horrible truth but you see it over and over
It's nothing, get numb to it and your heart grow colder
Pacify your pain with a chain and a Rover
Fück it, justify your action with stacking your dough up
You show up with a brick of cocaine and baking soda
Just enough for me to blow up, nigga hold up
Switch the flow up, cause these niggas be snitching so much
I promise all they missing's the badge, coffee and doughnut
Go to jail so what, never see my integrity perish
That ain't the Harris' way, study my pedigree
Promise I'm one of the only ones who keep it 100
Probably why I think they all out to get me, you can't convince me
Large money and fame will plant seeds of envy
To make my partners resent me enough to come and get me
Catch me slipping and hit me, just like they did 50
Cause I'm in the position that he think he should be given
Listen, dawg, the fact of the matter is
I'm on a narrow path and we all can't travel

{Hook}
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to
The fact is you can't please everybody
You can't please everybody
What should I be sorry for
Who should I be sorry to

What it ain't, What it is? Even if you gotta live
I learned that apartment is way more exciting than a big ass house on a hill
I used to be a way better writer and a rapper
When I used to want a black Karmann Ghia
Now a nigga speeding in a Porsche
Feeling like I'm going off a course, cut these fück niggas off
Nigga TIP in my life scream that till I'm horse
Duck these get the fück off me projectiles, bítch you ain't really got a choice
I'm living my life live yours www.eliterics.com
I don't even like rapping fast, but that's how the world come to me
Talk to me sideways nigga that's your ass
Slow it down, this that shit that'll make you call your momma
Say hey I'm sorry for begging for all them clothes you couldn't afford
And this the type of shit that'll make you call your rap partner
And say I'm sorry I'm awkward, my fault for fücking up the tours
I hated all the attention so I ran from it
Fück it if we did, but I hope we ain't lose no fans from it
I'm a grown-ass kid, you know ain't never cared about no damn money
Why do we try so hard to be stars, just to dodge comments
And this that shit that'll make you call your baby mama
When you gone on half a pill, don't know why but that I did
Then you take a flight back to the crib, y'all make love like college kids
And you say all the shit you gon' do better, we can try this shit again
Round the time the dope wear off, you feel stupid, she feel lost
That's that dope, I mean, I mean dopamine you think Cupid done worn off
Waiting in the hallway with her arms crossed
Her baby boy face full of applesauce
Maybe should have stayed but it ain't your fault
Too much pressure, I fell off, I'm sorry!
Was young and had to choose between you
And what the rest of the world might offer me, shit what would you do?
Well I'd probably do it differently if second the chance
Only if some cool ass older man would've let me know in advance
This, this quarry, that is dug so deep in a father's chest
When he feel that he's broken up his nest
And he figured shit he was just doing the best that he could
Which end up being the worst that he could
And all some pussy nigga on the internet can say is that verse ain't good
It's boring, boring? Really? Hahaha

When I'm disgusted with this world and I can hardly breathe
Told so many lies, don't know what to believe
I discussed it with this girl and this is what she said
She said lay down baby, baby rest your weary head up
I love these distractions but my mind don't wanna rest
But my body disagree so I laid up on her breasts, yes
Oh, you are so fücking fine
I woke up the next morning with new purpose on my mind
Oh, who pulls your ponytail, who knows your body well?

What should I be sorry for?
Who should I be sorry to?---

Mr. West is in the building
Swagger on a hundred thousand, trillion
Ayo, I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the pilgrims
Thanksgiving do we even gotta question?
Hermes pastel I pass the dressing
My attitude is tattooed
That means permanent so I guess I should address it, huh?
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on the track I asthma attack it
Why he's so mad for? Why he gotta have it?
Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master
Na-Na-Na
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine
Na-Na-Na-Na-Na
Tryin' ta get that Kobe number, one over Jordan

(Jay-Z)
(No one on the corner) Gotta bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner gotta pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans cause my knots so thick
You can learn how to dress just by jocking my fresh
Jockin' jockin' my fresh
Jockin' jockin' my fresh
Follow my steps, it's the road to success
Where the niggas know you thorough
And the girls say "Yes"
But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks I'm a grad
And that all blue Yankee is my graduation cap, it's...
Hoooooooova
Dippin' different Rovers, whippin' with the soda
Hoooooooova
Could you even have any doubt that the doubt is over

No one on the corner have swagger like us

No one on the corner has swagger like moi, Church
But I'm too clean for these boi
I require what I desire, I got stripes, A-di-das
Mami scream "Papi no mas!"
Run up in your shit just me no mace
Runnin' this shit like I got four thighs
No one has swagga' like these fo' guys
When it comes to styles I got several
Sharper than a swagger dagger all metal
And my jewels blue and yellow
Type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto
Write your name on the bullet make you feel special
Ha, what the fuck you boys talking about?
I know it's us cause we the only thing you talk about

(Chorus)
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us

(Yea....You think?)You go see Weezy for the wordplay
Jeezy for the birdplay
Kan-yeezy for diversity and me for controversy
All my verses picture perfect only spit to serve a purpose
You ain't living what you kickin' and you worthless
Looking from the surface it may seem that I got reason to be nervous
Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it
Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical
Last thing I'm worried 'bout is what another rapper do
Ain't nobody hot as me...
Even if they rap they ass off, blast off and have outstanding qualities
Sell alotta records I respect and salute that
But spitting real life on hot beats...
I'm the truth at, you kick it like me no exaggeration necessary
Living revolutionary, nothing less than legendary
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad
Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag

(Chorus)
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger like us
No one on the corner have swagger like us

No one on the corner have swagger like us

Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air

New Akoo outfit with a Gucci rag
Tied to my belt loop and my Louis bag
Full of stacks, rubberbands 'round big cash
Got a sick swag til' the haters get mad (come on)
We in the club, homes gettin our thug on
Bottles of Patron if you grown get your buzz on
We brought the broads out and brought the cars out
I'm like the moon I shine and bring the stars out

We ball hard, suck a dick, eat ya heart out
I'm too advanced super swag in my Louis pants
Fallin on my Louis shoes, shirt match my Louis rag

Alright, okay, I don't dance, no way

I say whoa, kimosabe, big ballin is my hobby

If big money ain't the topic homie I ain't even talkin'
Hated on by the workers but I'm cool with all the bosses
Catch me flossin' at the mall, talkin to a broad
She follow me in Gucci and I taught her how to ball
3 pair of shoes, 4 shirts, 6 rags
Chick said damn, that's more than my bag
Shawty I can show you how to spend this bread real fast
Then get a group of chicks to give you head real fast
Silk scarf hangin outta my jeans y'all
Homie I ain't thinkin I'm just doin' my thing

Alright, okay, I don't dance, no way

I took some time off and now I'm back y'all
You in the line at the club I'm in the back dawg
And when this song on, ballas peel stacks off
And make it rain on them broads, watch the stacks fall
And pull your rag out and wave it left, right
Let it sag with ya pants get ya swag just right
Ride Bankhead flare flyin' out the Benz
Once a fool with it, we gon' bring em out again

Now I don't really care what you call me 
just as long as you dont call me rude 
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me 
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote 
streets like cold Chicago 
aint nothing new I've seen it all before 
but still I ball like no tomorrow 
goodnight it's over with thats all she wrote 
all she wrote, all she wrote 

I said it's over with thats all she wrote 
all she wrote, all she wrote 
Goodnight its over with that's all she wrote 

[T.I Verse 1] 
Its stupid how I'm going on everybody knowing that 
I'm sewing up the game, destroying like they hate me for it 
Eventually see they cant beat than with me they join 
others sworn under oath, or banished left completely scorn 
you tell lies, get caught, n-gga kick rocks 
you never did blend in with the big shots 
on the fast track, aint no need for no pit stops 
I just laugh at, n-gga wishing it was this hot 
guess they mad at me huh, really pissed off 
better that than pissed on 
I'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones 
catch me in the end zone 
high stepping prime time 
thought you n-ggas been on 
aint no blocking my shine 
like my new air Yeezy's, you can see me in the night time 
I get rich off living life, you check to check reciting rhymes 
so call me what you want, wanna hate, have a nice time 
while I get stupid paper, hey my dough aint in its right mind 
(mind, mind) 

[Chorus] 
Now I don't really care what you call me 
just as long as you dont call me rude 
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me 
"Goodnight its over with" thats all she wrote 
streets like cold Chicago 
aint nothing new I've seen it all before 
but still I ball like no tomorrow 
goodnight it's over with thats all she wrote 

[Eminem -Verse 2] 
Your staring straight into a barrel of hate 
Terrible fate, 
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape 
Cupid shot his arrow and missed 
Wait Sarah you're late, your train left. 
Mascara and egg smeared on your face 
Nights over goodbye, hoe 
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut aint nothing to cry over 
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover 
Shoulda' known i was trouble soon as I rolled up, 
Any chick who's coming up after I blind fold her, 
To still come back to the crib, 
Must want me to mess with the mind hold up. 
She mistook me for some high roller. 
But i wont buy her a soda 
Unless it's rock n' rye cola. (Faygo's cheaper) 
Buy u a bag of fritos I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder. 
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya 
tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars 
you get your eyes swole up i'm on my straight grizzly 
so why would I buy you a gay ass teddy you're already bi-polar 

[Chorus 2 - Eminem] 
Now I don't really care what you call me 
you can even call me cold 
these bitches know as soon as they saw me 
its never me to get the privilege to know 'em 
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go 
still I ball like there's no tomorrow until its over and thats all she wrote 

[T.I - Verse 3] 
The credit roller, curtain closer, movie over with 
But don't get mad at me 
go blame the chick who wrote this shit 
ya life is sure a bitch 
but she know I'm rich 
that why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick 
here I go again, 
I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pouring in 
Peso, Euro, yeah, ah ha, I'm paid never gon be broke again 
see me posted in anything, wearing any chain 
never gon see me toting anything 
all you gon see is BANG! 
its so nice where I kick it, 
hate you never get to visit 
yeah I'm on another level 
but you n-ggas still can get it 
its all over 'fore you finish 
sorry bro this road we end it 
won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business 

[Eminem] 
Yeah I guess life is a bitcha aint it TIP 
and this one can say this shit 
shirt off my back, I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief 
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine 
let em get a good taste of it 
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now, 
but in case you didnt 
this is so bad, better stick your nose to your forehead and staple it 
life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it 
so I pace this shit a little bit quicker 
that clock come racing in double time in it 
but I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time 
it may take you pricks to catch on 
while you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong 
man I still say K-mart's like theres an apostrophe-S on it dog 
and they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong 
but if you gon tell me that the A&W aint the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg 

[T.I. Bridge] 
and on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane 
I'm as strong as they came 
they were gone 'fore they came 
now I don't wanna hang, I slap fire with them rap guys 
they just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty thats why 

[Eminem] 
Now I don't really care what you call me 
you can even call me cold 
[T.I] 
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me 
Goodnight it's over with, thats all she wrote 
[Eminem] 
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I'm gonna go 
[T.I] 
But still I ball like there's no tomorrow 
Good night is over with thats all she wrote 
all she wrote, all she wrote 
I said its over with 
thats all she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote 
"Goodnight it's over with" thats all she wrote---Lyrics submitted by anais.
