I Was Riding Shotgun With Hair Undone In The Front Seat Of His Car
He's Got A One Hand Feel On The Steering Wheel The Other On My Heart
I Look Around Turn The Raido Down, He Says Baby Is Something Wrong
I Say Nothing I Was Just Thinking How We Don't Have A Song, And He Says

Our Song Is The Slam Of Screan Doors
Sneaking Out Late Tapping On Your Window
When Were On The Phone And You Talk Real Slow 
Cause It's Late And Your Mama Don't know
Our Song Is The Way You Laugh, The First Date Man I Didn't Kiss Her When I Should Have
And When I Got Home Before I Said Amen Asking God If He Could Play It Again

I Was Walking Up The Front Porch Steps After Everything That Day
Had Gone All Wrong, Had Been Trampled On And Lost Or Throne Away
Got To The Hallway Well On My Way To My Loving Bed
I Almost Didn't Notice All The Roses And The Note That Said

Our Song Is The Slam Of Screen Doors
Sneaking Out Late Tapping On Your Window
When Were On The Phone And You Talk Real Slow
Cause It's Late And Your Mama Don't Know
Our Song Is The Way You Laugh, The First Date Man I Didn't Kiss Her When I Should Have
And When I Got Home Before I Said Amen Asking God If He Could Play It Again

Da Da Da Da


I've Heard Every Elbum Listend To The Raido
Waiting For Something To Come Along That Was As Good As Our Song

Cause Our Song Is The Slam Of Screen Doors
Sneaking Out Late Tapping On Your Window
When Were On The Phone And You Talk Real Slow
Cause It's Late And Your Mama Don't Know
Our SOng Is The Way You Laugh, The First Date Man I Didn't Kiss Him When I Should Have
And When I got Home Before I said Amen Asking God If He Could Play It Agai-ai-ai   ain Again Oh Yeah Oh Oh Yeah

I was Riding Shot Gun With My Hair Undone In The Front Seat Of His Car
I Grabbed A Pen ANd An Old Napkin And I Wrote Down Our Song---Lyrics submitted by Elly.

Drew looks at me, 
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing 
everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, 
that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me, 
I laugh cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see, 
anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, 
he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus:]

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, 
don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, 
can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, 
so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, 
give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes,
and know she's lucky cause

[Repeat Chorus]

So I drive home alone, 
as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe
Get some sleep tonight

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, 
don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, 
but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into..

Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see.---Lyrics submitted by carly.

It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, ah ah. ah ah.
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, ah ah. ah ah.

Yeeeah,
We're happy free confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time

Oh oh!
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
22
22

It seems like one of those nights,
This place is too crowded.
Too many cool kids. ah ah. ah ah.
(who's Taylor Swift anyway? ugh)
It seems like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping.

Yeeeah,
We're happy free confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time

Oh oh!
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
22
22
I don't know about you
22
22

It feels like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights,
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights,
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
22
22
22
22

It feels like one of those nights,
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights,
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights,
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you ---

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart?
Now, why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Maybe I should've seen the sign
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say, I still cant believe
That you would walk away, it don't make sense to me

But why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart?
Now, why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Its not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart?
Now why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break?
Why would you wanna break a?

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart?
Now why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?---

I don't know what I want
So don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road
I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down

Even though I'm not the only one who feels the way I do

I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Can you tell me what more do I need

And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah, but that's okay

I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission but I'm ready to fly

I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong
Oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm alone, on my own
And that's all I know
Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Oh, I'm just a girl
Oh, I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh, I'm just a girl---

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone
And that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay
But I'm not fine at all

'Cause there we are again, on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed
Your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team
You tell me about your past, thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone
And there's nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again, in the middle of the night
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all to well

And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well ---

People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you’ve changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

(Stay)
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Then why’d you have to go
And lock me out while I let you in?
(Stay)
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it’s just too late
Well, could have been easy

All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, calling me up
But I don’t know what to stay
I’ve been picking off the pieces
Off the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me, are gone forever
When you say goodbye

(Stay)
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Then why’d you have to go
And lock me out while I let you in?
(Stay)
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it’s just too late
Well, could have been easy

All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)

Let me remind you
This was what you wanted
You ended it
You were all I wanted
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this

(Stay)
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Then why’d you have to go
And lock me out while I let you in?
(Stay)
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it’s just too late
Well, could have been easy

All you had to do was (stay)
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Then why’d you have to go
And lock me out while I let you in?
(Stay)
Hey, now you say you want it back

Well, could have been easy

All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)
All you had to do was (stay)---

Verse 1:
I’m so glad you made time to see me
How’s life tell me how’s your family 
I haven’t seen them in a while
You’ve been good busier than ever
We small talk work and the weather your 
Guard is up and I know why 
Cause the last time you saw me is still burned in the
Back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them in the dark


Chorus:
So this is me swallowin my pride 
standin in front of you saying I’m sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time 
it turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you 
wishin I ‘d realized what I had when you were mine 
I go back to December turn around and make it alright 
I go back to December all the time

Verse 2:
These days I haven’t been sleeping 
stayin up playin back myself leavin 
When your birthday passed and I didn’t call
Then I think about summer all the beautiful times 
I watched you laughing from the passenger’s side 
And realized I loved you in the fall 
And then the cold came the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love 
And all I gave you was goodbye

Chorus:
So this is me swalloin my pride
standin in front of you sayin I’m sorry for that night
I go back to December all the time
turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missin you
wishin I’d realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

Bridge:
I miss your tan skin your sweet smile 
so good to me so right 
and how you held me in your arms that September night 
the first time you ever saw me cry 
maybe this is wishful thinking 
probably wildish dreamin 
but if we loved again
I swear I would love you right
Id go back in time and change it but I can’t 
so if the chain is on your door
I understand

Chorus:
But this is me swalloin my pride
standin in front of you sayin im sorry for that night
And I go back to December….
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missin you
wishin I’d realized what I had when you were mine
I’d go back to December turn around and make it alright
I’d go back to December turn around and change my own mind 
I go back to December all the time

'Cause baby, now we’ve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you’ve done
'Cause baby, now we’ve got bad blood, hey
Now we’ve got problems
And I don’t think we can solve ‘em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we’ve got bad blood, hey

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin?
What was shiny, now it’s all rusted
Did you have to hit me?
Where I’m weak, baby, I couldn’t breath
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound, like you’re laughing right at me
Oh, it so sad to think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we’ve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you’ve done
'Cause baby, now we’ve got bad blood, hey
Now we’ve got problems
And I don’t think we can solve ‘em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we’ve got bad blood, hey

Did you think we’d we be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knives
So don’t think it’s in the past
These kind of wounds, they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won’t
So if you come in my way, just don’t
Oh, it’s so sad to think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we’ve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you’ve done
'Cause baby, now we’ve got bad blood, hey
Now we’ve got problems
And I don’t think we can solve ‘em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we’ve got bad blood, hey

Band aids don’t fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band aids don’t fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs bad

Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turned the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause he never did
I've been spending the last 8 months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

He said he never met one girl
Who had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause he never did
I've been spending the last 8 months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas and I won't talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause he never did
I've been spending the last 8 months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again ---Lyrics submitted by M P.

I'm five years old
It's getting cold
I've got my big coat on

I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run

Past the pumpkin patch
And the tractor rides
Look now -- the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep
On the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends
Could be so mean

I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys

And we drive and drive
Until we've found a town
Far enough away

And we talk and window-shop
Until I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to
Now at school
I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out
He's better than I am

I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And you're talking to me

It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarfs
Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine

And I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day
With you today---Lyrics submitted by jackie.

Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did

Me for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone
And let's hear the applause
She took him faster and you could say sabotage

I never saw it coming
wouldn't I suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from..

She's not a saint
She's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa!
She's better known for the things that she does on a mattress, whoa!

Soon She's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't you many friends
She should keep in mind 
she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge!

She lives her life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her present frown is a little troubling, and
She thinks I'm psycho cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Or they didn't teach you that in prep school
So it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

She's not a saint
She's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa!
She's better known for the things that she does on a mattress, whoa!

Soon She's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't you many friends
She should keep in mind 
she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge!

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but I always got the last word..

She's not a saint
She's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa!
She's better known for the things that she does on a mattress, whoa!

Soon She's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't you many friends
She should keep in mind 
she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge!

And do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
Cause I don't you do, oh!
And do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do, I don't think you do

Let's hear the applause!
C'mon show me how much better you are
So you deserve some applause
Cause you're so much better!

She took him faster and you could say sabotage!---Lyrics submitted by KC de Casro.

You held my hand and led me through the door
I know I always asked you for more
Youd give me everything just to see me smile
too bad you were only here for a little while

you taught me the difference between right and wrong
when mom and dad would fight youd tell me to be strong
i swear you told me you wouldnt be long
but im still waiting to see ur face again
tell me when

my big sister is gone for now
please dont make me tell u how
theres no one to walk me back from school
no one to hold me and say boys suck girls rule
my big sister knew me right
she tucked me in every night
my big sister watch out for the car
my big sister i dont where u are

so tell me how do u expect me
to forgive u after u left me
i had to listen to the fights
with tears rolling down my eyes---Lyrics submitted by HoLlY.

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love’s a game, want to play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain’t it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let’s be friends
I’m dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it’s gonna be forever
Or it’s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it’s over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we’re young and we’re reckless
We’ll take this way too far
It’ll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
But I’ve got a blank space, baby
And I’ll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You’re the king, baby, I’m your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
“Oh my God, who is she?”
I get drunk on jealousy
But you’ll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it’s gonna be forever
Or it’s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it’s over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we’re young and we’re reckless
We’ll take this way too far
It’ll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
But I’ve got a blank space, baby
And I’ll write your name

Boys only want love, if it’s torture
Don’t say I didn’t say, I didn’t warn ya
Boys only want love, if it’s torture
Don’t say I didn’t say, I didn’t warn ya

So it’s gonna be forever
Or it’s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it’s over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we’re young and we’re reckless
We’ll take this way too far
It’ll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
But I’ve got a blank space, baby
And I’ll write your name---Lyrics submitted by Elizabeth Rudnick.

I see your face in my mind as I drive away,
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way.
People are people, and sometimes we change our minds.
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time.

Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see.
Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,
Now I don't know what to be without you around.

And we know it's never simple, never easy.
Never a clean break, no one here to save me.
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt.
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve.
People are people, and sometimes it doesn't work out,
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out.

And we know it's never simple, never easy.
Never a clean break, no one here to save me.
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,

And I can't breathe without you
But I have to.
Breathe without you
But I have to.

It's two A.M.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me.
It's two A.M.
Feelin' like I just lost a friend.
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me.

And it’s a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it’s all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you’re getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I’ll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we’ll sing hallelujah, we’ll sing hallelujah

So we’ve been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It’s hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We’re getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But we’re faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don’t need this
But there’s something in your eyes
Says we can beat this

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we’ll sing hallelujah, well sing hallelujah

Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we’ve worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it’s the fight of our lives
But we’ll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It’s a revolution, throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And we sang hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah---

What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing.
Would the song still survive without 5 golden rings.
Would you still want a kiss without a mistletoe.
What would happen if god never let it snow.
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie
Tell me what would you find

(chorus)

You see that today called something special something holy not superficial. so here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives. Something that we all tried to ignore and put a wreath upon your door. Here's something you should know that is for sure. Christmas must be something more.

What if angels did not pay attention to all the things that we wish they would always do.
What if happiness came in a cardboard box then i think that's something that we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away.
Tell me what you would find

(chorus)

We get so caught up in all of it.
Business and relationships
hundred mile hour rides
and its the time of the year and everybody's here its the last thing on your mind

Is that the day called something special something holy not superficial.
So here's the day that Christ has saved our lives.
its something that we all tried to ignore and put a wreath upon your door
and here's something you should know that is for sure.
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more
there's got to be more
got to be more---Lyrics submitted by Angel.

Please take down the mistletoe
Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
Mama's in the kitchen worrying about me
Seasons greetings hope you're well
I'm doin alright if you were wondering 
Lately I can never tell

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
Everybody's here except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

But for me it's just a lonely time
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

Merry Christmas everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year

Bet you got your mom another sweater
Were you cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?

I know this should'nt be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't
Wonder how you are tonight
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.

The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we’d grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth
You still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can’t wear anymore
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That’s when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
And I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust
They covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs
I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That’s when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

I think I am finally clean
Said I think I am finally clean

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you clean, don’t mean you don’t miss it
Ten months older, I won’t give in
Now that I’m clean, I’m never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we’d grown together died of thirst

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That’s when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning
That’s when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Finally clean
I think I am finally clean
I, I
Think I am finally clean---

Eh Eh, T-Swizzle,T-Pizzle
I'm like 8 foot 4, blonde hair to the floor, your shawty's never thought I dreamed about rappin' hardcore

still live with my parents, but I'm still a thug
I'm so gangsta you can find me bakin' cookies at night, you out clubbin'
well I just make Caramel delights
T-Swift and T-Pain, rappin' on the same track, it's a thug story, tell me can you handle that?!
I had a dream last night, I had hightop nikes I had diamonds in my mouth and diamonds on my mic,
by the time I woke I was singin' I'm on the boooooat, cuz I'm a singa turned rappa
(shawty I'm a make it) Straight to the top yo  (shawty Imma take ya) 
They, call me T-swizzie now I'm a rap star, (It's a thug story now tell em who you are)
Singa turned gansta, you dont wanna fight me, (straight to the top ) in my extra small white tee, 
T-Swift and T-Pain rappin on the same track, it's a thug story, now can you handle that?
WHAT?! WHAT?!         I KNIT SWEATERS YO, WHAT WHAT, DON'T EST ME (bleep)
Hold on hold on, I didn't even say anything, (what) I said yo ( yo)  you guys bleeped me and I didn't even swear ( she didn't even swear) Hello?! 
Uh!!!!!---Lyrics submitted by Cassie.

You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight because I need to feel something.
You do what you want because I'm not what you wanted

Oh what a shame.
What a raining ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away no used to fulling words that you will never say.
Now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I never been anywhere cold as you.

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of grey
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with a nerve to adore you

Oh what a shame.
What a raining ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away no use to fulling words that you will never say.
Now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I never been anywhere cold as you.

You never did give a damn baby honey
But I cry cry for you
And I know you wouldn't tell nobody 
If I die die for you.

Oh what a shame.
What a raining ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you make is so condescending 
counting all the scars you made. 

Now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I never been anywhere cold as you.---Lyrics submitted by Amy Venusio.

You said it in a simple way,
4 AM, the second day,
How strange that I don't know you at all.
Stumbled through the long goodbye,
One last kiss, then catch your flight,
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself don't get attached,
But in my mind I play it back,
Spinning faster than the plane that took you...

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

The delicate beginning rush,
The feeling you can know so much,
Without knowing anything at all.
And now that I can put this down,
If I had known what I'd known now,
I never would have played so nonchalance.

Taxi cabs and busy streets,
That never bring you back to me,
I can't help but wish you took me with you...

And this is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in London today,
I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

This is falling in love in the cruelest way,
This is falling for you and you are worlds away.

New York... be here.
But you're in London and I break down,
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around.

This is when the feeling sinks in,
I don't wanna miss you like this,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.
I guess you're in New York today,
And I don't wanna need you this way,
Come back... be here, come back... be here.

I don't wanna miss you like this.
Come back... be here.
Come back... be here. ---

I'd never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go 
'Til you open the door
There's so much more
I've never seen it before
I was trying to fly
But I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

[Chorus:]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I
I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe

[Chorus:]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I 
I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

Baby you showed me what living is for
I don't wanna hide anymore
Oh oh

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier, crazier, crazier---Lyrics submitted by Zanelle Lorin Uy.

He said I got me a nice new apartment
In the city
Wouldn't you have hated that?
I'm getting by with the broken heart you left me with
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here today
and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

He was lying when he said he moved to LA
He's just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands
and she's just 7 miles away
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here today
and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

She almost called him on the night that he wrote
these simple words on his goodbye note

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here today
and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee---Lyrics submitted by rosa betenbaugh.

Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won’t fall through, again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin’ which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin’ up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home, I should've known.

Well maybe it’s me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it’s you and your sick need
To give love then take it away

And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back in regret how I ignored when they said,
"Run as fast as you can."

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
Don’t you think nineteen’s too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games?
When I loved you so, I should've known.

You are an expert at "Sorry"
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
Cause you've burned them out

But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don’t look now
I’m shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young
To be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song, you should’ve known.

You should’ve known
Don’t you think I was too young?
You should’ve known.---

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired lonely place

Walls of insincerity,
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey,
It was enchanting to meet you,
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you."

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you ---

(duet with Ed Sheeran) 

All I knew is the morning when I woke 
Is I know something now, something now I didn't before 
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago 
Is green eyes and freckles in your smile 
In the back of my mind making me feel right 

I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now 
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now 
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now 
I just wanna know you know you know you 

'Cause all I know is we said "Hello" 
And your eyes look like coming home 
All I know it's simple ain't it? Everything has changed 
All I know is you held the door 
You'll be mine and I'll be yours 
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed 

And all my walls stand tall painted blue 
And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you 
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies 
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time, 
Taking flight, making me feel right 

I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now 
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now 
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now 
I just wanna know you know you know you 

'Cause all I know is we said "Hello" 
And your eyes look like coming home 
All I know it's simple ain't it? Everything has changed 
All I know is you held the door 
You'll be mine and I'll be yours 
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed 

Come back and tell me why 
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time, oh, oh, oh 
And meet me there tonight 
And let me know that it's not all in my mind 

I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now 
I just wanna know you know you know you 

'Cause all I know is we said "Hello" 
And your eyes look like coming home 
All I know it's simple ain't it? Everything has changed 
All I know is you held the door 
You'll be mine and I'll be yours 
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed 

All I know is we said "Hello" 
So dust off the highest hopes 
All I know is pouring rain and everything has changed 
All I know is the new found grace 
All my days I know your face 
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed ---

All I knew is the morning when I woke 
Is I know something now, something now I didn't before 
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago

In the back of my mind making me feel right 

I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now 
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now

I just wanna know you know you know you

All I know is the new found grace 
All my days I know your face 
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed ---

Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around, oh they've surrounded you
It's a showdown, and nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open 
Keep your eyes open---Lyrics submitted by Lily Willams.

There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
Theres a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So baby drive slow
Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passengers seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it remember it

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake
I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in & Im a little more brave
Its the first kiss it's flawless really something its
fearless.

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress
Fearless---Lyrics submitted by talyah tignor.

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before."

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to red-headed Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your mamma's waiting up
And you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round the room when the night ends, when the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss makes your head spin around
But in your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

La la la la la la la

Your very first day
You take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors.---Lyrics submitted by Gabriella.

Once upon a time,
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night,
You looked me in the eye
And told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened, please tell me?
'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're half way out the door

And I stare at the phone,
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure

So here's to everything
Coming down to nothing
Here's to silence
That cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone,
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low, you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it, baby,
I don't think so

Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Oh, I stare at the phone,
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always

And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

You didn't mean it, baby,
You said forever and always... yeah ---

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me

I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
cause I'm still trying to figure it out 
don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
trying to see through the rain coming down
even though im not the only one
who feels the way I do...

CHORUS
I'm alone, On my own, and that's all i know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in 
this world

got the radio on, my old blue jeans
and I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
feeling lucky today, got the sunshine 
could you tell me what more do I need
and tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
but that's ok

REPEAT CHORUS

maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
but I'm ready to fly...

REPEAT CHORUS---Lyrics submitted by kayla.

Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Ah, ah
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home 
And everybody knows that

I don't even know her
But I feel responsibility to do what's upstanding and right
It's kind of like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer and crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition if I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception,
This I have previously learned

So don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Ah, ah
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home 
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

And I see you turn off your phone, 
And now you've got me alone
And I say, 
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

I just wanna make sure you understand perfectly 
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up, you chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition if I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it, if I hadn't once been just like her

Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Ah, ah
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home 
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

And I see you turn off your phone, 
And now you've got me alone
And I say, 
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number,
Let's consider this a lesson learned

Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Ah, ah
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home 
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

When I see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home 
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Don't look at me, you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

It would be a fine proposition if I hadn't once been just like her.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
but I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't lose you again
something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He would try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, I'm holding my breath
Won't see you again
something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I know, I know, I just know
You're not gone. You can't be gone. No.

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break.
Never thought I'd see it...---

Hey Stephen
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked
We were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen
Boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Hey Stephen
I've been holding back this feeling
So I've got some things to say to you, ha
I seen it all
So I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do

The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen
Why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights
You're perfect for me, why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near to shine, shine, shine

Hey Stephen
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls
Well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Myself
Can't help myself
I can't help myself---

I was reminiscing just the other day,
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away.
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time.
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.
Took off faster than a green light, go,
Hey, skip the conversation and you already know.
I left a note on the door with a joke we’d made,
And that was the first day.

And darling, it was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress,
We had this big wide city all to ourselves.
We blocked the noise with the sound of ‘I need you’,
And for the first time I had something to lose,
Well I guess we fell apart in the usual way.
And the story’s got dust on every page,
Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now.
And I see your face in every crowd.

Cause darling, it was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through.
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you.
Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in the next room.
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you,

It was good never looking down.
And right there where we stood was holy ground.

Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through.
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you.
Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in the next room.
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you.---

Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
She’ll open up the door
And say, “are you insane, ane?”
See it’s been a long six months
And you were too afraid
To tell her what you want, want

And that’s how it works
That’s how you get the girl
And then you say

I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I’ll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever

And that’s how it works
It’s how you get the girl, girl
And that’s how it works
It’s how you get the girl, girl

Remind her how it used to be, be
With pictures in frames
Of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind
When you left her all alone
And never told her why, why

And that’s how it works
That’s how you lost the girl
And now you say

I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I’ll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever

And that’s how it works
It’s how you get the girl, girl
And that’s how it works
It’s how you get the girl, girl

And you know
That I don’t want you to go
Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me
And then you say

I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I’ll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever

And that’s how it works
It’s how you get the girl, girl
And that’s how it works
It’s how you get the girl, girl

And that’s how it works
It’s how you get the girl, girl
And that’s how it works
It’s how you get the girl, girl

That’s how it works
It’s how you got the girl---

I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Cuz each time you reach out there's no reply
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say hello to you
And risk another goodbye

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

Oh we made quite a mess babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess babe
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me ---

Wish I had concentrated, 
They said love was complicated, 
But it's something I just fell into, 

And it was over-rated
just look what I've created
I came out alive but I'm black and blue-ue

Before you ask me if I'm alright, 
Think about what I, 
Had to do-oo, yeah

Wake up and smell the break-up
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan, 
And I'll bet, you thought you'd beat me, 
Wish you could only see, 
I've got an I heart question mark, 
Written on the back of my hand.

I'd be fine if you just walked by, 
But you had to talk about why, 
You were wrong and I was right, 

But I can't believe you made me, 
Sit at home, cry like a baby, 
Wait right by the phone every night, 

And now you ask about you and I, 
There's no you and I, 
Remember what you put me through, 
I had to, 

Wake up and smell the break-up, 
Fix my heart put on my make-up, 
Another mess I didn't plan, 
And I'll bet, you thought you'd beat me
I wish you'd could only see
I got an I heart question mark, 
Written on the back of my hand 

And when you're home alone at night, 
You'll still wonder 
Why you took everything I had, oh baby
and now youthink about you and I, 
There's no you and I, 
And I know, 
Someday you will... 

Wake up and smell the break-up, 
Realize that we won't make-up
It didn't go the way you planned, 
And you'll know you didn't beat me, 
When you look down and see, 
I've got an I heart question mark 
Written on the back of my hand, 
Written on the back of my hand
An I heart question mark, yeah
Written on the back of my hand---Lyrics submitted by v.

Another mess I didn't plan, 
And I'll bet, you thought you'd beat me, 
Wish you could only see, 
I've got an I heart question mark, 
Written on the back of my hand.

I'd be fine if you just walked by, 
But you had to talk about why, 
You were wrong and I was right, 

But I can't believe you made me, 
Sit at home, cry like a baby, 
Wait right by the phone every night, 

And now you ask about you and I, 
There's no you and I, 
Remember what you put me through, 
I had to, 

Wake up and smell the break-up, 
Fix my heart put on my make-up, 
Another mess I didn't plan, 
And I'll bet, you thought you'd beat me
I wish you'd could only see
I got an I heart question mark, 
Written on the back of my hand 

And when you're home alone at night, 
You'll still wonder 
Why you took everything I had, oh baby
and now youthink about you and I, 
There's no you and I, 
And I know, 
Someday you will... 

Wake up and smell the break-up, 
Realize that we won't make-up
It didn't go the way you planned, 
And you'll know you didn't beat me, 
When you look down and see, 
I've got an I heart question mark 
Written on the back of my hand, 
Written on the back of my hand
An I heart question mark, yeah
Written on the back of my hand---Lyrics submitted by v.

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down

Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning

And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble trouble trouble

And the saddest fear comes creepin' in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down

Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

Trouble, trouble, trouble---

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It’s a scene and we’re out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It’s a bad sign, bad sign

Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling in dark clouds
Love’s a fragile little flame
It could burn out, it could burn out

'Cause they got the cages
They got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters
We are the foxes and we run

Baby, I know places we won’t be found
And they’ll be chasing their tails
Trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Lights flash, and we’ll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won’t hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Just grab my hand
And don’t ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters
We are the foxes, and we run

Baby, I know places we won’t be found
And they’ll be chasing their tails
Trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They are the hunters
We are the foxes, and we run
Just grab my hand
And don’t ever drop it my love

Baby, I know places we won’t be found
And they’ll be chasing their tails
Trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, we’re bulletproof
(I know places)
And you know for me, it’s always you
(I know places)
In the dead of night, you act so brave
(I know places)
And I know for you, it’s always me
(I know places)---

It’s 2am, in your car
Windows down, past my street the memories start
You say it’s in the past
You drive straight ahead
You thinking that I hate you now
Cause you still don’t know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
It’s all good, I wish you would

It’s 2am, in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We were crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
It’d makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
It’s all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad any more
I wish you were right here, right now
It’s all good, I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad, love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would

2am, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We’re a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
It’s all good, I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
It’s all good, I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad any more
I wish you were right here, right now
It’s all good, I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad, love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would---

I don't think that passenger's seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
I count the colors in his eyes

He'd never fall in love, he swears 
As he runs his fingers through his hair
I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

Chorus:

And I can tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful
He got his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him
I'd lie

He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on
Doesn't he know that I had him memorized for so long

He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine

Repeat Chorus
Bridge:
He stands there and walks away
My God, if I could only say
I'm holding every breath for you

And he'd never tell you
But he can play guitar
I think he can see through
Everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up
Is my God, He's beautiful
So I put on my make-up
And pray for a miracle

Yes, I could tell you
His favorite color's green
He loves to argue
Oh, and it kills me
His sister's beautiful
He has his father's eyes
And if you ask me if I love him
And if you ask me if I love him
I'd lie---Lyrics submitted by Cassie  Kraemer.

Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
Sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side

And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small-town boy and girl
Living in the crazy world
Trying to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do

And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
And only you can tell

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you---

Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not here
I was playing back a thousand memories baby
Thinkin bout everything we've been through
Maybe i've been going back too much lately
Time stood still and I had you

Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now....
Like you could you could if you just said you're sorry

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
Cos nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall
Chasing down the street
Flashback to a night when you said to me
Nothings gonna change not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose...

Come back come back come back....---Lyrics submitted by SarahTaylor.

Guess you really did it this time
Left yoruself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tight rope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you

It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
Still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But tonight you live it all again
You would be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then
Wasn't it easier in your firefly catching days
When everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you

Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too

Minds change like the weather 
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to.. be brand new

It's all right, just wait and see 
Your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

You're still an innocent
Lost your balance on the tightrope
It's never too late to get back---Lyrics submitted by Robyn.

She can’t see the way your eyes 
Light up when you smile. 
She’ll never notice how you stop and stare 
Whenever she walks by. 

And you can’t see me wantin' you the way you want her 
But you are everything to me. 

I just wanna show you 
She don’t even know you, 
She's never gonna love you like I want to. 
And you just see right through me. 
If you only knew me 
We could be a beautiful 
Miracle, 
Unbelievable 
Instead of just invisible. 

There’s a fire inside of you 
That can’t help but shine through. 
She’s never gonna see the light 
No matter what you do. 

And all I think about is how to make you think of me 
And everything that we could be 

Like shadows in a faded light 
Oh, we’re invisible. 
I just wanna open your eyes 
And make you realize. 

I just wanna show you 
She don’t even know you. 
Baby, let me love you, 
Let me want you. 
You just see right through me 
But if you only knew me 
We could be a beautiful 
Miracle, 
Unbelievable 
Instead of just invisible. 

She can’t see the way your eyes 
Light up when you smile.---

I like the way you sound in the morning.
We’re on the phone and without a warning. 
I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard. 

I like the way I can’t keep my focus. 
I watch you talk you didn’t notice.
I hear the words but all I can think is.
We should be together.

Every time you smile, I smile, 
And every time you shine, I’ll shine for you. 
Whoa oh I’m feeling you baby. 
Don’t be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me.
Baby, never gonna leave you. 
Say that you wanna be with me too. 
So I’ma stay through it all. 
So jump then fall.

Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You’ve got the keys to me. 
I love each freckle on your face.
Oh I I‘ve never been so wrapped up.
Honey,  
I like the way you’re everything I ever wanted. 
I had time to think it all over. 
And all I can say is come closer.
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me. 

Cause every time you smile I smile. 
And every time you shine I’ll shine for you. 
Whoa oh I’m feeling you baby. 
Don’t be afraid to jump then fall, jump then fall into me. 
Baby, never gonna leave you say that you wanna be with me too. 
So I’ma stay through it all. 
So jump then fall.

The bottom’s gonna drop out from under our feet. 
I’ll catch you, I’ll catch you. 
And people say things that bring you to your knees. 
I’ll catch you. 
The time is gonna come when you’re so mad that you could cry. 
But I’ll hold you through the night until you smile.

And whoa oh I need you baby. 
And don’t be afraid please jump and fall, jump then fall into me. 
Baby, I’m never gonna leave you.
Say that you wanna be with me too. 
Cause I’m a stay through it all so jump and fall, jump then fall,

You can jump then fall jump then fall jump then fall into me, 
Into me yeah.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart,
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

Once bitten and twice shy,
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye.
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year. It doesn't surprise me.

Merry Christmas. I wrapped it up and sent it
with a note saying "I Love You"
I meant it.
Now I know what a fool I've been,
but if you kiss me now, 
I know you'll fool me again.

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart,
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart,
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

A crowded room and friends with tired eyes.
I'm hiding from you and your soul of eyes.
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on.
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on.

A face of a lover with a fire in his heart.
A girl on a cover, but you tore her apart.
May be this year, maybe this year,
I'll give it to someone special.

Cause last Christmas, I gave you my heart,
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart, 
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart,
But the very next day, you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.---Lyrics submitted by Paige.

I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last...---

Found myself at your door, 
Just like all those times before, 
I’m not sure how I got there, 
All roads they lead me here. 

I imagine you are home, 
In your room, all alone, 
And you open your eyes into mine, 
And everything feels better, 

Right before your eyes, 
I’m breaking, no past 
No reasons why, 
Just you and me. 

This is the last time I’m asking you this, 
Put my name at the top of your list, 
This is the last time I’m asking you why, 
You break my heart in the blink of an eye. 

You find yourself at my door, 
Just like all those times before, 
You wear your best apology, 
But I was there to watch you leave, 

And all the times I let you in, 
Just for you to go again, 
Disappear when you come back, 
Everything is better. 

When right before your eyes, 
I’m aching, run fast, 
Nowhere to hide, 
Just you and me… 

This is the last time I’m asking you this, 
Put my name at the top of your list, 
This is the last time I’m asking you why, 
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye… 

This is the last time you tell me I’ve got it wrong, 
This is the last time I say it’s been you all along, 
This is the last time I let you in my door, 
This is the last time, I won’t hurt you anymore. 

Oh, oh, oh, 

This is the last time I’m asking you this, 
Put my name at the top of your list, 
This is the last time I’m asking you why, 
You break my heart in the blink of an eye. 

This is the last time I’m asking you this, (this is the last time I’m asking you this) 
Put my name on the top of your list, (name on the top of your list) 
This is the last time I’m asking you why, (this is the last time I’m asking you why) 
You break my heart in the blink of an eye. (You break my heart…) 

This is the last time I’m asking you this, 
Time I’m asking you this, 
Time I’m asking you this, 
Time I’m asking you this.. ---

I said remember this moment, in the back of my mind 
The time we stood with our shaking hands 
The crowds and stands went wild 
We were the Kings and the Queens 
And they read off our names 
The night you danced like you knew our lives 
Would never be the same 
You held your head like a hero 
On a history book page 
It was the end of a decade 
But the start of an age 

Long live the walls we crashed through 
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you 
I was screaming long live all the magic we made 
And bring on all the pretenders 
One day we will be remembered 

I said remember this feeling 
I passed the pictures around 
Of all the years that we stood there 
On the side-lines wishing for right now 
We are the Kings and the Queen 
You trade your baseball cap for a crown 
When they gave us our trophies 
And we help them up for our town 
And the cynics were outraged 
Screaming this is absurd 
Cause for a moment a band of theives 
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world 

Long live the walls we crashed through 
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you 
I was screaming long live all the magic we made 
And bring on all the pretenders 
I'm not afraid 
Long live all the mountains we moved 
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you 
I was screaming long live the look on your face 
And bring on all the pretenders 
One day we will be remembered 

Hold on to spinning around 
Confetti falls to the ground 
May these memories break our fall 
Will you take a moment, promise me this 
That you'll stand by my forever 
But if god forbid fate should step in 
And force us into a goodbye 
If you have children some day 
When they point to the pictures 
Please tell them my name 
Tell them how the crowds went wild 
Tell them how our hope it shined 

Long live all the mountains we moved 
I had the time of my life with you 
Long, long live the walls we crashed through 
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you 
I was screaming long live all the magic we made 
And bring on all the pretenders 
I'm not afraid 
Long live all the mountains we moved 
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you 
I was screaming long live the look on your face 
And bring on all the pretenders 
One day we will be remembered---Lyrics submitted by millie.

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes
And the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights
See the party, the ball gowns
I see you make your way through the crowd
And say hello, little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go, and I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes

Romeo save me, they try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say yes
Oh oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you is fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

And said, marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say yes

Oh, oh, oh, oh

We were both young
When I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there...
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
I see you make your way through the crowd and say "Hello."
Little did I know...
That you were Romeo
You were throwing pebbles
And my Daddy said "STAY AWAY FROM JULIET!!!"
And I was crying on the staircase begging you "PLEASE DON'T GO!!!"

                                                    CHORUS

"Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone.
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run.
You'll be the prince
And I'll be the princess
It's a LOVE STORY!
Baby, just say "Yes!!" "

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cuz we're DEAD if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little whi-le...

UH OH!!

'Cuz you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter

They're trying to tell me how to feel 
This love is difficult
But it's re-al 
Don't be afraid 
We'll make it out of this mess
It's a LOVE STORY!!
Baby, just say "Yes!!"

New to town with a made up name in the angel city,
Chasing fortune and fame.
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream.
You had it figured out since you were in school.
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool.
So overnight you look like a sixties’ queen.

Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky.

And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one.

Now it’s big black cars, and Riviera views,
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page.

And they tell you that you’re lucky.
But you’re so confused,
Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used.
And all the young things line up to take your place.

Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if you’ll make it out alive.

And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

It was a few years later, I showed up here.
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,
And it took some time, but I understand it now.

‘Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right,

Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, whoa, oh, oh ---

There's a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever, never say never
You could do better, that's what she says

Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you

She sings her little song, she walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies
Left to travels, lives they unravel
Mind over matter, that's what she says

Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you, lucky you

Maybe she'll sing you do do do do
Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
Honey she'll love you, funny how some view
Angels above you ain't so far away

Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says lucky you, lucky you ---

she said i ws sseven and you wee nine
i looked at you like the stars that shined
in the sky the pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
growing up and falling in love and mamas smiled
and rolled their eyes and said oh my my my

take me back to the house in the backyard tree
said youd beat me up you were bigger than me
you never did you never did
take me back when our world was one block wide
i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried 
just two kids you and i...
oh my my my my

i was sixteen when suddenly
i wasnt that little girl you used to see
but your eyes still shined like pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
they never believed wed really fall in love
and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
and said oh my my my...

take me back to the creek beds we turned up
two a.m. riding in you truck and all i need is you next to me
take me back to the time we had our very first fight
the slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
you stayed outside till the morning light
oh my my my my

a few years had gone and come around
we were sitting at our favorite spote in town
and you looked at me got down on one knee

take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
our whole town came and our mamas cried
you said i do and i did too
take me home where we met so many years before 
well rock our babies on that very front porch
after all this time you and i

ill be eighty-seven youll be eighty-nine
ill still look at you like the stars that shine
in the sky oh my my my...---Lyrics submitted by kayla.

You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You picking on the weaker man

You can take me down with just one single blow
But you don't know, what you don't know...

Someday I'll be living in a big ol' city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down
Trying to block you out 'cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know, what you don't know...

Someday I'll be living in a big ol' city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean

All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday I'll be living in a big ol' city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so?..

Someday I'll be living in a big ol' city (Why you gotta be so?..)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean (Why you gotta be so?..)
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me (Why you gotta be so?..)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?---

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

You were in college, working part time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin’
Wonderin’ why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, can you believe it?
As we’re lyin’ on the couch
The moment I can see it,
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember we were sittin’ there by the water
You put your arm around me, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine

Flash forward and we’re taking on the world together
And there’s a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I’m guarded
You say we’ll never make my parents’ mistakes

But we’ve got bills to pay
We’ve got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sittin’ there by the water
You put your arm around me, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water
You saw me start to believe, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine

Oh, oh
And I remember that fight, 2:30am
As everything was slippin’ right out of our hands
I ran out cryin’ and you followed me out into the street

Brace myself for the goodbye, cause that’s all I’ve ever known
And you took me by surprise
You said I’ll never leave you alone
You said
I remember how we felt sittin’ by the water
And every time I look at you, it’s like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man’s careful daughter
She is best thing that’s ever been mine

Hold on, you’ll make it last
Hold on, never turn back

You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine

(Hold on) do you believe it?
(Hold on) We’re gonna make it now
(Hold on) I can see it
(Yeah, yeah) I can see it now---Lyrics submitted by Kate Maher.

You should've been there,
Should've burst through the door,
With that "baby I'm right here" smile,
And it would've felt like,
A million little shining stars had just aligned,
And I would've been so happy.

Christmas lights glisten,
I've got my eye on the door,
Just waiting for you to walk in,
But the time is ticking,
People ask me how I've been as I comb back through my memory,
How you said you'd be here,
You said you'd be here.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no-one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
As I'm looking around the room,
But there's one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

And the hours pass by,
Now I just wanna be alone,
But your close friends always seem to know when there's something really wrong,
So they follow me down the hall,
And there in the bathroom,
I try not to fall apart,
And the sinking feeling starts,
As I say hopelessly,
"He said he'd be here."

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no-one to impress,
And they're all laughing,
And asking me about you,
But there's one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

What do you say when tears are streaming down your face,
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do when the one who means the most to you,
is the one who didn't show?
You should've been here.
And I would've been so happy.

And it was like slow motion,
Standing there in my party dress,
In red lipstick,
With no-one to impress,
And they're all standing around me singing,
Happy Birthday to you,
But there's one thing missing,
And that was the moment I knew.

Ooh, I knew.

You call me later,
And say I'm sorry I didn't make it.
And I said I'm sorry too,
And that was the moment I knew.---Lyrics submitted by Ariana Olvera.

Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At 14 there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder that I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up---

We’re all bored, we’re all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren’t coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We’re so young, but we’re on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we’re doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey life is just a class room

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And everyday is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby we’re the new romantics
Come, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We’re too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby we’re the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We’re all here the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back it’s all in the timing
It’s poker, you can’t see it in my face
But I’m about to play my ace
We need love but all we want is danger
We team up and switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey most of them are true

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And everyday is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby we’re the new romantics
Come, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We’re too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby we’re the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded
It’s so romantic, it’s so romantic

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And everyday is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And everyday is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby we’re the new romantics
Come, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We’re too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby we’re the new romantics
The best people in life are free---

In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, 'This time I've had enough'
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up
Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I say "leave" but all i really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

and me and my stupid pride, we're sittin' here alone
going through the photographs
starin' at the phone
I keep going back over, things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread
So baby if you know everything 
Tell me why you couldn't see
That when I left I wanted you to chase after me

Yeah, I say leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, 'there's nothing you can say
To make this right again'
I mean it, I mean it, what I mean is

I say leave but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, 'I'm in love with you'
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carry me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you---Lyrics submitted by Mackenzie.

We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was falling
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I could have spent a life with you
But those days were over
You were calling my name when your face faded from view

And wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day
And wasn't it you who told me:

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
And stars collide and the air's alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?

I remember waking up with you
The days doing nothing
You meant more to me then than I think you ever knew.
But you were gonna be a doctor, movie star
A poet at a Nobel seminar
I hope the world never tore that out of you

Cause wasn't it you who told me the sun would always chase the day
Yeah wasn't it you who told me:

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
And stars collide and the air's alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?

And what ever happened to the things you loved
And the songs we played, and the indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like Harold and Maude and singing
Like Harold and Maude and singing

I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were writing backwards in a dusty window pane

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
And stars collide and the air's alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night?---Lyrics submitted by Rachel.

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing,
I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"
And he says...

[Chorus:]
Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up
The front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway,
Well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice
All the roses
And the note that said...

[Chorus:]
Our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, when I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song...

[Chorus:]
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door,
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, when I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

Oh, yeah...
Oh-oh, yeah.

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen
And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song ---Lyrics submitted by Angelica Besite.

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing,
I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"
And he says...

[Chorus:]

Elevator buttons and morning air
Stranger's silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, my choice is you

Chorus
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care cuz right now you're mine

Chorus
And you'll say, “So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours.”

And its not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough but they are where mine belong in
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
Cuz I love the gap between your teeth
I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored cuz my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours---Lyrics submitted by anna.

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking…

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?
Good

Are we out of the woods?

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance,
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did, too
But when the sun came up, I was looking' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said, "I'm setting' you free,"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
And when the sun came up, you were looking' at me
You were looking' at me
You were looking' at me,
I remember, oh, I remember---

I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, but never knew
I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside ---

State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
[Album version line:] That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay!

By the way...

I hate that stupid old pickup truck

Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burn!

There's no time for tears,
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

And if you're missing me,
You'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck

I don't know what I want, so don't ask me 
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out 
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking 
Trying to see through the rain coming down 
Even though I'm not the only one 
Who feels the way I do 

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know 
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on 
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world 

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans 
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve 
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine 
Could you tell me what more do I need 
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah 
But that's ok 

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know 
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on 
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world 

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission 
But I'm ready to fly 

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know 
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on 
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know 
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world 

Oh I'm just a girl 
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh, 
Oh I'm just a girl ---

Loving him is like,
driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind,
passionate as sin,
ending so suddenly
Loving him is like,
trying to change your mind
once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
so bright, just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I've never known,
Missing him was dark grey, all alone,
Forgetting him was like
trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

Touching him was like,
realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like, 
wishing you'd never found out that love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I've never known,
Missing him was dark grey, all alone,
Forgetting him was like
trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Oh red
Burning red

Remembering him comes
in flashbacks, in echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
when I still see it all in my head
Burning red
Loving him was red

Oh, losing him was blue like I've never known,
Missing him was dark grey, all alone,
Forgetting him was like
trying to know somebody you've never met
'Cause loving him was red

Yeah, yeah red
Burning red

And that's why he's spinning round in my head,
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street---Lyrics submitted by M P.

I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor
Plastic dinosaurs, I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand
Little man, from even that moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Chorus:
Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember the drive home when the blind hope
Turned to crying and screaming, "Why?"
Flowers piled up in the worst way
No one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room in this hospital gray
We'll just disappear
Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand me downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back---Lyrics submitted by hhhaley.

Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and lonely will wait

We had a beautiful magic love affair
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in long conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, and different cities
And time is ticking a sweet summer race in you
And you've got your demons and darling they all look like me

Cause we had a beautiful magic love affair
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Distance, timing, break down, fighting
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen
Hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love affair
What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful
What we had, a beautiful magic love affair
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
We had a beautiful magic love affair
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair ---

(feat. The Civil Wars)

I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window darling
Everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone
Gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
La La (La La)
La La (La La)
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh

Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light,

Santa baby
Slip a sable
Under the tree
For me
I've been
An awful good girl
Santa baby
So hurry down
The chimney tonight

Santa baby
A '54 convertible
Too, light blue
Well
I'll wait up for you
Dear, santa baby
So hurry down
The chimney tonight
Yeah

Think of all
The fun I've missed
Think of all the boys
I haven't kissed
Next year I could be
Just as good
If you check off
My Christmas list

Santa baby
I want a yacht
And really
That's not a lot
I've been an angel
All year
Santa baby
So hurry down
The chimney tonight

Santa, honey
There's one more thing
I really do need
The deed
To a platinum mine
Santa honey
So hurry down
The chimney tonight

Come and trim
My Christmas tree
With some decorations
Bought at Tiffany's
I really do
Believe in you
Let's see
If you believe in me

Santa baby
Forgot to mention
One little thing
A ring
And I don't mean
On the phone
Santa baby
So hurry down
The chimney tonight---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.

I stay out too late    
Got nothing in my brain    
That's what people say, mmm-mmm    
That's what people say, mmm-mmm    

I go on too many dates [chuckle]    
But I can't make them stay    
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm    
That's what people say, mmm-mmm    

But I keep cruising    
Can't stop, won't stop moving    
It's like I got this music    
In my mind    
Saying, "It's gonna be alright"    

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play    
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate    
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake    
I shake it off, I shake it off    
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake   
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake    
I shake it off, I shake it off    

I never miss a beat    
I'm lightning on my feet    
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm    
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm    

I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)    
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)    
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm    
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm    

Shake it off, I shake it off 
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off 
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off 
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off    

Hey, hey, hey    
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world  
You could've been getting down to this sick beat 

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend    
She's like "Oh, my god!" but I'm just gonna shake 
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair    
Won't you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake    

Yeah ohhh---Lyrics submitted by Armani chalres.

It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you  feels wrong
And you say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes...

[Chorus]

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've know that word, bout what you did with her
Would get back to me...
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said no, baby and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
baby you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same...
You say that the past is the past, give me one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes...

[Repeat Chorus]

I can't resist... before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it...
Was she worth this...

No... no no no...

[Repeat Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by courtney.

It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you  feels wrong
And you say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes...

[Chorus]

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've know that word, bout what you did with her
Would get back to me...
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said no, baby and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
baby you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same...
You say that the past is the past, give me one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes...

[Repeat Chorus]

I can't resist... before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it...
Was she worth this...

No... no no no...

Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing halleluia
Christ the savior is born
Christ our savior is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God
Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth

Halleluia!
Halleluia!
Halleluia!

Christ the savior is born---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.

The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something,
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be.
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would...

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild.
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right.
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.

Drop everything now,
Meet me in the pouring rain,
Kiss me on the sidewalk,
Take away the pain
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile.
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

And the sparks fly...
Oh, baby, smile...
And the sparks fly...---

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you though it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

(CHORUS)
Don't say yes run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said speak now

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride to be
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me, you wish it was me... don't you?

(CHORUS x2)

I hear the preacher say '"speak now or forever hold your peace"
There's a silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

(CHORUS)

And you'll say, "let's run away now"
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows, so glad you were around when they said Speak Now---Lyrics submitted by deric.

I said oh my, what marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up late one night at the window,
He was 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song he was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

I said oh my, what marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

He said "look at you, worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking away "
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like oh my, what marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

Ooh ooh he's talking in crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

I said oh my, what marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things? ---

I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is don’t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I love the Sade’s are wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mostly of broken hearts
But this love is raging and wild

And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same again

This is a state of grace
This is a worth while fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real

And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is a worth while fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right---Lyrics submitted by isabella lim.

Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
These pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home
Saying, "Does he know?"
Will you ever know?

You're beautiful
Every little piece love,
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone,
Ask anyone.
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your love will lead you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't,
Stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, hey, by the way...

You're beautiful
Every little piece love,
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone,
Ask anyone.
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your love will lead you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't,
Stay beautiful

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold,
At least you'll know...

You're beautiful
Every little piece love,
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone,
Ask anyone.
And when you find everything you looked for,
I hope your love lead you back to my front door.
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
La la la
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
Oh, but if it don't,
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful

I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night.
I threw my phone across the room at you.
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away,
but you stayed.

This morning I said we should talk about it.
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved.
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said "okay, let's talk."

And I said,
Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay.

Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers,
that took all of their problems out on me.
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'.
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to:

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay.

You took the time to memorize me:
my fears, my hopes, and dreams.
I just like hangin' out with you, all the time.
All those times that you didn't leave;
It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life.

Stay.
And I'll be loving you for quite some time.
No one else is going to love me, when I get mad, mad mad.
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

Stay, stay, stay.
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
But I think that it's best if we both stay. ---

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
The end of you
Oh, it’s been a while since I have even heard from you
I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch it go round and round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And then, we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style
You’ve got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl fate, and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

So it goes
He can’t keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, he’s taking off his coat
I say, “I’ve heard, that you’ve been out
And about with some other girl, some other girl”
He says, “what you’ve heard is true, but I
Can’t stop thinking about you and I”
I said, “I’ve been there too a few times”

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And then, we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style
You’ve got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl fate, and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home

Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style---

Tall dark and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
Its the same thing to me
Hes got his mothers eyes his fathers ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
And I know every word that you say, yay
You smile and say how are you
I say just fine
I always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you ... forever

I watched superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today
To save the world ill be around
I watched superman fly away
Come back ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Talk dark and beautiful
Hes complicated hes so irrational
But I hope someday you take me away and save the day, yeeeeahhh
Something in his deep browns eyes has me sayin Hes not all bad like his, reputation
I can't hear one single word they say, 
You really got places to be and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you I loved you from the very first day

To save the world ill be around

And I hope you dont save some other girl

Im far away but i'll never let you go
Im lovestruck and looking out the window
Dont forget dont forget where ill be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

Cuz I loved you from the very first day

I watched superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today to save the world
Ill be around forever and ever

This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right, babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Morning loneliness, comes around when I'm not
Dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face, I'd be
Counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground (oh, oh)
Only sound, only sound that you hear is “no”
You never saw it coming
Except when you started runnning
And now you come undone (I, I, I)

Seen you fall, seen you crawl on you knees (eh, eh)
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen you colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won’t remember,
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, “I knew it all along”
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

Just a shot, just a shot in the dark (oh, oh)
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you’re on to something
I, I, I say

What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Put me right, threw me right when you put them front
And in this perfect weather
It’s like we don’t remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, “I knew it all along”
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

[Bridge]
I’ll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I’ll be one of the many saying
You’ve made us proud, you’ve made us proud

I’ll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I’ll be one of the many saying
You’ve made us proud, you’ve made us proud, proud

And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I’ll be there time and again
‘Cause I you loved when

When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is “no”
Now in this perfect weather
It’s like we don’t remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, “I knew it all along”
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction---

Say you’re sorry that face of an angel comes out 
Just when you need it to 
As I pace back and forth all this time 
‘Cause I honestly believed in you 
Holding on, the days drag on 
Stupid girl I should have known, I should have known 

That I’m not a princess 
This ain’t a fairytale 
I’m not the one you’ll sweep off her feet 
Lead her up the stairwell 
This ain’t Hollywood, this is a small town 
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down 
Now its too late for you and your White Horse, 
To come around. 

Baby I was naive, got lost in your eyes 
I never really had a chance 
I had so many dreams about you and me 
Happy endings, now I know 

I’m not a princess 
This ain’t a fairytale 
I’m not the one you’ll sweep off her feet 
Lead her up the stairwell 
This ain’t Hollywood, this is a small town 
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down 
Now its too late for you and your White Horse, 
To come around. 

And there you are on your knees 
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me 
Just like I always wanted, but I’m so sorry 

Cause I’m not your princess 
This ain’t a fairytale 
I’m gonna find someone, some day 
Who might actually treat me well. 
This is a big world, that was a small town 
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now. 
And it’s too late for you and your White Horse 
Now its too late for you and your White Horse 
To catch me now. 

Oh whoa whoa whoa oh 
Try and catch me now .. Ohh 
It’s too late .. to catch me now.---Lyrics submitted by emily.

Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me, I laugh cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus:]

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause

[Repeat Chorus]

So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe
Get some sleep tonight

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into..

Drew loos at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
What I want and I need and
Everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh cause it's so damn funny
But I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breath
And there he goes so perfectly 
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She better hold him tight
Give him all her love

I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but i'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why..

You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why..

Why..do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why..do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why
Why, tell me why

I take a step back, let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know---

I'm five years old
It's getting cold
I've got my big coat on

I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run

Past the pumpkin patch
And the tractor rides
Look now -- the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep
On the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends
Could be so mean

I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys

And we drive and drive
Until we've found a town
Far enough away

And we talk and window-shop
Until I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to
Now at school
I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
With you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out
He's better than I am

I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And you're talking to me

It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarfs
Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine

And I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day
With you today ---

(feat. Gary Lightbody) 

Found myself at your door, 
Just like all those times before, 
I’m not sure how I got there, 
All roads they lead me here. 

I imagine you are home, 
In your room, all alone, 
And you open your eyes into mine, 
And everything feels better, 

Right before your eyes, 
I’m breaking, no past 
No reasons why, 
Just you and me. 

This is the last time I’m asking you this, 
Put my name at the top of your list, 
This is the last time I’m asking you why, 
You break my heart in the blink of an eye. 

You find yourself at my door, 
Just like all those times before, 
You wear your best apology, 
But I was there to watch you leave, 

And all the times I let you in, 
Just for you to go again, 
Disappear when you come back, 
Everything is better. 

When right before your eyes, 
I’m aching, run fast, 
Nowhere to hide, 
Just you and me… 

This is the last time I’m asking you this, 
Put my name at the top of your list, 
This is the last time I’m asking you why, 
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye… 

This is the last time you tell me I’ve got it wrong, 
This is the last time I say it’s been you all along, 
This is the last time I let you in my door, 
This is the last time, I won’t hurt you anymore. 

Oh, oh, oh, 

This is the last time I’m asking you this, 
Put my name at the top of your list, 
This is the last time I’m asking you why, 
You break my heart in the blink of an eye. 

This is the last time I’m asking you this, (this is the last time I’m asking you this) 
Put my name on the top of your list, (name on the top of your list) 
This is the last time I’m asking you why, (this is the last time I’m asking you why) 
You break my heart in the blink of an eye. (You break my heart…) 

This is the last time I’m asking you this, 
Time I’m asking you this, 
Time I’m asking you this, 
Time I’m asking you this.. ---

New to town with a made up name in the angel city,
Chasing fortune and fame.
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream.
You had it figured out since you were in school.
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool.
So overnight you look like a sixties’ queen.

Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky.

And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh...

Now it’s big black cars, and Riviera views,
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page.

And they tell you that you’re lucky.
But you’re so confused,
Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used.
And all the young things line up to take your place.

Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if you’ll make it out alive.

And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

It was a few years later, I showed up here.
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared,
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere,
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square,
And it took some time, but I understand it now.

‘Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right,

Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.

Yeah they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one.
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, whoa, oh, oh ---

In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying 
Trying make me stay
I said this time i've had enough
and you've called a hundred times but i'm not picking up
cause I'm so mad I might tell you that its over
but if you look a little closer

I said leave but all I really want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming I'm in love with you
wait there in the pouring rain 
come back for more
and don't you leave 'cause I know all I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupied pride
are sitting here alone
goin through the photographs 
staring at the phone
I keep going back over 
things we both said
and I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread
so baby if you know everything
tell me why you couldn't see
that when I left I wanted you to
chase after me yeah

I said leave but all I really want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming I'm in love with you
wait there in the pouring rain
come back for more
and don't you leave 'cause I know all i need is on the other side of the door

and I scream out the window I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say there's nothing you can say
to make this right again and I mean it, I mean it
what I mean is
I said leave but baby all I want is you 
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming I'm in love with you
wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
and dont you leave 'cause I now all I need is on the other side of the door

with your face and beautiful eyes
and the conversation with the little white lies
and the faded picture of a beautiful night
you carry me from you car up the stairs
and I broke down crying was she worth this mess
after everything in that little black dress
after everything i must confess
I need you---Lyrics submitted by Nathalie.

I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, but never knew
I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside ---

I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us,
How we met 
And the sparks flew instantly
The people would say "they're the lucky ones" 

I used to know my place was the spot next to you,
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication, Miscommunications lead to fall out,
So many things that I wish you knew 
So many walls up I can't break through

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know 
Is it killing you 
Like it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us 
how I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like I should have held me, 
Oh I'm scared to see the ending why are we pretending this is nothing 
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how 
Ive never heard silence quite this loud.

(Chorus)
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know 
Is it killing you 
Like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side

The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love then fight 

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know 
Is it killing you 
Like it's killing me yeah
And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now 
NOW NOW! 

And were not speaking,
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me?

YEAH!

I don't know what to say since the twist of fate, cause were going down.
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

The End---Lyrics submitted by Sharuna.

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating intoxicating
Complicated, got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.

Clear blue water
High tides came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grow darker, currents switch you out again
And you are just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

Oh, oh, oh

Tossing, turning
Struggle through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning, flickered in my mind for only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone
Been losing grip, sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

(This love, this love, this love, oh…)

Your kiss, my cheek, unwashed, you leave
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
When you’re young you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me

(This love, this love, this love, oh…)---

feat. T-Pain

Hey Hey, T-Swizzle {T-Swizzle}
And T-Pizzle {T-Pizzle}

[Taylor Swift:]
I'm like 8 foot 4
Blond hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No I ain't got a gun
No I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents but I'm still a thug
I'm so gangster you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing but I just made caramel delight
T-Swift and T-Pain rapping on the same track
It's a thug story, tell me can you handle that?

[T-Pain & Taylor:]
I had a dream last night

[Taylor Swift:]
I had high top Nikes
I had

[T-Pain & Taylor:]
Diamonds in my mouth
And Diamonds on my mic

[Taylor Swift:]
By the time I woke I was singing

[T-Pain:]
I'm on a boat, wwhhoo 

[Taylor Swift:]
Cause I'm a singer turned rapper

[T-Pain:]
Shorty I'm a make ya

[Taylor Swift:]
Straight to the top, yo

[T-Pain:]
Shorty I'm a take ya

[Taylor Swift:]
You can call me T-Sweezy
Now I'm a rap star

[T-Pain:]
Hey, It's a thug story
Now tell 'em who you are
Singer turned gangster

[Taylor Swift:]
You don't want to fight me

[T-Pain:]
Straight to the top

[Taylor Swift:]
In my extra small white tee

[T-Pain:]
T-Swift and T-Pain all up on the same track
It's a thug story now can you get with that?

[Taylor Swift (T-Pain):]
What, What, I knit sweaters, yo!
What, What, Don't test me (Beep)
Hey, Hold on, hold on
I didn't even say anything I- (What?)
I said Yo (yup)
You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't swear (She didn't even swear)
Hello? Ugh!---Lyrics submitted by Ronae.

Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty 
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you 
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty 
But that's not true, cause I know you... 

Hold on, baby, you're losing it 
The water's high, you're jumping into it 
And letting go... and no one knows 
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone 
That you might not be the golden one 
And you're tied together with a smile 
But you're coming undone 

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted 
Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change 
Hoping it will end up in his pocket 
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain 
Oh, cause it's not his price to pay 
Not his price to pay... 

Hold on, baby, you're losing it 
The water's high, you're jumping into it 
And letting go... and no one knows 
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone 
That you might not be the golden one 
And you're tied together with a smile 
But you're coming undone 

Hold on, baby, you're losing it 
The water's high, you're jumping into it 
And letting go... and no one knows 
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone 
That you might not be the golden one 
And you're tied together with a smile 
But you're coming undone 

You're tied together with a smile 
But you're coming undone... oh 
Goodbye, baby 
With a smile, baby, baby ---

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said: "That's a lie."
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh, think of me
Mmmm
