Hit it!
Aww yea!
Yea...
La di da di... la di da di,
La di, la di!

You know what, you peep this,
La di da di, we like to party.
We don't cause trouble, we dont bother nobody.
We're... just some men that's on the mic,
And when we rock upon the mic,
We rock the mic (right!).
For all a y'all, keepin' y'all in health.
Just to see ya smile and enjoy ya'self.
Cause it's cool when you cause a cozy conditionin',
That we create, so that's our mission, so listen,
To what we say because this type of shit happens everyday.
I... woke up around ten o'clock in the mornin',
Gave myself a (strech up), a mornin' yawn and...
Went to the bathroom to wash up,
Had some soap on my face and my hand upon the cup,
I said a (mirror mirror!) on the wall...
Who is the top choice of them all?
There was a rumble dumble,
Five minutes it lasted.... the mirror said,
(you are you concieted bastard!).
Yo that's true, that's why we never have no beef,
So then i washed off the soap and brushed the gold teeth.
Used "oil of olay" cause my skin gets pale.
Then i got the files, for my fingernails.
True to the style on my behalf
I put the bubbles in the tub so i could have a bubble bath.
Clean, dry, was my body and hair,
I threw on my brand new gucci underwear.
For all the girls i might take home,
I got the johnson's baby powder and the (polo colonge).
Fresh dressed like a millions bucks, threw on the valley shoes
And the fly green socks.
Stepped out the house, stopped short, oh no!
I went back in i forgot the...
Then i dilly (dally) ran through a (alley),
Bumped into my old girl (sally) from the (valley).
This was a girl playing hard to get
So i said "what's wrong?" cause she looked upset
She said uh, (it's all because of you)
Say what? (i'm feeling sad and blue)
She said what? (you went away)
And now, my life is filled with rainy days.
And i love you so, how much you'll never know.
Cause you took your love away from me.
Now what was i to do
She was crying over me and she was feeling blue
I said, "don't cry, (dry, your eye)
Here comes your mother with those two little guys"
Her mean mother steps and says to me ("hi!")
Hit sally in the face and decked her in the (eye!)
Punched her in the belly, and stepped on her (feet)
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone.
Something was wrong i said what was going on?
I tried to break it up i said, stop it, leave her
She said, "if i can't have you (she can't either")
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So i broke the hell out like i had the chicken pox
But uh, she gave chase, she caught up quick
She put a finger in the face of mc rick, and said
So we can go cruising in my oj, and what?
I'll give you all my love today.
What? ricky ricky ricky what?
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And i just love your jazzy ways
Yo mc rick my love is here to stay"
And on and on and on she kept on
The bitch been around before my mother's born
I said, "cheer up!" i gave her a kiss
I said, "you can't have me i'm too young for you miss"
She said, "no you're not," then she starts crying
I says, "i'm thirty-four", she says, ("stop lying!")
I said, "i am -- go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, i can't be your lover!"
To the tick tock and you don't stopf
To the tick tick ya don't... hit it!

[Chorus: x4]
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again

[Verse One]
Aye sport, here's a thought from the old school crew
A serious situation we all go threw
It deals wit your feelins, so here what I say
It's like a dyke, but nothing seems to go your way
Bust this, two people, they really like each other
He says their's no one else
And she claims they're is no other
The feelins are same, and you receive a notion
To reveal your inner thoughts deeply hit emotions

[Chorus: x4]

[Verse Two]
Precious times, hopin they won't end
Tell your mother bout your lover
Or so your best friend
Ya mighty proud while your holdin her hand
Boys, yo that's my woman, and girls, yeah that's my man
This pressure brings a sort of warmth to ya heart
And everything seems so great at the start
For she loves him, and he also loves her
And it's hard to turn back to who the person you were
But later on, problems start to occur
And the bond, which combines, y'all turn into a blur
For the feelins were the same, now here's the score
You love him to much, and they don't love him anymore
Or did you have to choose a number
Or because your not bein true
Or maybe they're just plain sick of seein you
Word, now it might seem strange
You better take his quick, and make the right change

[Chorus: x4]

[Verse Three]
See just when you swore, the boy was wrong and
Then they're gone, and part of ya heart's been stolen
Get back on your feet, wit a hop and a skip
But no, you rather go wit this dead relationship
Hangin around, and buyin him stuff
You seem him every darn day, you don't see him enough
You follow them around, and they claim ya hawkin
When conversation comes, you do all the talkin
Not to mention, attention, we all need a bit
Behind ya back they're sayin, yeah he's all on my tits
They're gettin sick of you, and quite annoyed
And if you had plans for the future, they're now destroyed
You saw what was happenin, and you still let it
And if you ever let him make love to ya girl, you can forget it
Sweetheart, you been caught, spread around town
Passin then ya thoughts
And break up time, and your recitine the words
Yo this is fromt the heart, and I know the part hearts
Get over it, from now don't take short slick
If it's not true love, you shouldn't deal wit it
Just think of your future, and what is to come
And pay attention to the words that's in this song, they go

[Chorus: x4]

Do you know, where ya goin to
Do like the things that life is showin you
And are you going to... ---Lyrics submitted by Marquita Chocolatechip Foreman.
