Uhh uhh uhh.
You ready B? Let's go get 'em..

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Look for me! Young, B
Cruisin down the westside (high, way)
Doing what we like to do (our, way)
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
all of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
I'm mashin the gas, she's grabbin the wheel, it's true to the heart
She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during "Sex and the City"
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
Cuz mami's a rider, and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B
Holla!

[Chorus]
[Jay] All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend.
[Bey] Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend. (me and my boyfriend)
[Jay] All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend.
[Bey] Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend. (me and my boyfriend)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin
with the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin
Now they 'bout nothin - if ever you mad about somethin
It won't be that; oh no it won't be that
I don't be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin at Hermes, Burking Bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
so don't let the necessary occur, yep!

[Chorus]

[Beyonce]
(Talk to 'em B)
If I was your girlfried
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (that somebody was me)
Yeah-hee (break it down for 'em B)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
and all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
and all of my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by Dana.

If you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one

I got the Rap Patrol ont the gat patrol
foes that wanna make sure my caskets closed
Rap critics say he's "Money,Cash,Hoes"
Im from the hood stupid what type of facts are those?

If grew up with holes in your zapper toes
you celebrate the minute you was havin dough
im like fuck critics, you can kiss my asshole
If you dont like my lyrics you can press fast forward

Got beef with radio if i dont play they show
They dont play my hits, well i dont give a shit so,
Rap mags tryna use my black ass
So advertisers can dive em' more cash for ads fuckers

I dont know what you take me as
Or understand he intelligence that Jay Z has
Im from rags to riches niggaz I aint dumb
I got 99 porblems but a bitch aint one, hit me

99 problems but a bitch ain one
If you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one

The year is 94 and in my trunk is raw
And in my rear view mirror is the muthafuckin law
I got two chioces yall pull over the car or
Bounce on the Devil, put thw pedal to the floor

I aint tryan see no highway chase with Jake
Plus i got a few dollars i can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road I heard
Son do you know why im stopping you for

Cuz im young and im black and my hats real low?
Do I look like a mind reader sir I dont know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more
Well you was doin fifty-five in a fifty-four

License and registration, step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know alot of you are
I aint steppin out of shit, all my papers legit
well do ou mind if I look around the car a lil' bit

Well the glove department is lockesd and so is the trunck and the back
And I know my right so you gon' need a warrent for that
Arent you as sharp as a tack
What are you? A lawyer or something or somebody important?

Naw I aint pass the bar but I know a lil bit
Enough that you wont illegaly search my shit
Well we'll see how smart are when the canine comes
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one hit me

99 problems but a bitch ain one
If you havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one hit me

Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong arm a hoe
This is not a hoe with a sense of having a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, Try and push me

I try and ignore em' talk to the Lord
Pray for em' but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldnt bust a grape in a fruit fight

The onlt thing thats gon' happen is ima get to clappin and
He and his boys gon' be yappin to the captain
There I go trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the rif raf again

Feinds on the floor, scratchin again
Papparazi with thay cameras snappin them
D.A tried to gice an nigga shaft again
Half a mil' fo rbail cuz Im African

All because a fool was harassing him
Tryna play ya boy hike he saccharin'
But aint nuthin sweet how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems but being a bitch aint one hit me

99 problems but a bitch aint one
If you havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one hit me

99 problems but a bitch aint one
If you havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one hit me

Having girl problems I feel bad for you son
99 problems but a bitch aint one hit me
You crazy for this one Rick

It's the Roc! Wooo!
My gear is right... (check)
My bucket is low... (check)
My Rocawear is fittin' incredible...

Fuck it...
I guess I got my swagger back
Mama that said I killed her man
Well I guess I got the dagger back
It's the Roc bastards we are BACK!
In the heezy
Jiggaman, B. Sieg to M-Easy (what up fam?)
Oskino and Sparks and Freeweezy (holla!)
Mickey, Mallory, Chris and Neef, hey!
All I need is the love of my crew
The whole industry can hate me I thugged my way through
And all...I...need is a chick to hold a jimmy like
Meth and Mary, like, Marvin and Tammi, unnnh...
Now understands we can't be stopped
From blowin' Swisher Sweets outta candy drops
Like we underground kings, ridin' dirty
A nigga been focused since I said hi to 30 (what up?)
Young niggas ya'll can't hurt me
Better watch and observe me
And learn how to earn better, I burn cheddar
I set fire to your empire
I blow smoke in your face, burn rubber off the rim tires
Yes I-ah...Jay I-ah...
Double G-A livewire nigga holla back

CHORUS
All I need...
Rocawear... (check)
Nike Airs... (check)
Mean bucket... (uh huh)
Armadale in the club couple o' duckets (yeah)
Couple chicks by my side, let's ride
All I need...
That new coupe (got that)
A doo-rag and a pocket full o' loot (got those)
A sunny day some chicks that wanna play
And I'll be on my way

C'mon...now...
All I need in this world o' sin
Is me and my girlfriend! (ha ha)
I got a little two-two I call 'er Peggy Sue
When I'm off in the club she fit right in my shoe (wooo!)
Gotta switch her to my waist, just in case (uh huh)
A clown wan' flip gotta reach for my bitch
Wanna act out a movie I could give you a clip (buk!)
But no adlibbin' nigga stick to the script
Now all...I...need is a high-priced lawyer
Cuz it's five ways nowadays, everybody saw you
And they comin' to court too, I thought you knew
Can't even steal on a nigga muhfuckas'll sue
In this time and age, cuz real muhfuckas'll do
When I'm surrounded by squeal muhfuckas like you
But real niggas don't fret cuz the number one crew?
R to the O to the C comin' true

CHORUS

Listen...
The cream too long, my team too strong
Bleek is too hot, Beans is gone
Ya'll niggas in the crosshair, the beams is on (see ya'll)
Ya'll whole block deserted, ya'll fiends are gone (bye bye!)
The whole Roc is jumpin', we reached our zenith
Got fiends throwin' up on themself like Willy Beaman (*giggle*)
Any given Sunday gunplay's optional
However niggas want it like Soul II Soul (however do you waaaaant it)
Whoever got hops get blocked go to the hole
Dikembe Mutumbo of this rap shit
Plus the jab is sick, and it's that quick
Left hand'll lean 'em like a little past six
Now run along wit'cha little ass hits
Read my rap sheet nigga, THREE CLASSICS
Shut ya bumba' got A-Rod numbers
All you muddaskunks get buried in the trunk
When I blast the pump, I leave you relaxed
In the hospital lookin' at M*A*S*H for months
Then I dumps dough on the D.A. desk
And the fleece got free and pee-pee on the steps...
We've got no respect
No law or governin' why you fuckin' wit' him?
Matta'fact, why you fuckin' wit' them?
All ya'll need is the R-O-C baby

CHORUS

Listen...
(All I need)
Rocafella Records...
Freeway...
Oskino and Sparks...
Chris & Neef
(All I need)
Mickey and Mallory...
Broad Street Bully...
M-Extra Money, ha...
YOUNG!
(All I need)
H to the izzo...
CLUE!
Rell...
Uh huh...yeah, yeah...
(All I need)---Lyrics submitted by john.

Dreamed of you this morning
Then came the dawn, and I thought you were here with me
If you could only see
How much i love you
That's all that's all that's all baby
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
But there's always....
That's all that's all...

This is the shit you dream about with the homie steamin' out
Back-back-backing them Beemer's out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out
We need it now, we need a town
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound
For now, I'm just a lazy boy
Big dreaming in my La-Z-Boy
In the clouds of smoke, been playin' this Marvin
Mama forgive me, should be thinkin' bout Harvard
But that's too far away, niggas are starving
Ain't nothin' wrong with aim, just gotta change the target
I got dreams of baggin' snidd-ow the size of pillows
I see pies everytime my eyes clidd-ose
I see rides, sixes, i gotta get those
Life's a bitch, I hope not to make her a widow

[Chorus:]
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
Its just American dreamin'
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
Its just American dreamin'
Oh no, I'll never give up on you
I never felt that before
American dreamin'
But there's always....
That's all that's all...

Now see, the life's right there
And it seems right there
Its not quite near,
And its not like we're professionals movin' the decimals
Know where to cop? Nah! got a connect? No!
Who under Heaven know how to be successful
Need a Personal Jesus, I'm in Depeche Mode
They say its celestial, its all in the stars
It's like Tony LaRussa
On how you play your cards
You all ain't fucking with me!
The ironies are
And at all costs better before he was bars
Now lets start, on your mark
Get set, lets go-get out the car!
Going in circles, its a vicious cycle
This is a crash course, this ain't high school
Wake up, Muttley, you're dreamin' again
Your own reality show, the season begins

[Chorus]

Step One in this process, scramble up in your projects
And head to the heights where big coke is processed
You gotta convince 'em that you not from the Precinct
Please speak slow, cause he no speakey no English
If he takes a liking after a couple of trips
If your money is straight, he's gonna give you consignment
You're now in a game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts, i wish you well...
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?
How sick am i? I wish you HEALTH
I wish you wheels, i wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
You could see the signs, when the jackets is schemin'
And the cops is comin', you could read they mind
You could see from behind, you could redefine
The game as we know it, one dream at a time
I'm American dreamin'

Without givin' you half of my dough
And even worse if I was broke would you want me?
If I couldn't get you finer things

Like all of them diamond rings bitches kill for
Would you still roll?
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
Would you ride then, if I wasn't drivin'?

If I wasn't ah, eight figure nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me?
If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya

See yourself with a nigga workin' harder than 9 to 5
Contend with six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a balla?
So you can shop and tear the mall up?

Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself
With a nigga when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo

Can I get a fuck you, to these bitches from all of my niggaz
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough?
Can I get a woop woop, to these niggaz from all of my bitches
Who don't got love for niggaz without dubs?

Can I get a fuck you, to these bitches from all of my niggaz

Can you afford me, my niggaz breadwinners, never corny

Ambition makes me, so horny
Not the fussin' and the frontin'
If you got nuttin', baby boy, you betta
"Git up, git out and get somethin'", shit

I like a, lot of P-rada, Alize and Vodka
Late nights, candlelight, then I tear the cock up
Get it up, I put it down every time it pop up, huh
I got to snap 'em, let it loose, then I knock ya

Feel the juice, then I got ya
When you produce a rocka
I let you meet momma and introduce you to poppa
My, coochie remains in a Gucci name

Never test my patience nigga
I'm high maintenance
High class, if you ain't rollin', bypass
If you ain't holdin', I dash yo

Can I get a fuck you, to these bitches from all of my niggaz
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough?
Can I get a woop woop, to these niggaz from all of my bitches
Who don't got love for niggaz without dubs?

Gi-gi-gi-gi, can ya bounce wit' me? Bounce wit' me
Uhh, yeah

It ain't even a question
how my dough flows, I'm good to these bad hoes
Like my bush wet and undry like damp clothes
What y'all niggaz don't know, it's eazy, to pimp a hoe

Bitches betta have my, money fo' sho'
Before they go, runnin' they mouth, promotin' half
I be dickin' they, back out, go 'head, let it out
I fucks with my gat out, bounce and leave a hundred

Makin' 'em feel, slutted even if they don't want it
It's been so long
Since I met a chick, ain't on my tips but then I'm
Dead wrong, when I tell 'em be gone

So hold on to the feelin' of flossin' and platinum
'Cause from now on, you can witness Ja the I-Con
With hoodies and timbs on
'Cause I thugs my bitches

Veve, studs my bitches, then we rob bitch niggaz
I'm talkin' 'bout straight figures
If you here, you wit' us
If not boo, you know what, I still fucked you

Can I get a fuck you, to these bitches from all of my niggaz
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough?
Can I get a woop woop, to these niggaz from all of my bitches
Who don't got love for niggaz without dubs?

Now can you bounce wit' me? Bounce wit' me

Gi-gi-gi-gi, can ya bounce wit' me? Bounce wit' me
Uhh, yeah

It ain't even a question
how my dough flows, I'm good to these bad hoes
Like my bush wet and undry like damp clothes
What y'all niggaz don't know, it's eazy, to pimp a hoe

Bitches betta have my, money fo' sho'
Before they go, runnin' they mouth, promotin' half
I be dickin' they, back out, go 'head, let it out
I fucks with my gat out, bounce and leave a hundred

Makin' 'em feel, slutted even if they don't want it
It's been so long
Since I met a chick, ain't on my tips but then I'm
Dead wrong, when I tell 'em be gone

So hold on to the feelin' of flossin' and platinum
'Cause from now on, you can witness Ja the I-Con
With hoodies and timbs on
'Cause I thugs my bitches

Veve, studs my bitches, then we rob bitch niggaz
I'm talkin' 'bout straight figures
If you here, you wit' us
If not boo, you know what, I still fucked you

Can I get a fuck you, to these bitches from all of my niggaz
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough?
Can I get a woop woop, to these niggaz from all of my bitches
Who don't got love for niggaz without dubs?

Now can you bounce wit' me? Bounce wit' me
Ge-gi, ge-gi-gi-gi bounce wit' me, bounce wit' me

Can I hit in the mornin'
Without givin' you half of my dough
And even worse if I was broke would you want me?
If I couldn't get you finer things

Like all of them diamond rings bitches kill for
Would you still roll?
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
Would you ride then, if I wasn't drivin'?

If I wasn't ah, eight figure nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me?
If I couldn't flow futuristic would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya

See yourself with a nigga workin' harder than 9 to 5
Contend with six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a balla?
So you can shop and tear the mall up?

Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself
With a nigga when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo

Can I get a fuck you, to these bitches from all of my niggaz
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough?
Can I get a woop woop, to these niggaz from all of my bitches
Who don't got love for niggaz without dubs?

Can I get a fuck you, to these bitches from all of my niggaz
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough?
Can I get a woop woop, to these niggaz from all of my bitches
Who don't got love for niggaz without dubs?

Uh uh, Major Coins, Amil-lion
Bounce wit' me, bounce wit' me, uhh, yo bounce wit' me
Can ya, can ya, can ya bounce wit' me? Bounce wit' me
Yeah, uh-uh, uh uh

You ain't gotta be rich but fuck that
How we gonna get around your bus pass
Fo' I put this pussy on your mustache
Can you afford me, my niggaz breadwinners, never corny

Ambition makes me, so horny
Not the fussin' and the frontin'
If you got nuttin', baby boy, you betta
"Git up, git out and get somethin'", shit

I like a, lot of P-rada, Alize and Vodka
Late nights, candlelight, then I tear the cock up
Get it up, I put it down every time it pop up, huh
I got to snap 'em, let it loose, then I knock ya

Feel the juice, then I got ya
When you produce a rocka
I let you meet momma and introduce you to poppa
My, coochie remains in a Gucci name

Never test my patience nigga
I'm high maintenance
High class, if you ain't rollin', bypass
If you ain't holdin', I dash yo

Can I get a fuck you, to these bitches from all of my niggaz
Who don't love hoes, they get no dough?
Can I get a woop woop, to these niggaz from all of my bitches
Who don't got love for niggaz without dubs?

[Jay-Z]
Uh-uhh-uh, ge-ge-geyeah

[Chorus: Blackstreet]
You belong to the city (Uh-uhh-uh, what what)
You belong to the night (Uh-uhh-uh, ge-ge-geyeah)
In the river of darkness
He's a man of the night

[Verse One: Jay-Z]
Uhh, yeah
What the deal playboy, just rest your soul
I be holding it down yo still love the dough
Got these ladies on the cock now you know how we go
Got the whole world on lock down you know how we flow
Don't worry about Brooklyn I continue to flame
Therefore a world with amnesia won't forget your name
You held it down long enough, let me take those reigns
And just like your spirit the commision remains
Niggaz can cross the T's and, dots the I's
Now that I got too popular to cop them pies
I'm takin this rap shit serious, to my demise
Jay shit's like cake mix, watch me rise
Basics in the basement, waste it
Asking my dog for advice so when he can't say shit
my hatred is, fueled just give me a sign
And I let the world know that the city is mine, what?

[Chorus: Blackstreet]
You belong to the city (The city is mine, what-what-what)
You belong to the night (Ge-ge-geyeah, uh-uhh-uh, pa-pau)
In the river of darkness
He's a man of the night (The city is mine, that's right...)

[Verse Two: Jay-Z
Y'all want to know how I flow just seek and you find
I'm like a brain in the voicebox, I speak my mind
About to redefine rap mami, either I'm
the illest nigga doing it or these niggaz is losin it
I read a article that said I was ruinin shit
But every time I look, I'm movin units in quick
So I'ma hit y'all, with these last two and split
and leave niggaz with nothing but my influences-es
Soon it's the Jigga, I ain't mad yeah, bite my shit
Sell half of what I sell because it's not quite my shit
I'm the type to buy a Roley and just ice my shit
on the spot, fuck comin back twice to shit
How real is that? My floss game, still intact
Boss game, you lame dudes can't feel that
Like the first dude to cop the 850 and 89
and drove it up to 55th, the city is mine, what?

[Chorus: Blackstreet]
You belong to the city (The city is mine)
You belong to the night (Yeah, uhh, the city is mine)
In the river of darkness (Pa-pa, feel me)
He's a man of the night (Yeah, yeah, bounce, bounce)

[Verse Three: Jay-Z]
I snatch your girl cause your arm ain't strong enough
Plus ya don't stay in the studio long enough
I make hits while y'all stay hatin and take bricks
Had it locked til I came in the club, Take 6
Got your chick cause you swore she was innocent
Got her a Chinese manicure hair done by Dominicans, all for what
So I could be in a dark corner, all in the butt
at the bar alchoholing her up
I represent the lifestyle of those who thirst cream
A buck fifty a shot, Louis the Thirteenth
Jay-Z, Roc-A-Fella yo, know the name
I ain't a player get it right, I'm controllin the game
From now until they blow holes in my frame
I'ma stand firm, holdin my aim, feel me?
I'm the focal, point like Biggie in his prime
on the low though - shhhhh, the city is mine!

You're now tuned into the motherfucking greatest
Turn the music up in the headphones
Tim, you can go and brush your shoulder off nigga
I got you, yeah

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
If you feeling like a pimp nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder

[Verse One]
I probably owe it to you all, proud to be locked by the force
Trying to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche
Feeling no remorse, feeling like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga griping my balls
All the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screaming
All the ballers is bouncing they like the way I be leaning
All the rappers be hating, off the track that I'm making
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the "Top of the Pops"
Nigga London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back nigga 'cause I'm straight with the Rock

[Chorus]

[Chorus Two]
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get, that, dirt off your shoulder

[Verse Two]
Your homey Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, trying to get me a Rover
Trying to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yes sir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test you
But like, fifty-two cards when I'm, I'm through dealing
Now fifty-two bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling
In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chilling
with a boss bitch of course S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

[Chorus + Chorus Two]

[Verse Three]
Your boy back in the building, Brooklyn we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bitch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest that run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black
I drop that +Black, Album+ then I back, out it
As the best rapper alive nigga ask about me
From Bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammies
The O's to opposite, Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for selling out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey
I'm a hustler homey, you a customer crony
Got some, dirt on my shoulder, could you brush it off for me?

took it to my stash spot, 
Five Sixty Stage street, 
catch me in the kitchen like a simmons whipping pastry, 
cruising down 8th street, 
off white lexus, 
driving so slow but BK is from Texas, 
me I’m up at Bedsty, 
home of that boy Biggie, 
now i live on billboard, 
and i brought my boys with me, 
say wat up to Ty Ty, still sipping Malta 
sitting courtside Knicks and Nets give me high fives, 
N-gga i be spiked out, i can trip a referee, 
tell by my attitude that I most definitely from…

[Jay-Z]

you should know I bleed Blue, but I aint a crip tho, 
but i got a gang of n-ggas walking with my click though, 
welcome to the melting pot, 
corners where we selling rocks, 
afrika bambaataa sh-t, 
home of the hip hop, 
yellow cap, gypsy cap, dollar cab, holla back, 
for foreigners it aint fitted they forgot how to act, 
8 million stories out there and their naked, 
cities is a pity half of y’all won’t make it, 
me i gotta plug a special and i got it made, 
If Jesus payin LeBron, I’m paying Dwayne Wade,

Statue of Liberty, long live the World trade, 
long live the king yo,

lets here it for New York, New York, New York 
Welcome to the bright light.. 

[Jay-Z] 
Lights is blinding, 
girls need blinders 
so they can step out of bounds quick, 
the side lines is blind with casualties, 
who sipping life casually, then gradually become worse, 
don’t bite the apple Eve, 
caught up in the in crowd, 
now your in-style, 
and in the winter gets cold en vogue with your skin out, 
the city of sin is a pity on a whim, 
good girls gone bad, the cities filled with them, 
Mommy took a bus trip and now she got her bust out, 
everybody ride her, just like a bus route, 
Hail Mary to the city your a Virgin, 
and Jesus can’t save you life starts when the church ends, 
came here for school, graduated to the high life, 
ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight, 
MDMA got you feeling like a champion, 
the city never sleeps better slip you a Ambien 

[Chorus] 

In New York, 
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of, 
Theres nothing you can’t do, 
Now you’re in New York, 
these streets will make you feel brand new, 
the lights will inspire you, 
lets here it for New York, New York, New York 


[Alicia Keys] 
One hand in the air for the big city, 
Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty, 
no place in the World that can compare, 
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeaaahh 
come on, come, 
yeah, 

[Chorus] 

In New York, 
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of, 
Theres nothing you can’t do, 
Now you’re in New York, 
these streets will make you feel brand new, 
the lights will inspire you, 
lets here it for New York, New York, New York

[Jay-Z]
Check the bassline out, uh-huh
Jigga (bounce wit it), uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh, yeahh
Let it bump though

["Annie" sample]
It's the hard knock life (uh-huh) for us
It's the hard knock life, for us!!
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!!

[Jay-Z]
From standin on the corners boppin
to drivin some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For droppin some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
fleein the murder scene, you know me well
from nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggaz know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggaz with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me mom I rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not
let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot
let's stick up the world and split it fifty/fifty, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter 
nigga Volume 2, y'all niggaz get ready

["Annie" sample]
It's the hard knock life, for us 
It's the hard knock life, for us!!
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!!

[Jay-Z]
I flow for those 'dro'ed out; all my niggaz 
locked down in the ten by fo', controllin the house
We live in hard knocks, we don't take over we borrow blocks
Burn em down and you can have it back daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin, they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see you vision mama, I put my money on the longshots
[ From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/j/jay,,Z-lyrics/hard-knock-life-(Ghetto-anthem)-lyrics.html ]
All my ballers that's born to clock
Now I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot; sleepin on futons and cots
to King Size, dream machines, the green fives
I've seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type braile
I'm tight grill with the phony, rappers y'all might feel we homies
I'm like still, y'all don't know me, shit!
I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin
I'm tryin to murder everything movin, feel me?!

["Annie" sample]
It's the hard knock life, for us 
It's the hard knock life, for us!!
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life, for us 
It's the hard knock life, for us!!
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!! 

[Jay-Z]
I don't how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Gotta a lot of beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustling's still inside of me, and as far as progress
you'd be hard-pressed, to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it, til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, X'ed your name out
Put Jigga on top, and drop albums non-stop for ya, nigguh!

["Annie" sample]
It's the hard knock life, for us 
It's the hard knock life, for us!!
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life, for us 
It's the hard knock life, for us!!
Steada treated, we get tricked
Steada kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!!
.. It's the hard knock life!!
.. It's the hard knock life!!---Lyrics submitted by Elly.

You take the clothes off my back
And I let you
You steal the food right out my mouth
And I watch you eat it
I still don’t know why
Why I love you so much
Ohhh
You curse my name
In spite to put me to shame
Air all my laundry in the streets
Dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much
Yea

And It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack ya code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here
One day you there
One day you care
You're so unfair
Sipping from the cup
Till it runneth over
Holy Grail

Blue told me to remind you niggas
Fuck that shit y’all talking about
I'm the nigga
Caught up in all these lights and cameras
But look what that shit did to Hammer
Goddammit it I like it
The bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
30 mill for one fight
But soon as all the money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame
Keep cheating on me
What I do
I took her back
Fool me twice
That's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me want to murder
Momma please just get my bail
I know
Nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain
I did it to myself

And we all just
Entertainers
And we're stupid
And contagious
And we all just
Entertainers
And we're stupid
And contagious

And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack ya code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here
One day you there
One day you care
You're so unfair
Sipping from your cup
Till it runneth over
Holy Grail

Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper
Photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough
I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though
I'm getting high
Sitting low
Sliding by
In that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt
But this chain works
I think back
You asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with
It, this shit ain't work
This light work
Camera snapping my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your IRIS and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas
Will die for
Dry yours
Why you mad
Take the good with the bad
Don't throw that baby out with the bath water
You're still alive
Still that nigga
Tou survived
You still getting bigger nigga
Living the life
Vanilla wafers
In a villa
Illest nigga alive
Michael Jackson thriller

And It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack ya code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you here
One day you there
One day you care
You're so unfair
Sipping from the cup
Till it runneth over
Holy Grail

Don't know why
Love you so much---

I'm a hyphen hater
If you are inbetween my words
I'll see you later
Cos I'm a hyphen hater
You are silent when I speak
But I can see you on paper

You are higher than an underscore
But no more
To me, you're as dead as Latin
I can't even hear you, when I am chattin'

'Z' comes after 'Y'
We all know that
So why did you have to get involved?
Like some big man dat

Was there something wrong with my grammar?
Well now it doesn't matter
My name is four letters
Split by the button which is fatter

You are only good for pause
But when I got my flow
No one will stop me
Until I bring the applause

My alphabet goes from Jay to Zee
You are not a proper letter
So that that is why, I have decided
That a space is much better

This should not be a surprise to you
Your kind of character was up for being dismissed
So now that you are free
Go catch some vibes with brother asterisk

Forward slash, back slash, hash tag, comma
No thank you
Only the alphabet will do
I'm keepin' it simple with syllable two

After zero is where you belong
At the end of all those numbers is where you are strong
Sharing with cousin underscore
Plus and equals sitting next door

All is not lost, you have set a legacy
On websites, tickets, records and CD
This is not the end
You were more than a connector, you were my friend
There is a new journey on the horizon
Go and enjoy life by saying 'Hi Fun!' ---

Yessir! 
Just the sound of his voice is a hit! 
Ya'll niggas got me really confused out there 
I make "Big Pimpin" or "Give It 2 Me", one of those... 
Ya'll hail me as the greatest writer of the 21st Century 
I make some thought-provoking shit 
Ya'll question whether he falling off 
I'ma really confuse ya'll on this one 
Follow.... 

When them tops come down, chicks tops come down 
Like when them shots come out make cops come around 
When the blocks come out I can wake up a small town 
Finish off the block then I make my mall rounds 
When them stares get exchanged then the 5th come out 
The tough guy disappears then the bitch come out 
"That's him" -I'm usually what they whisper about 
Either what chick he with, or his chip amount 
Cause I been doing this since CHIPS was out 
Watchin' Erik Estrada baggin' up at the Ramada 
Table full of powder, AC Broke 
'Bout to take another shower on my 25th hour 
Spike Lee's everywhere, game or the flight 
You might see me anywhere, day in the life 
Only thing changed the tail number on the flight 
I can touch down and take off the same night 

I'm so bossy 
Bitch get off me 
Trick get off me 
You cant get shit off me 
I'm so flossy 
No 6-exhaust breeze 
laid back, Maybach's 
Don't even talk to me! 

This is that ignorant shit you like 
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus ice 
C'mon, I got that ignorant shit you love 
Nigga, fuck, shit, maricon, puta, and drugs 
C'mon, I got that ignorant shit you need 
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick plus weed 
I'm only trying to give you what you want 
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, you like it don't front 

They're all actors 
Looking at themselves in the mirror backwards 
Can't even face themselves, don't fear no rappers 
They're all weirdos, DeNiro's in Practice 
So don't believe everything your earlobe captures 
Its mostly backwards 
Unless it happens to be as accurate as me 
And everything said in song you happen to see 
Then actually, believe half of what you see 
None of what you hear even if its spat by me 
And with that said, I will kill niggas dead 
Cut niggas short, give you wheels for legs 
Im a K-I- double -L-E-R 
See ya'll in hell 
Shoot niggas straight through the E.R. 
Whoa- this ain't B.R., no 
Its S.C., C.E.O., the next Lyor? 
No, the next leader of the whole free world 
And the first thing i'ma do is free Sigel, GO! 

Take off the cuffs, unlock the gate 
Its that ignorant nigga that you love to hate 
The '07 Ice Cube, B. Sig so rude 
Tell a trick, get these nuts, eat dick like food 
Now see if I care if this verse get aired 
Even if you mute it the curse is there, yeah 
I'm so raunchy, bitch get off me 
Keep my flea collar on, you lil ticks get off me! 

I missed the part where it stopped being about Imus 
What do my lyrics got to do with this SHIT? 
SCARFACE the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me 
Still that ain't the blame for all the shit that's happened to me 
Are you saying what I'm spitting, 
Is worse than these celebutantes showin' they kitten, you kidding? 
Lets stop the bullshittin' 
Til' we all without sin, let's quit the pulpit-ing 
SCARFACE the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me 
Still that ain't the blame for all the shit that's happened to me 
Lets stop the bullshittin' 
Til' we all without sin, let's quit the pulpit-ing, c'mon! 

This is that ignorant shit you like 
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus ice 
C'mon, I got that ignorant shit you love 
Nigga, fuck, shit, maricon, puta, and drugs 
C'mon, I got that ignorant shit you need 
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick plus weed 
I'm only trying to give you what you want 
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, you like it don't front---Lyrics submitted by Juwan.
