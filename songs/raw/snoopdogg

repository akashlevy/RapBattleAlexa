Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
(Snoop) Pump that up G
(Tupac) Ahh shit, you done fucked up now -- Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
You done put two of America's
most wanted in the same
motherfuckin place at the same Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
motherfuckin time, hahahahah
Y'all niggaz about to feel this Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
Break out the champagne glasses
and them motherfuckin condoms
Have one on us aight?? Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party

Verse One: 2Pac, Snoop

Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg my fuckin homey
Youse a cold ass nigga on them hogs

Sho nuff, I keep my hand on my gun, cuz they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom waitin on the outcome
Free Tupac, is all that's on a niggaz mind
But at the same time it seem they tryin to take mine
So I'ma get smart, and get defensive and shit
And put together a million march, for some gangsta shit

So now they got us laced
Two multimillionare motherfuckers catchin cases (mmm)
Bitches get ready for the throwdown, the shit's about to go down
Uhh, me and Snoop about to clown
I'm Losin My Religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin
Niggaz be actin like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I got, nuthin but love, for my niggaz livin lavish

I got a pit named P, she niggarino
I got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
and I, think I got a black Beamer
but my dream is to own a fly casino
like Bugsy Seigel, and do it all illegal
and get scooped up, by the little homie in the Regal
Mmm, it feel good to you baby bubba
Ya see, this is for the G's and the keys motherfucker

Now follow as we riiiiide
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the West side
And I can make you famous
Niggaz been dying for years, so how could they blame us
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin these, motherfuckin G's
If ya got it better flaunt it, another warrant

Nuthin but a gangsta party

Verse Two: 2Pac, Snoop

Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck wit me
I bust and flea, these niggaz must be crazy what??
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can fade the Thugs
(hahah right) You thought it was but it wasn't, now dissapear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

It's like cuz, blood, gangbanging
Everybody in the party doing dope slangin
You got to have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch, before your eyes swerl
Ya doing ya job, every day
And then you work so hard till ya hair turn gray
Let me tell you about life, and bout the way it is
You see we live by the gun, so we die by the gun's kids

They tell me not to roll with my glock
So now I gotta throat of rage
Floatin in the black Benz, tryin to do a show a day
They wonder how I live, with five shots
Niggaz is hard to kill, on my block
Keep a promise see if you're related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, try to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted

Chorus---Lyrics submitted by Tadasku.

When you're awake
When lightening strikes you know
When you're awake
It definitely starts glowing
All the girls that's in this room
Get up close, you'll feel so much better
It feels so good to know
When you're awake
With the G come to the light

Put your hands together and close your eyes
Smell the aroma, visualise
Do not try to get higher than me
Why stop it there? Get high as can be

It's time to spark up some ...
Feel the blaze
The ... number one (there's nothing new under the sun)
Feel the awake

My name is Snoop Dogg, not to complain
I gets my groove on, I do my thing
My planet's Krypton, home of the freaks
Come get your moon rocks, I am a G---

Jimmy Bones, I, dig the way you move, 
Your also sexy, smooth
You turn me on and I see
What you really mean to me
And all I ever wanna be
Is right here with my boo
Its been a long time
Boy I miss you.

Jimmy Bones why,
Did you have to leave me this way,
You left me feelin' dis way
So I'm happy I pray, for piece of mind
Piece of mind, piece of mind, i give all,
It hurts so bad to know.

Chorus:
But he was bad to his bones
Good love at home
So bad, bad to his bones (oooo)
Good love at home
Bad to his bones, baby I, can understand how making love, 
I can loose a man, I need you back, in my life to stay 
But until than,
I wait for the day, for the day, for the day 
I wait for the day, for you to come back to me (ooohhhh).

Jimmy Bones, it's fortunate you had to go,
I needed time to let you know,
How much I really love you... So, so, so, so, so, so
But lately throughout time,
Something strange is going down,
And I feel you in my soul, 
Just like a fella long time ago,
So that I call your name out 'jimmy'
And I break down and start to cry,
On my knees screaming my, my
Lord I wish I could die to,
I'd still be right there beside side you
This ain't no money loving, I do,
Couldn't get away, if I tried to,

Ohhhh Jimmy, he left me all alone
But he was, bad, bad to his bones (ooohhhhhh)
Good love at home,
Bad so bad, to his bones, 
So bad but good love at home (good love, good love)
Bad to his bones

Chorus:
Baby I, can't understand how making love, 
I can loose a man, I need you back, in my life to stay 
But until than, I wait for the day, 
I wait for the day, for the day 
For the day, bad to his bones, 
To his bones,good love at home
So bad, bad to his bones (oooo)
Good love at home, bad to his bones (x3)---Lyrics submitted by Cherine.

Back in the days you was a girl I went to school wit
Had to tell your moms and sister to cool it (Oh-hooo!)
The girl wanna do it, I just might do it
Here to walk wit some pimp-pimp fluid
Mommy don't worry, I won't abuse it
Hurry up and finish so we can watch "Clueless" (Oh-hooo!)
I laugh at these niggas when they ask who do this
But everybody know who girl that you is

[Chorus 2X's]

[Verse 2]
When I see my baby boo, shit, I get foolish
Smack a nigga that tries to pursue it (Oh-hooo!)
Homeboy, she taken, just move it
I asked you nicely, don't make the Dogg lose it
We just blow 'dro and keep the flow movin'
In a '64, me and baby boo cruisin' (Oh-hooo!)
Body rag interior blue, and
Have them hydralics squeakin' when we screwin'
Now she's yellin', hollerin' out Snoop, and
Hootin', hollerin'; hollerin', hootin' (Oh-hooo!)
Black and beautiful, you the one I'm choosin'
Hair long and black and curly like you're Cuban
Keep groovin', that's what we doin'
And we gon' be together until your moms move in... (Oh-hooo!)

You got my pictures on the wall in your room-in (Oh-hooo!)
Girls be complainin' you keep me boomin'
But girls like that wanna listen to Pat Boone (Ehh... oh yeah, there's
something about you...)
You's a college girl, but that don't stop you from doin'
Come and see the Dogg in a hood near you-in (Oh-hooo!)
You don't ask why I roll wit a crew, and
Twist up my fingers and wear dark blue-in (Ehh... oh yeah, there's something
about you...)
On the eastside, that's the crew I choose
Nothin' I do is new to you (Oh-hooo!)
I smack up the world if they rude to you (Ehh...)
'Cause baby girl you so beautiful...

You say roll, don't you know that I'm from round here?
Well girl I like the way you roll

So if you wanna go to Melrose

And then we'll go to Venice
You roll so good you might as well let me hit it
For like 15 minutes
Girl, you never gon' forget it
And if you wanna go around town

And if you wanna go downtown
You might as well roll with a real nigga
I'm not talking 'bout them fools

And when I hand you that weed and I ask if you can roll?
You say no, let me show you around here
Cowgirl wanna roll with a winner
Rodeo with a winner, Rodeo loud yeah

Just tell 'em what my name is
You heard about me, you heard all about me
Mean you heard all the hittas that I'm with gangbanging
But I ain't talking 'bout the news
Girl you know that I'm talking 'bout you

Oh you got a gun so you wanna pop back?

Ate more bitches in the lobby on the molly
Pretty sexy yet exotic fill em all in my Ferrari yep

Got em running upstairs got em coming in pairs
May I relieve you of your jacket can I touch you there
She took off her underwear, it ain't no hair under there

Where you at?

[Chorus:]
[Nate Dogg]
Ridin in my car
And I'm listening to the radio
I'm listening to a sad girl sing
Sing about how she got her heart broke
You were reaching for stars
I just want me something natural
When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as if you did not know
She let me play with her heart
I'm working late I said I'll soon be home
All the while the girl was home alone
Let me tell you what she crying for (Why?)
Cuz I'm fly

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah he super sly
NATE DOGG!

[Nate Dogg]
Ohh ohh ohh I'm fly, yaaaa

[Snoop Dogg]
You know he supa sly
But me I'm supa dupa and I'm supa dupa fly
I'd be the great at this I know you waited this
And I wanted this to be elaborate and so strenuous
And then you just slide by and wiz-ave
You on another piz-age
Is that the way you gon be-hiz-ave?
I know you're feeling all hurt inside
But won't you talk to a playa?
Let me help out your pride
I'm like a counselor, a pastor, a priest or a physchologist
A shrink... on a freak
Peep (my) my technique
And I wear minks, gator boots
And I'm the rip that gets the loot
And I ain't afraid to shoot
And I love to toot toot
Beep beep as I slide up the street
I'm from the LBC and I don't know what y'all done heard about me
But I'm a C-R-I-P with some P-I-M-P too
I'm a real pimp playa from the 213 crew
Now look here boo
If you gonna bang or hang with tha dogg
You best to get in
Holla at her Nate Dogg (Holla, holla)

[Chorus:]
[Nate Dogg]
Ridin in my car
And I'm listening to the radio
I'm listening to a sad girl sing
Sing about how she got her heart broke
You were reaching for stars (umm)
I just want me something natural (Is that right Nate Dogg?)
When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as (Check this out) if you did not know
She let me play with her heart
I'm working late I said I'll soon be home (Damn nigga)
All the while the girl was home alone
Let me tell you what she crying fo' (Why?)
(What she cryin for?)
Cuz I'm fly

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah he super sly
NATE DOGG! (Yeah)

[Nate Dogg]
Ohh ohh ohh I'm fly, yaaaa

[Warren G]
Warren G..
3 piece with a mink
Gotta think my shit stinks
Stacy Adams with a drink
Pockets pad up, they come from Brinks
So what the ladies wink
You the one in the Mercedes
Shotgun with the thing
Coat chillin watchin "The Lion King"
Crying and thangs
Cus I'm with Snoop and Nate, singing, rhyming and things
I'm out late cus I'm rhyming for change
I ain't with dime for dames
Hop back and I'm trying to aim..
At everything, that be hating my fame
Since regulatin, been lacing the game
Ain't no mistake in the game
Two-one mother f'in dwizzle sippin on the sizzle
And that's for shizzle
Four times for da riddles
You know these bars
Everywhere we go...you know who us are
You could tell by the car
Champagne caviar
Bubble bath, I say I love you..
And I laugh

[Chorus:]
[Nate Dogg]
Ridin in my car
And I'm listening to the radio
I'm listening to a sad girl sing
Sing about how she got her heart broke
You were reaching for stars
I just want me something natural
When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as if you did not know
She let me play with her heart
I'm working late I said I'll soon be home
All the while the girl was home alone
Let me tell you what she crying fo' (Why?)
Cuz I'm fly

[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah he super sly (super fly)
NATE DOGG!

[Snoop Dogg]
West Coast... it's time to stand up nigga
We gon' unite 'round this motherfucker one time
I'm callin' every real Crip nigga
and every real B-Dogg, to the table right now
Yeah... we gon' push a real line right now
See if y'all with this real gangsta guerrilla shit

Have you ever seen 100,000 Rip riders from the side
Blue Chuck's, blue rags, grey clouds, blue skies
On the move, can't lose, Hill Street blues
Niggaz gotta pay they dues on the crews or with the uzi spray
these suckas then I cruise, my granny saw it on the news
She shook up, look up and then she put me on the move
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
Cause the homies had the loop-loop that night at King Park
And I got into a squab, got caught and went to jail
Straight to the County with no motherfuckin' bail
4800 with this Crippin', oh well
My big homie Boy Blue snatched me by my coattail
He said trip Dogg, ya better get right, Crip right
Eyes open 'cause niggaz get stuck on seez-ight
It ain't no motherfuckin' problem - pop-pop, tick-tock
Never flip-flop, 20 Crippin' til I drop

[Chorus]
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip

[The Game]
Is I, in the motherfuckin' S-5
With the red bandana double knotted 'round the rearview
Niggaz see clear through, they know that it's Game
Cherry red Lowenhart's let 'em know that I bang
So bang, like Snoop in "Deep Cover"
I got the seat reclined, fo-five under the white-T, smothered
Dippin' down Green Leaf, I ain't got no enemies
Been shot five times, now I bleed Hennessy
And bang for my niggaz locked up, they can't stop us
It ain't a gangsta party 'til we go and dig Pac up
I'm Dr. Martin Luther King with two guns on
Hughey P. Lewis with Air Force One's on
I gangbang but I'm the opposite of Tookie Williams
Red Lambo', red bandana print ceilin'
Me and Snoop got the West Coast locked
Red and blue rag tied in a knot
With all my motherfuckin' homies yellin' out

[Chorus]
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip

[The Game]
I ran outta gas in Long Beach, I'm stuck
Ain't no Bloods and all I see is blue Chuck's
Hopped out the '6-trey, nowhere to go
Til' Snoop pulled up in that Pittsburgh Steeler '6-4
We "Just Dippin", one Bloodin' one Crippin'
I'm on that Bulls shit, throwback Scott' Pippen
Moral is, my bandana hangin' from the left side
So if you ain't a Crip or a Blood, just throw up Westside

[Snoop Dogg]
(What up Blood?) Yeah cuz, we just tippin'
Me and Game doin' thangs, switchin' lanes, Hurricanes on my feet
Stop, and C-Walk to the beat
Game, take the wheel and turn on 21st Street
Eastside LBC, gun in my hand
It's the turf by the surf but we don't play in the sand
We just - slip and slide out, we Rip and ride out
Let it C known, nigga welcome to the Thunderdome

[Chorus]
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
So whooot, so whooot, so whooot, so whooot
Ca-rip, Ca-rip, Ca-rip...---Lyrics submitted by LARON.

She always cold in the middle of the night

That's what I aim fo, that's how the game go
Baby like the way I wake her up, 
Coz ima gangsta I grab her by the butt
Pull her to my side, I'm in deep
Woke that ass up, just to put her to sleep
Everyday is the same thang, I creep in
It's like true blood, I sink my teeth in
I gotta have it, the L B raisement
We was taught to dig em down crazy
Lights out, I'm so lit
Mama's so gone, daddy wont quit

[Snoop dogg] [verse]
This the life that yu show
The loop, the coop, the grows
Anything goes
It's so good got her wiggling her toes (wow)
The boss, the dream
The floss, the cream
The trips overseas
All these things really don't mean a thing
When I'm tearing that ass up workin yu like a shift
I give it to yu like a gift
Yu hear what that boy say
Yu wouldn't jack, give it up fast
Then I hit it from the back
Snoopy your so good, she screaming & I like that girl
She off in another world.
I aint stop till yur finished
She love this gangsta, espically when I'm in it. Dream
