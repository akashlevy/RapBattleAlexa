one, two, three...three

yo in linear terms my 33rd degree in the 3rd 
words'll give you 33rd degree burns
first i write 33 lines to a verse about 
how i created the earth out of 33 works
33 of my peers never thought it would work
for 33 days i started my relentless research
and i figured if jigga could do 22 2s 
as an MC then i could do 33 3s
suddenly at the tour at 3:30 on march 3rd
it came to me like gods word 
i started to load my 33 calibre mossberg
went to the top of the empire state on 33rd
33 gunshots was heard 33 
pedestrians lay wounded or dead on the kerb
33 squad cars had rushed to the scene 
as soon as they heard some mad man had gone buzurk
i demanded 33 million or i was gonna kill 33 
of the women and children in the building
i gave em 33 minutes to respond then proceeded to arm
my black pack nuclear bomb
set the timer for 3 hours and 3 minutes long
told em not to try nothin funny or i'd kill em all
they still never responded till i saw 33
of the swat team jump out of 3 hellicopters
i told em for the 3rd and final time
if they cross the line again then i'd take 33 lives
3 of the hostages started cryin
3 of them started wildin im convinced
3 more then started uprisin
3 of em stood to they feet and started freestylin
i didnt know what to do so i started rhymin
i tried to kick 300 bars but i got picked off
by a sniper from 33 yards
the bullet hit me but it got lodged and ricocheted off
3 organs 3 inches away from my heart
my name went down in history as the illest MC
rewindin and countin 33 3s---Lyrics submitted by steve.

Give me control of all the world's media 
And I care not who they choose to let entertain 'em 
Radio, audio, television, video 
Satellite, streaming, download, digital 
Give me control of all the world's media 
And I care not who they choose to let entertain 'em 
Radio, audio, television, video 
Satellite, streaming, download, digital 

For the Phoenix to rise, life must die 
And that's just how it is sometimes 
The narrow path is not always clear cut but don't fear nothing 
Good karma will amount to something 
The 1990 era was the most special 
We took this art form to a whole 'nother level 
We had supreme knowledge, Hip Hop Temple Stone Pilots 
All-seeing eyes with the gold iris 
The material world is not always truthful 
Everybody can't be a business management guru 
Gimme Guinness stout, I sit around the table at Google 
Meditate, learn the Mennonite language from YouTube 
Raw talent force multiplier enforcer 
The Universe bleeds from every orifice, I absorb it 
Silver garments smell like garlic, camp-fire concert performers 
My Last Supper was a cup of cornmeal porridge 
The horizon is dark orange, the Phoenix rise, close orbit 
I see armies of 9-foot Wookies in the forest 
Transcendence, this is artificial dependence 
The future is present, my name is Johnny Depp Junior [Jetson] 

Give me control of all the world's media 
And I care not who they choose to let entertain 'em 
Radio, audio, television, video 
Satellite, streaming, download, digital 

Control the whole world's media 
Why would you care who they choose to let entertain 'em? 
Radio, audio, television, video 
Satellite, streaming, download, digital 
Give me control of all the world's media 
And I care not who they choose to let entertain 'em 
Radio, audio, television, video 
Satellite, streaming, download, digital 
Give me control of all the world's media 
And I care not who they choose to let entertain 'them---
