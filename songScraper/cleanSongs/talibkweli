Yeah as a kid growin up in Brooklyn
My pops was a DJ he had a bunch of records
Funk Jazz Rythm Blues Soul
There was this one Gospel record I liked
Like like like Holy Moly I might kiss a religion and leave you holy holy
This rhyme is so phat its rolypoly
I give you intimite detals so you can get to know me
These corporate rappers like why this dude pickin one me
You rap your way to the top but now its gettin lonely
Kids is hungry and you lookin like a steak from Nick Tony
But dont no body want your jewels cuz your sht is phony
You say boy your shit is real damn your shit is corny
Your rhymes turn into page like Mark Foley
And touch kids like when Larry Clark gave the part to Chloe
Rest in peace to Harold Hunter the greatest from New York
Started out skatin to Zoo York
Hagin out at The Gavin I was very lucky
To talk to Rash once I got past Derek Dudley
Got him on Respiration thats a prebadu
Bet you Garnett Reid got a Matt Doo tattoo
Sometimes I feel like im drownin I gotta tread water
Head above the water I always remember head quarters
Head up eyes open I got my mind focused
I find hope inside a line my rhymes define opus
Sometimes hope is people fill my thoats with evil
My records so hard it broke the needle
At the mixtape awards nias act like they dont give a fuk though
Disrespect the legacy of Justo
What the blood clot No let the blood flow
You aint come to pay your respect Then what chu come fo
Do many good nias die like a stop loss hood nias ghetto like fried wings and hot sauce
How you hard the cops lettin 50 shots off
Baby JayZ with the knock off Scott Storch BEAT
You are not short you are not cat
You not a player or a pimp money stop that
Learn to master your speech and be eloquent
Rappers keep peddlin sweets the beats weaker than gelatin
We used to kick up dust now we settlin
Rest in peace to Dilla Weldon we cant forget you Professor X and Proof we miss you
Rest in peace to Shaka twenty one gun salute In the air like BLOK BLOK BLOK
Youre still here cause youre livin through me
Youre like a gift God has given to me
Uh uh uh whatLyrics submitted by Gino
Cmon cmon ya ya ya ya ya
Get em up get em up what
Get em up get em up what
Get em up get em up what
Fellas wanna hover in my cypher like a helicopter
Like its a special honor
The stealth bomba gem droppa
Make the ghetto holla InterContaNental
Takin you high like sky divers
When we spark with live wires
Original cavemen quest for my fire
Express my desire to drop this new shit
These record executives keep tellin me yall stupid
Now if they right Shut The Fuck Up
Revolutionaries throw your guns up
Whether you a bourgeois broad who actin stuck up
Or some ignorant thug motherfucker shootin the club up
We gonna make yall feel this break yall spirit
If yall fake that realness word we bringin it
Ringin it in from the new millenuim to way after that
I call these cats Reynolds cuz they plastic wrap
Kill all the yappin lets make it happen
You cats aint real you just a reenactment
Soon as the director say action you start fakin
The whole joint start shakin
This aint the time or place for you to prove something
Cut the stargazin yo move somethin
womans voice and Talib Kweli
Word alright bring it back to the top
Lets see whats next up on the menu run up in you
Lyrics that be fuckin with you
In the mental pick any mental instru funda detri
Extra Extra large like the borough of brooklyn the residential
Like Sly Stone wit my poem and fly song
Ride along with cats who live great and die strong word
We gonna rock till nothin else matters
Yall catch bodies we catch excellent cadavers
Your next of kin an shatter stories splattered in the tabloids
Erase your trace like your cotton mouth and we pepperment altoids
Step in the high reppin the spot called flatbush
Whether rappers or actors you still feel the gat bust
The abstract then becomes the reality
Alcoholics like to call it the moment of clarity
Kill all the yappin lets make it happen
You cats aint real you just a reenactment
Soon as the director say action you start fakin
The whole joint start shakin
This aint the time or place for you to prove something
Cut the stargazin yo move somethin
womans voice and Talib Kweli
Move Somethin move somthinLyrics submitted by Edgar Arellano
