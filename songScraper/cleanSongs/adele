I will leave my heart at the door
I wont say a word
Theyve all been said before you know
So why dont we just play pretend
Like were not scared of what is coming next
Or scared of having nothing left
Look dont get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like Im more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again
I dont need your honesty
Its already in your eyes
And Im sure my eyes they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since youre the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to
Look dont get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like Im more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I dont wanna be cruel or vicious
And I aint asking for forgiveness
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like Im more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again
My heart on my sleeve
For days on end and
Its been waiting for you
Just you baby come on now
Im trying to tell you just how
Id like to hear the words
Roll out of your mouth finally
Say that its always been me
Thats made you feel a way
And Im all you need
And that you never want more
Like Im the one for you
That youre just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you
It dont mean that much to me
Youre just a filler in the space
That happened to be free
With trying to play me
I think Ive tried my hardest
It turns out it aint enough
What am I supposed to do
To make you want me properly
My hardest you back to her
And I think that I know
Im still hoping one day
I might hear you say
I make you feel a way
And Im all you need
And that you never want more
Like Im the one for you
That youre just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you
It dont mean that much to me
Youre just a filler in the space
That happened to be free
With trying to play me
The truth that I know
I find it hard to let go
And give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me
The more eager I am
And I think that I know
Im still hoping one day
I might hear you say
I make you feel a way
And Im all you need
And that you never want more
And youll be the one for me
And me the one for youLyrics submitted by Leandra
Ive made up my mind
Dont need to think it over
if Im wrong I am right
Dont need to look no further
i know this is love but
If i tell the world
Cause it was not said to you
And thats exactly what i need to do
If im in love with you
Or should i just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste
Even If i knew my place should i leave it there
Or should i just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere
And fly around in circles
Wait then as my heart drops
and my back begins to tingle
finally could this be it ah
Or should i just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste
Even If i knew my place should i leave it there
Or should i just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere

You say its all in my head
And the things I think
So where you been then
Dont turn it round on me
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shotts me each and every time
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with workds made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
These days when I see you
You make it look like Im see through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart aint in it and youre not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
Im starting to find myself feeling that way too when
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at m e and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
Time and time again I play the role of fool
And even in the daylight when your gaming
I try to look for thing I hear
But my eyes never find
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was herLyrics submitted by mika
Found myself today singing out your name
if I am Im crazy for you
Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
but its you who makes me lose my head
And every time Im meant to be acting sensible
you drift into my head
and turn me into a crumbling fool
Tell me to run and Ill race
if you want me to stop Ill freeze
and if you are me gonna leave just hold me closer baby
and make me crazy for you
Lately with this state Im in I cant help myself but spin
I wish youd come over
send me spinning closer to you
My oh my how my blood boils its sweet taste for you
and gets me into my favourite mood
I keep on trying fighting these feelings away
but the more I do
the crazier I turn into
Pacing floors and opening doors
because Im too crazy for you
Crazy for youLyrics submitted by Leandra
He is a real lover
And making up the past
Like hes never felt a figure before
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back oh
You can find him sittin on your doorstep
And he will feel like hes been there for hours
And you can tell that hell be there for life
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus hes there for you
But he stays all the same
Just what Im hoping for
But I will find him sittin on my doorstep
And he will feel like hes been there for hours
And I can tell that hell be there for life
And I can tell that hell be there for life
He is a real lover
Of making up the past
And feeling up his girl
Like hes never felt her figure before
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back oh
You can find him sittin on your doorstep
And he will feel like hes been there for hours
And you can tell that hell be there for life
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus hes there for you
But he stays all the same
Just what Im hoping for
But I will find him sittin on my doorstep
And he will feel like hes been there for hours

When will I see you again
You left with no goodbye not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any sins
I had no idea of the state we were in
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and heaviness in my head
But dont you remember Dont you remember
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
When was the last time you thought of me
Or have you completely erased me from your memory
I often think about where I went wrong
the more I do The less I know
But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head
But dont you remember Dont you remember
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
I gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
And hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me
Why dont you remember Dont you remember
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
When will I see you again
When will I see you again
You left with no goodbye not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any sins
I had no idea of the state we were in
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and heaviness in my head
But dont you remember Dont you remember
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
When was the last time you thought of me
Or have you completely erased me from your memory
I often think about where I went wrong
the more I do The less I know
But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye and a heaviness in my head
But dont you remember Dont you remember

I gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
And hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me
Why dont you remember Dont you remember
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
When will I see you again
The words are in my mind
The one where you smile
When I start to cry
I need to get away
This love has dried up
I need to taste the kiss
Forgive me first love 4x
Forgive me first love 2xLyrics submitted by Leandra
Some say Ill be better without you
But they dont know you like I do
Or at least the sides I thought I knew
I cant beg this time
It drags on as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
Like notes and clothes you left behind
Wake me up wake me up when all is done
I wont rise until this battles won
I cant do it on my own
If this aint love then what is
Im willing to take the risk
I cant do it on my own
If this aint love then what is
Im willing to take the risk
So petrified Im so scared to step into this ride
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb
I wont forgive me if I give up trying
I heard his voice today
I didnt know a single word he said
Not one resemblance to the man I met
Just a vacant broken boy instead
I cant do it on my own
If this aint love then what is
Im willing to take the risk
I cant do it on my own
If this aint love then what is
I am willing to take the risk
Well try and give it up
Bursting at the seams no doubt
Well almost fall apart then burn the pieces
To watch them turn to dust
But nothing will ever taint us
I cant do it on my own
If this aint love then what is
Im willing to take the risk
I cant do it on my own
If this aint love then what is
I am willing to take the risk
Will he will he still remember me
Will he still love me even when hes free
Or will he go back to the place where he would choose the poison over me
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait
Ill be home so soon I wont be late
He cant do it on his own
If this aint love then what is
Hes willing to take the risk
He cant do it on his own
If this aint love then what is
Im willing to take the risk
He cant do it on his own
If this aint love then what is
Were willing to take the risk
I cant do it on my own
If this aint love then what is
Im willing to take the risk
Some say Ill be better without you

Hello can you hear me
Im in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
Ive forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
Theres such a difference between us
Hello from the other side
I mustve called a thousand times
To tell you Im sorry for everything that Ive done
But when I call you never seem to be home
At least I can say that Ive tried
To tell you Im sorry for breaking your heart
But it dont matter it clearly doesnt tear you apart
Its so typical of me to talk about myself Im sorry
I hope that youre well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened
Its no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side
I mustve called a thousand times
To tell you Im sorry for everything that Ive done
But when I call you never seem to be home
At least I can say that Ive tried
To tell you Im sorry for breaking your heart
But it dont matter it clearly doesnt tear you apart
Hello from the other side
I mustve called a thousand times
To tell you Im sorry for everything that Ive done
But when I call you never seem to be home
At least I can say that Ive tried
To tell you Im sorry for breaking your heart
But it dont matter it clearly doesnt tear you apart
In the same way as I did
The cracks in the pavement
I can do for you dear
Is there anyone I can call
No and thank you please Madam
I aint lost just wandering
Ooh the people Ive met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
I like it in the city
Is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody
I like it in the city
We aint gonna stand shit
That we aint gonna take it
That we aint gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Ooh the people Ive met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my worldLyrics submitted by Leandra
Cause I cant make you love me if you dont
You cant make your heart feel
And here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
And I will feel the power but you wont
Cause I cant make you love me
Cause then I wont see
The love you dont feel
When youre home with me
And Ill do whats right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight
And I will give up this fight
I thought I told you hed be home soon
Couldnt help myself youre too good to be true
I fall short each time
Every time he aint here
You and your charm creep closer
Like a fool for fire I fall with my pride and all
Like a bomb before explosion
Youre the wiser one disguised from greed
And Im just a child who belongs on her knees
But I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
Look how you want me now that I dont need you
So you thought that Id crumble to my knees
At the first sight of you crawling back to me
To whisper will you leave your man
Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me
I wont stand by you
Cause I found a boy who I love more
Than I ever did you before
So stand beside the river I cried
Look how you want me now that I dont need you
I aint yours for no taking
I could never look into your eyes and settle for wrong
When I found a boy who loves me more
Than you ever did me before
So stand beside the river you cried
Look how you want me now that I dont need you
I thought I told you hed be home soon
Couldnt help myself youre too good to be true
I fall short each time
Every time he aint here
You and your charm creep closer
Like a fool for fire I fall with my pride and all
Like a bomb before explosion
Youre the wiser one disguised from greed
And Im just a child who belongs on her knees

I could never look into your eyes and settle for wrong
When I found a boy who loves me more
Than you ever did me before
So stand beside the river you cried
Look how you want me now that I dont need you
I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your oceans too
Treat me soft but touch me cruel
I wanna teach you things you never knew ooh baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
And kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me
Baby dont let the lights go down
Baby dont let the lights go down
Baby dont let the lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight
Dont let go baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight
Dont let go baby give me light
I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do
Baby you bring your heart Ill bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone
Baby dont let the lights go down
Baby dont let the lights go down
Baby dont let the lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
Lights go down lights go down
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight
Dont let go baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight
Dont let go baby give me light
We play so dirty in the dark
Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight
Dont let go baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in hold me tight
Dont let go baby give me light
I miss you I miss you
I miss you I miss you

Hold me closer one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me for my sins
Yes I swam dirty waters
But you pushed me in
Ive seen your face under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart more than I do
We were the greatest me and you
But we had time against us
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and its blue
And I see my future in you
Ill be waiting for you when youre ready to love me again
Ill put my hands up
Ill be better to you
Ill be waiting for you when youre ready to love me again
Ill put my hands up
Ill be better to you
Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me
And pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then but now Im willing to learn
But we had time against us
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and its blue
And I see my future in you

Take your eyes off me so I can leave
Im far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending we have been here before
But I cant stay this time cause I dont love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Dont try to change my mind
Im being cruel to be kind
I cant love you in the dark
It feels like were oceans apart
There is so much space between us
You have given me something I cant live without
You mustnt underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I dont want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
I cant face your breaking heart
Im trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay
I cant love you in the dark
It feels like were oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Were not the only ones
I dont regret a thing
You know Ill always mean
It is the world to mean
That you are in my life
But I want to live
Thats why I cant love you in the dark
It feels like were oceans apart
There is so much space between us
IIIII dont think you can save me
Whenever Im alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever Im alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again
Whenever Im alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever Im alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again
However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you
Whenever Im alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever Im alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again
However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you
Whatever words I say I will always love you
I will always love you
However far away I will always love you

Whenever Im alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again
When the rain is flowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you havenât made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
Iâve known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind that you belong
Iâd go hungry Iâd go black and blue
Iâll go crawling down the avenue
So thereâs nothing that I wouldnât do
To make you feel my love
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway over there
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ainât seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldnât do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my loveLyrics submitted by Ilse
Right under my feet theres air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And Im forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
They melt my heart to stone
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head Im the only one in love
Im the only one in love
Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Youve burnt my heart to stone
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head Im the only one in love
Im the only one in love
Why do you steal my hand
Whenever Im standing my own ground
You build me up then leave me dead
I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head Im the only one in love
Im the only one in love
And I hear your words
Like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head
Im the only one in love
Im the only one in love
I turn around to leave
I try to link it
As you tear your way
I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
Deep down I must have always known
That is would be inevitable
To earn my stripes Id have to pay
I know Im not the only one
Who regrets the things theyve done
Sometimes I just feel its only me
Who can spend the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air I miss my friends
I miss my mother I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They cant look me in the eye
Its like theyre scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they dont recognize me now
In the light of day
I know Im not the only one
Who regrets the things theyve done
Sometimes I just feel its only me
Who never became who they thought theyd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air I miss my friends
I miss my mother I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
And I never give in
I agree with you on that
I think youre giving out
In way too much in fact
I say weve only known
You like to be so close
I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs
And you prefer the floor
I thought I knew myself
Somehow you know me more
I dont know who Id be
If I didnt know you
We would and we do

Scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone cause
I cant fight it anymore
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
Its a quarter after one
Im all alone and I need you now
but I lost all control and I need you now
And I dont know how I can do without
I just need you now
cant stop looking at the door
in the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
Its a quarter after one
And I need you now
but I lost all control and I need you now
And I dont know how I can do without
I just need you now
Yes Id rather hurt than feel nothing at all
Its a quarter after one
Im all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldnt call
but Im a little drunk and I need you now
And I dont know how I can do without
I just need you now
I just need you now
Oh baby I need you nowLyrics submitted by Meh ran
I know sometimes youre scared of the light
But how will you ever know if you never try
Theres something new inside my heart
And it cries like a child whenever were apart
Ive seen your face under every sky
I find the less I look more I find
So lets go back there back to the start
Swear Im never gonna leave you
Youre the only one I want
Lets go back there back to the start
You know Im never gonna leave you
Cause youre the only one I want
You know sometimes that Im scared of the dark
But Im feeling so brave when Im in your arms
You said my name in the dead of glory
When Im sure of falling
So lets go back there back to the start
Swear Im never gonna leave you
Cause youre the only one I want
Lets go back there back to the start
Swear Im never gonna leave you
Cause youre the only one I want
When well try and give it up
Bursting at the seams no doubt devil
Almost fall apart then burn to pieces
And well watch them turn to dust
But without each other nothing is seizing us
So lets go back there back to the start
Swear Im never gonna leave you
Cause youre the only one I want
Lets go back there back to the start
Swear Im never gonna leave you
Cause youre the only one I want yeah
No Im never gonna leave you no
You left hurts my heart
So bad it cuts through
The deepest parts of me
And fills up my mouth
With words that I cry
Of the ones wed made
But as time goes on
And my age gets older
I love the ones I know
Just your heal 4xLyrics submitted by Leandra

Youve been on my mind I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time just thinking of your face
God only knows why its taken me so long to let my doubts go
Youre the only one that I want
I dont know why Im scared Ive been here before
Every feeling every word Ive imagined it all
Youll never know if you never try
To forgive your past and simply be mine
I dare you to let me be your your one and only
Promise Im worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me a chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Have Ive been on your mind do you hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time at the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me whichever road I choose youll go
I dont know why Im scared cause Ive been here before
Every feeling every word Ive imagined it all
Youll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine
I dare you to let me be your your one and only
Promise Im worthy to hold in your arms
So come on and give me a chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
I know it aint easy giving up your heart
I know it aint easy giving up your heart
I know it aint easy giving up your heart
Trust me Ive learned it
I know it aint easy giving up your heart
Trust me Ive learned it
I know it aint easy giving up your heart
Trust me Ive learned it

Trust me Ive learned it
So I dare you to let me be your your one and only
I promise Im worthy to hold in your arms

To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Come on and give me a chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile

Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life
Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel
I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
So scratch my itch and beat my drum
So i can start to begin whats begun
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and its lighting me up
Scratch my itch and beat my drum

I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breath
Right before my eyes I saw my heart it came to life
This aint easy its not meant to be
Every story has its scars
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be I will be your remedy
No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whenever Ill be the shelter that wont let the rain come through
Your love it is my truth
And I will always love you
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be I will be your remedy
When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
I will be I will be
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be I will be I will be
Who wants to be right as rain
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you dos a game
And your all on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who want to be right as rain
Its harder when your on top
There aint no room in my bed
As far as Im concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We wont be making up
Ive cried my heart out
Ive had enough of love
Who wants to be riding high
You give up everything you are
And even then you dont get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
When your at your worst
You know how to feel things
There aint no room in my bed
As far as Im concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We wont be making up
Ive cried my heart out
Ive had enough of love
Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
When we were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
To be right as rain
And Im all on my own
I chose to be alone

Everybody tells me its bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley its so shallow and man made
Im scared to death if I let you in that youll see Im just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know thats just me cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water now that somethings in me
Oh I cant go back but the reeves are growing out of my fingertips
I cant go back to the river
But its in my roots in my veins
Its in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Oh Its in my roots in my veins
Its in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea
I should probably tell you now before its way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology I know its years in advance
But Id rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No I cant go back but the reeves are growing out of my fingertips
I cant go back to the river
But its in my roots in my veins
Its in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Oh Its in my roots in my veins
Its in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea
So I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea the River Lea the River Lea
Theres a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch its bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go head and sell me out and Ill lay your ship shit bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Dont underestimate the things that I will do
Theres a fire starting in my heart
And its bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
We could have had it all
Youre gonna wish you never had met me
Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
Youre gonna wish you never had met me
And you played it to the beat
Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
Baby I have no story to be told
But Ive heard one on you
And Im gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there
As mine sure wont be shared
Youre gonna wish you never had met me
The scars of your love remind me of us
Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
Youre gonna wish you never had met me
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep

Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
Youre gonna wish you never had met me
And you played it to the beat
Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
We could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating
Throw your soul through every open door woah
Count your blessings to find what you look for woah
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold woah
Youll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow woah
Youre gonna wish you never had met me
We could have had it all
Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep
We could have had it all
Youre gonna wish you never had met me
It all it all it all
Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep

She aint gonna be able to love you like I will
You and I have history
Sure shes got it all
But baby is that really what you want
Bless your soul youve got your head in the clouds
She made a fool out of you
And boy shes bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But youre cold to the core
Now rumour has it she aint got your love anymore
She is half your age
But Im guessing thats the reason that youve stayed
I heard youve been missing me
Youve been telling people things you shouldnt be
Like when we creep out and she aint around
Havent you heard the rumours
Bless your soul youve got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And boy Im bringing me down
You made my heart melt yet Im cold to the core
But rumour has it Im the one youre leaving her for
All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just cause I said it it dont mean that I meant it
Just cause I said it dont mean that I meant it
Just cause you heard it
But rumour has it hes the one Im leaving you forLyrics submitted by Nop
This was all none of it me
You put your hands all over my body and told me
You told me you were ready
For the big one for the big jump
I be your last love everlasting you and me
That was what you told me
You set me free oh
Send my love to your new lover
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we aint kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we aint kids no more
I was too strong you were trembling
You couldnt handle the hot heat rising rising
I was running you were walking
You couldnt keep up you were falling down down
Mmm theres only one way down
You set me free oh
Send my love to your new lover
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we aint kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we aint kids no more
If youre ready if youre ready
If youre ready I am ready
If youre ready if youre ready
We both know we aint kids no more
No we aint kids no more
You set me free oh
Send my love to your new lover
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we aint kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts

If youre ready if youre ready Send my love to your new lover
If youre ready are you ready Treat her better
Weve gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we aint kids no more
If youre ready if youre ready Send my love to your new lover
If youre ready are you ready Treat her better
Weve gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we aint kids no more
I let it fall my heart
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But theres a side to you
That I never knew never knew
All the things youd say
They were never true never true
And the games you play
You would always win always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name
When I lay with you
Cause theres a side to you
That I never knew never knew
All the things youd say
They were never true never true
And the games youd play
You would always win always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell something died
Cause I knew that that was the last time the last time
Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when were already over
I cant help myself from looking for you
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well it burned while I cried
Cause I heard it screaming out your name your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell something died
Cause I knew that that was the last time the last time ohhhh
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
So overdue I owe them
You may have my number
You can take my name
But youâll never have my heart
Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know Iâd never be me
Put your hand in my hand
At skyfall Lyrics submitted by Joanna Hill
I heard that your settled down
That you found a girl and your married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didnt give to you
Old friend why are you so shy
It aint like you to hold back or hide from the lie
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldnt stay away I couldnt fight it
I hoped youd see my face that youd be reminded
That for me it isnt over
Nevermind Ill find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Dont forget me I beg I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead yeah
Youd know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summery haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldnt stay away I couldnt fight it
I hoped youd see my face that youd be reminded
That for me it isnt over yet
Nevermind Ill find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Dont forget me I beg I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead yaye
Nothing compares no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes theyre memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste
Nevermind Ill find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Dont forget me I beg I remembered you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead
Nevermind Ill find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too

With your loving there aint nothing
The way Im running with you honey
Is we can break every low
I find it funny that youre the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls
I wasnt ready then Im ready now
Im heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life Ive been frozen
The sweetest devotion Ive known
Ill forever be whatever you want me to be
Ill go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if Im gonna lose my way home
Just remember that come whatever Ill be yours all alone
I wasnt ready then Im ready now
Im heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life Ive been frozen
The sweetest devotion Ive known
Ive been looking for you baby
In every face that Ive ever known
And there is something bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
All my life youre my darkness
Youre the right kind of madness
And youre my hope youre my despair
Youre my scope everything everywhere
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life Ive been frozen
The sweetest devotion Ive known
Didnt I give it all
Gave you everything I had
Didnt I do it right
Did I let you down
Maybe you got too used to
Still how can you walk away
Its gonna be an empty road
But go on and take it
Take it all with you
Nothing is better than this
And this is everything we need
Youve given up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this
But go on go on and take it
Take it all with you
I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home I will adjust
Oh if only if only you knew
Everything I do is for you
Go on and take it
Take it all with you
Take it all with you

You made me leave you
Cant have you the way

While you cut me down
It had only just begun
But now its over now
In the heat of moments
Fed up of biding your time
When i dont get nothing back
And for and for and for
When i dont get nothing back
I looked up and inside down
And outside only to find
A double taking punching hard
And laughing at my smile
Fed up of biding your time
When i dont get nothing back
And for and for and for
When i dont get nothing back
Boy im tired of trying
Fed up of biding your time
When i dont get nothing back
And for and for and for
When i dont get nothing back
Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what were fighting for
All that I say you always say more
I cant keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb I cant breathe
So I wont let you close enough to hurt me
No I wont ask you you to just desert me
I cant give you what you think you gave me
Its time to say goodbye to turning tables
Under haunted skies I see you oh
Where love is lost your ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try no I will never be knocked down
I cant keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb I cant breathe
So I wont let you close enough to hurt me no
I wont ask you you to just desert me
I cant give you what you think you gave me
Its time to say goodbye to turning tables
Next time Ill be braver
Ill be my own savior
When the thunder calls for me
Next time Ill be braver
Ill be my own savior
Standing on my own two feet
I wont let you close enough to hurt me no
I wont ask you you to just desert me
I cant give you what you think you gave me
Its time to say goodbye to turning tables
If youre not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees
If youre not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free
And if Im not the one for you
Youve gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey if Im not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through
Its so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently
Dont pretend that you dont want me
Our love aint water under the bridge
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently
Dont pretend that you dont want me
Our love aint water under the bridge
Say that our love aint water under the bridge
What are you waiting for
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from
It aint no life to live like youre on the run
Have I ever asked for much
The only thing that I want is your love
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently
Dont pretend that you dont want me
Our love aint water under the bridge
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently
Dont pretend that you dont want me
Our love aint water under the bridge
Say that our love aint water under the bridge
Its so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently
Dont pretend that you dont want me
Our love aint water under the bridge
If youre gonna let me down let me down gently
Dont pretend that you dont want me
Our love aint water under the bridge
Say it aint so say it aint so
Say it aint so say it aint so

Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
Cause you feel like home
Youre like a dream come true
But if by chance youre here alone
Can I have a moment
Cause Ive been by myself all night long
Hoping youre someone I used to know
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God this reminds me
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
We were sad of getting old
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
Cause nobody told me that youd be here
And I swore you moved overseas
Thats what you said when you left me
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God this reminds me
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
We were sad of getting old
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
Its hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasnt gone
I guess I still care
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God this reminds me
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
We were sad of getting old
Im so mad Im getting old
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face
From the deepest part of my regret
I hear the words I wish Id said
At the dawning of the day
I cant bare to see the light
I make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness youve left
I cant drown in your tears
I wont face your fears
I need to fight my own
Youll never see me again
Ill be back in time
Let the waves take me under
Youll never see me again
At the dawning of the day
I cant bare to see the light
I make up memories in my head
They help to fill the emptiness youve left
I cant drown in your tears
I wont face your fears
I need to fight my own
Youll never see me again
Ill be back in time
Let the waves take me under
Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you life goes on
Youll never see me again
Ive been learning to live without you now
Its taken all of my strength
Youll never see me again
Ill be back in time
Let the waves take me under
Let the floor beneath of me fall
Let the sky come crashing down
Turn all my right to wrong
But after you that goes on
Youll never see me again
Youll never see me again
Youll never see me again
