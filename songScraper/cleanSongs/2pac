Bumpin these walls as I pause addicted to the fast life

Guess its true what they tellin me
Fresh out of jail lifes Hell for a black celebrity

Straight in control flowsll fold while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set I told Dramacy go in next
Golddiggin cold diggin a gold Rolex

Runnin up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia

No matter where I go I see the same hoe
Every other city we go every other video

Black Cotton A symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tail
Ghetto gospel that is listen
Robbin Black Cotton in Gods eyes
Steady stressin Smith and Wessons count my blessins
Class is in session the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves sweatin blades to an early grave
Never got paid but still we slave In the nine tre
Answer that then answer this too
Loves gonna get ya you know its true lifes a bitch true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative
Whats the matter G Black cat got your tongue
Fat track gotcha sprung now your hung Do ya feel me
Dum dum diddy is it me
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace then at least lets get a piece
Im tired of seeing bodies on the streets deceased
Lookin through my highschool yearbook
Reminiscin of the tears as the years took
One homie two homie three homies POOF
We used to have troops but now theres no more youth to shoot
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton In Gods eyes
No matter how hard I tryLook to the skyand I ask God why
Seems like my dreamsDrowned in by screamsNo answer to my questions
Feels like Im pressedWhy do I stressIts like Im being tested
Seems like my prayersVanish to thin airPlease answer my questions
In the belly of the beast Im bubbling up
Running out of luck about to self destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
Your sure to catch her witcha one day boy
I wouldnt listen to em
Your power movement was cool
But it aint fix nothin
So I just go with what i know
Look what the 80s did
And now we grown up
Nobody aint own us yet
Black cotton Im plottin on what they owe me
Im workin without a profit
They shacklin all my homies
Im hurtin but keep the mind
And we aint stop its cutains you try to rise and
Certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridas
Whats the reward for a strugala
If the lord lovin us then why they hate to see us comin up
Runnin up Gun cocked like nasty gloves
If you aint got a penny mind the glove
Waitin for my 40 acas and a blunt to blaze
Biblicle times good hearts with milita minds
Black Cotton Im hoppin over enemy lines
Black Cotton I aint stoppin till they givin me mine
brendas got a baby
i hear brendas got a baby
but brendas barely got a brain
the girl can hardly spell her name
thats not our problem that up to brendas family
well let me show you how i affects tha whole community
now brenda really never her moms and her dad was a
went in debt to his arms its sad
cause i bet brenda doesnt even know
just cause your in tha ghetto doesnt mean you cant grow
but oh thats a thought my own revelation
do whatever ittakes ta resist the temptation
brenda got herself a boyfriend
her boyfriend was a cousin now lets watch the joy end
she tried to hide her pregnancy from her family
who really didnt care to see or give a damn if she
went out and had a church of kids
as long as when tha check came in the got first dibs
now brendas belly is gettin bigger
but no one seems to notice any change in her figure
shes 12 years old and shes having a baby
in love with tha molester whos sexin her crazy
and yet she thinks that hell be with her forever
and a dream of a world with the two of them together
he left her and she had the baby solo she had it on tha
and didnt know soshe didnt know what to throw away and
she wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heep
i guess she thought shed get away
how much the little baby had her eyes
now the babys in tha trash heep ballin
momma cant help himbut it hurts ta hear him calling
brenda wants to run away
momma say you makin me loose pay social workers here
now brendas gotta make her own way
cant go to her famliy they wont let her stay
no money no babysitter she couldnt keep a job
she tried ta sell crack but ended up getting robbed
so now whats next there aint nothing left to sell
so she sees sex as as a way of leavin hell
its paying the rent so she really cant complain
prostitute found slain and brendas her name shes got a baby
dont she know shes got
dont she know shes got
dont she know shes got a baby
dont she know shes got
dont she know shes got
dont she know shes got a baby
dont she know shes got

In the citaaay of LA
In the citaaay of good ol Watts
In the citaaay the city of Compton
We keep it rockin We keep it rockin
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild wild west
A state thats untouchable like Elliot Ness
The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with a bomb ass hemp beat
The state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean moneymakinmachines servin fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin sassoon
Now its 95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin lookin like I robbed Liberace
Its all good from Diego to tha Bay
Your city is tha bomb if your city makin pay
Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way
Dre puttin it down for
2Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it mama
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it shake it shake it
Out on bail fresh outta jail California dreamin
Soon as I stepped on the scene Im hearin hoochies screamin
Fiendin for money and alcohol
The life of a west side playa where cowards die and its all ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In LA we wearin Chucks not Ballies thats right
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossin but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous cause we program worldwide
Letem recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin and grindin like a slow jam its west side
So you know the row wont bow down to no man
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of LA
The Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down

Uh yeah uh longbeach in tha house uh yeah

I see no changes Wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living Should I blast myself
Im tired of bein poor and even worse Im black
My stomach hurts so Im lookin for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro Pull the trigger kill a nigga hes a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares One less hungry mouth on the welfare
First ship em dope let em deal to brothers
Give em guns step back and watch em kill each other
Its time to fight back thats what Huey said
2 shots in the dark now Hueys dead
I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
unless we share with each other We gotta start makin changes
Learn to see me as a brother stead of 2 distant strangers
And thats how its supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if hes close to me
Id love to go back to when we played as kids
but things changed and thats the way it is
Bridge w changing ad libs
Thats just the way it is
Thingsll never be the same
Thats just the way it is
I see no changes All I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races we under
I wonder what it takes to make this one better place
Take the evil out the people theyll be acting right
Cause both black and white are smokin crack tonight
And only time we chill is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven sent
we aint ready to see a black President uhh
It aint a secret dont conceal the fact
the penitentiarys packed and its filled with blacks
But some things will never change
Try to show another way but they stayin in the dope game
Now tell me whats a mother to do
Bein real dont appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
I made a G today But you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin crack to the kids I gotta get paid
Well hey well thats the way it is
We gotta make a change
Its time for us as a people to start makin some changes
Lets change the way we eat lets change the way we live
and lets change the way we treat each other
You see the old way wasnt working so its on us to do
what we gotta do to survive
And still I see no changes Cant a brother get a little peace
Theres war on the streets the war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty
they got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I aint never did a crime I aint have to do
But now Im back with the facts givin em back to you
Dont let em jack you up back you up crack you up and pimp smack you up
You gotta learn to hold ya own
They get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops they cant touch this
I dont trust this when they try to rush I bust this
Thats the sound of my tune You say it aint cool but mama didnt raise no fool
And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped I never get to lay back
Cause I always got to worry bout the pay backs
Some buck that I roughed up way back comin back after all these years
Ratatattattattat Thats the way it is uhh
Some things will never change Lyrics submitted by puru
Ha ha hafuck all yallfuck all yallI dont need nobody
I need a homie that know me
when all these muthafuckin cops be on me
I got problems aint nobody calling back
now what the fuck is happenin with my ballin cats
Remember me Im ya homie that was down to brawl
Sippin Hennessy hanging with the clowns and
all we used to do is drink brew screw and common knew
we had bitches by the dozens oh we fuckin cousins
You can throw ya middle finger if ya feel me loc
a nigga just got paid and we still was broke
It took time but finally the cash was mine
all the rewards of a hustler stuck in the grind
Look around and all I see is snakes and faces
like scavengers waitin to take a hustlers papes
and when you stuck where the fuck is all ya friends
They straight busted and cant be trusted fuck yall
Im sippin Tanqueray and juice and whats the use
cause Im a hopeless thug
Aint no love reminiscing on how close we was
way back in the day before they put the crack in the way
and heeyyy how much money can you stack in a day
Its gettin rough collect calls from my niggas in court
I recollect we used to ball now just livings enough
I stand tall in the winter summer spring or fall
Thug for life scrawled all across the wall
and all about my dollars make me wanna holla
drop an album sell a million give a fuck about tomorrow
I know its gettin crazy after dark
these marks keep on huffin and puffin
aint no fear in my heart
Whats going on in the ghetto still struggle and strive
I still roll with the heater smokin chocolate thai
In 94 Ill be going solo
too many problems with my own
I went from rags to riches quick
to socializing with the baddest bitches
went from a bucket to a rag with switches
Im seein death around the corner
Im bumpin Gloriaaaa doin 90 cause I wanna
Im getting high like I said it with some chocolate thai
mixed with some indonesia watch me fly
And even though I know the cops behind me
hit the weed and uh I continue doing 90 Biotch
will I get caught another ticket get to kick it in court
Fuck the law give a shit Im even worse than before
I know they wanna see a nigga buried
but I aint worried still throwing these thangs
got me locked in these chains
and hey nigga what the fuck is you wailin bout
soon as I hit the cell Ill be bailin out
And when I hit the streets Im in a rush to ball
Im screaming Thug Life nigga fuck yall
Repeat of introLyrics submitted by nancy
Aint that a bitch you devils are so two faced
Wanna see me lockd in chains
And gettin sockd by you crooked cops again
Fucking with the young black male tryna stack bail
And stay away from them pack jails
I told told the judge im in danger
And thats why I had that 45 with one in the chamber
Chrous Fuck the world they tryna say that I dont care
Woke up and screamed fuck the world they tryna say that I dont care
Just woke up and screamed fuck the world they tryna say that I dont care
I woke up and screamed fuck the world they tryna say that I dont care
Just got up and screamed fuck the world
When I was comin up rough that wasnt even what you call it
That why I smoke blunts now and run with alcoholics
Im gettin threats to me comin from my enemies
And in they dream its hell where they sending me
Have i lost control or just another soul
A car full of motherfuckers when we roll
Sipping on yack as I sit back
Life is as a big mack
Brothers come up and say you did that
Never take your eyes off the prize
Even if you getting high dont never hesiatate to try
Cause you can fall off or stay ballin
Niggas we all in and then my mother fucking callin
They wanna label me a menace
Because im sittin here sippin on genis
Weightin 165 and these tricks should die
For being jealouy of a brother when he rides
I can see it in your eyes
You wanna see a young playa fallin
They hate to see a nigga ballin
Some of you suckas is bustas
Plottin on what I got and you wonder why I shot em
Stop giving game for free
You wanna hang with me like being a thug is the thang to be
But I got love for my homies the Gs and macks
And if your black you betta stay straped
They wanna know if I claim the click that im hangin with
And if im down with this bangin shit
But homie I dont give a fuck if your blood or cuz
Long as you got love for thugs
But dont try and test me out
Stall that homie this is thug life
We then been to hell and back
And if I fell black its back to the corners where we sell crack
Some of you niggas are bustas
You runnin round with them tramp ass bitches
But dont cry the world aint prepared fo us
A straight thug motherfucker that aint scared to bust
I dont careLyrics submitted by Regina
Hit them with a lil ghetto gospel
Those who wish to follow me My ghetto gospel
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns
If I could recollect before my hood days
Id sit and reminisce think of the bliss on the good days
I stop and stare at the younger my heart goes to em
They tested it was stressed that they under
Everyones ashamed to the youth cause the truth looks strange
And for me its reversed we left them a world thats cursed and it hurts
cause any day theyll push the button
and all good men like Malcolm X and Bobby Hunton died for nothing
Dont them let me get teary the world looks dreary
but when you wipe your eyes see it clearly
theres no need for you to fear me
if you take your time to hear me maybe you can learn to cheer me
it aint about black or white cause were human
I hope we see the light before its ruined
Tell me do you see that old lady aint it sad
Living out a bag but shes glad for the little things she has
And over there theres a lady crack got her crazy
Guess shes given birth to a baby
I dont trip and let it fade me from outta the frying pan
We jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals take control drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from everyone
And when its said and done
I bet this Brotha be a better one
If Im upset you dont stress
Never forget that God hasnt finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy
Cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war on the streets
Lord can you hear me speak
To pay the price of being hell boundLyrics submitted by A
Makaveli in this Killuminati all through your body
The blows like a twelve gauge shotty
And God said he should send his one begotten son
to lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me eat my flesh flesh and my flesh
Come with me Hail Mary
Run quick see what do we have here
Now do you wanna ride or die
La dadada la la la la
I aint a killer but dont push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to getting pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded wise words being quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down pray to God hoping that hes listening
Seeing niggas coming for me to my diamonds when they glistening
Now pay attention rest in peace father
Im a ghost in these killing fields
Hail Mary catch me if I go lets go deep inside
the solitary mind of a madman who screams in the dark
Evil lurks enemies see me flee
Activate my hate let it break to the flame
Set trip empty out my clip never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupted fucked in this shit
Stuck niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit plus
mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they cant adjust
Its just as well Hail Mary
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers
Never realize the precious time the bitch niggas is wasting
Institutionalized I lived my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile were too crazy to be humble we balling
Catch me father please cause Im falling in the liquor store
Thats the Hennessee I hear ya calling can I get some more
Hail til I reach Hell I aint scared
Mama checking in my bedroom I aint there
I got a head with no screws in it what can I do
One life to live but I got nothing to lose just me and you
on a one way trip to prison selling drugs
We all wrapped up in this living life as Thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doing they bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights Ill be down in the dark
Thuggin eternal through my heart now Hail Mary nigga
They got a APB out on my Thug family
Since the Outlawz run these streets like these skanless freaks
Our enemies die now walk around half dead
Head down K blasted off Hennessee and Thai
Trying it mixed it now Im twisted blisted and high
Visions of me Thug living getting me by
Forever live and I multiply survived by Thugs
When I die they wont cry unless they coming with slugs
Peep the whole scene and whatevers going on around me
Brain kinda cloudy smoked out feeling rowdy
Ready to wet the party up and whoever in that motherfucker
Nasty new street slugger my heat seeks suckers
on the regular mashing in a stolen black Ac Integra
Cock back sixty seconds til the draw thats when Im dead in ya
Feet first you got a nice gat but my heats worse
From a Thug to preaching church I gave you love now you eating dirt
Needing work and I aint the nigga to put you on
Cause word is bond when I was broke I had to hustle til dawn
Thats when sun came up theres only one way up
hold ya head and stay up to all my niggas get ya pay and weight up
If its on then its on we break beatbreaks
Outlawz on a paper chase can you relate
to this shit I dont got be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate hoping God dont close the gate
If its on then its on we break beatbreaks
Outlawz on a paper chase can you relate
to this shit I dont got be the shit I gotta take
Dealing with fate hoping God dont close the gate
Weve been traveling on this wayward road
Long time til I be take a eavy load
But we ride ride it like a bullet
We wont worry everything will come real
Free like the bird in the tree
We wont worry everything will come real
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We running from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty

Heaven aint hard to findHeaven
All you gotta do is look
Simply because you nervous let me start off with my conversation
Hoping my information eleviates the hesitation
I can see it clearly now
catch you smiling through your frown
Im askin Baby Boo are you down
Although I know youve heard about my reputation
My temptation got me dripping wet
Im activated by the moves your making
Baby why you faking strip naked get the love making
See its all in your mind so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize till that ass is mine
Never gettin but wanting never touching but wishing
A straight thug on a mission until I get what Im missing
Stop with the beeper baby Listen
I know youre grown but pay attention
Let me hypnotize with my tongue kissin
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes
Turn around one more time
Heaven aint hard to find
Heaven aint hard to find
Heaven aint hard to find
Heaven aint hard to find
In fact you can have it just have faith
Just like a little kid still believing in magic
It takes a lot of sacrifice
with all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes
baby youre moving to fast
My conversations are getting deeper but first let me ask
Are you afraid of a thug
and have you ever made love
with candles and bubbles sipping in your tub
Touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistening beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that alazhay
come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends
Ill be the thug in your life
baby and youll be my soulja
And I know it takes some time
And you got a lot of questions on your mind
But relax in due time
Heaven Aint Hard to Find
Heaven aint hard to find2Pac
It Aint hard to findDanny Boy
You think we all dogs thats why you cautious when I approached you
Been talking since you arrived but not a word is spoken
Through my eye contact I wink and you respond back

I got a flight out Chicago lets kick it this weekend
Im sipping Heneesee and coke

Oh god help me identify me truest thoughts
your hidden motives full of passion who would of thought
Come hollar at me baby love me for my thug nature
Far from a playa hater label me a money maker

Puffy weaker than a fuckin block
And Im smoking Junior Mafia

While you fucking with me
Im a self made Millionaire
Thug livin out of prison
Pistols in the Air Air Ha Ha

With my clique looting shooting and polluting your block
Cocked glock to your knot
Outlaw Mafia clique moving up another notch
And your Pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
And all your fake ass east coast props
Ill tell you to your face you aint shit but a faker

We Bad Boy killers Lyrics submitted by Nashvel Adams
Little somethin for my godson Elijah and a little girl named Corinne
Some say the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares if dont nobody else care
And uhh I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothas clown a lot
But please dont cry dry your eyes never let up
Forgive but dont forget girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you aint nothin dont believe him
And if he cant learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you dont need him
And I aint tryin to gash up I just call em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy
When brothas make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women do we hate our women
I think its time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women be real to our women
And if we dont well have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies
And since a man cant make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know youre fed up ladies but you gotta keep your head up
Keep ya head up oooo child things are gonna get easier
Ooooo child things are gonna get brighter 2x
Aiyyo I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing ta me
He had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didnt seem so tough
And though we had it rough we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how Id rock the mic and make it to tha bright screen
Im tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Its hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems Im headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends but theyre blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
Its gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rainll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin wet up
You know its funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars but cant feed the poor
Say there aint no hope for the youth and the truth is
It aint no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby
We aint meant to survive cause its a setup
And even if youre fed up
Huh ya got to keep your head up
Keep ya head up oooo child things are gonna get easier
Ooooo child things are gonna get brighter 2x
To all the ladies havin babies on they own
I know its kinda rough and youre feelin all alone
Daddys long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it in fact Im sure
And if you fall stand tall and comeback for more
Cause aint nuttin worse than when your son
Wants to kno why his daddy dont love him no mo
You cant complain you was dealt this
Hell of a hand without a man feelin helpless
Because theres too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside but outside youre looking fearless
While tears is rollin down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things dont all down this week
Cause if it did you couldnt take it and dont blame me
I was given this world I didnt make it
And now my sons getten older and older and cold
From havin the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin Benz
Im still tryin to hold on to survivin friends
And its crazy it seems itll never let up but
Please you got to keep your head upLyrics submitted by nicole
Let it be prophesized niazll die because ya crews goon
Around the way niaz get murdered by the full moon
Heard it in whispered tones
niaz is bold and they choose to roll
I kill em all watch now nia truth be told
Westside was the war cry look how they scatter
niaz dyin by my 30yard brainsll splatter
Wonder why these niaz cross me
Im certified crazy so sick the world made me
Now diggydie everytime I ride its for reasons
Hard to kill a nia cause Im comin back like Jesus
Bow down to my ill nation runnin from drug cases
Lookin at my congregation so full of thug faces
Momma gave a nia breath a life of stress
I invest in a vest and makin niaz watch they every step
and I aint even got started with this st yet
Thug style baby hands on my pistol listen Im a ridah
Every nia breathin pay attention
Bout to show you motherfkers how it feel to drop a body

After the fire comes the rain after pleasure theres pain
Even though we broke for the moment well be ballin again
Til I make it yo my military be prepared for them bustaz
Similar to bihes that scary get too near me we rushin
Visions of overpacked prisons fiends and niaz thug livin
Pressures and three strikes I hope they dont test us
They pull the heater ammunition it cranks psssh
Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
They got me fiendin for currency the money be callin
Its like Im dreamin see in season me ballin
Cock the cocked fofive snatchin niaz pagers
Labeled a mark soon as we start it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin 40s moved to harder st
God damn now Im a grown man I follow no man
nia got my own plan and its called Killuminati
I spend most of my time bankin niaz
because they hate a nia comin across fake niaz
But we made niaz old school and Im thinkin
Yall some bih made niaz and you steadily sinkin
OUT LAWZ aint nuttin fkin with that
We bustin back comin back for the stacks
Laugh last cash cash all I want is the paper
Givin them fkers tool whips I rule haters
Yall cant fade us we kill steal and peal quickly
The boss niaz definitely put it down strictly
EDI Amin until the law come for me
Kill em all for shortie ninetynine Killuminati
They got me thinkin strugglin and hustlings my only fate
Toppin grams on the kichen plate tryin to keep that money straight
Times is rollin three up these streets sleep
But when I crack hammer cocked back rapped in my sheets
My lifes been crossed crooked since a seed it hurts
Got a package from the devil payin my deeds
Preocuppied by the greed in this crooked life I lead
More funds to spend or bigger guns to squeeze
Me and my thugs clock Gs simpin naughty thangs
Real as these tatts on my body and its Killuminati

How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told ya that I never thought of death
My nigga we the last ones left
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told ya that I never thought of death
My nigga we the last ones left
As I bail through the empty halls
Breath stinkin in my jaws
Ring ring ring quiet yall incoming call
Plus this my homie from high school he gettin by
Its time to bury another brother nobody cry
Life as a baller alcohol and booty calls
We used to do them as adolescents do you recall
Raised as Gs loced out and blazed the weed
Get on the roof lets get smoked out and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high assed out
Screamin thug till I die before I passed out
But now that you’re gone Im in the zone
Thinkin I dont wanna die all alone
And all I got left are stinkin memories
I love them niggas to death Im drinkin Hennessy
While tryin to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told ya that I never thought of death
My nigga we the last ones left
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told ya that I never thought of death
My nigga we the last ones left
Yeah nigga I got the word as hell
Ya blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time wont see parole
Imagine life as a convict thats gettin old
Plus with the drama were lookin out for your babys mama
Takin risks while keepin cheap tricks from gettin on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin on dumb hotties at chill parties
Me and you no true a two
While scheming on hits and gettin tricks
That maybe we can slide into
Rest nigga cause I aint worried
Eyes blurried sayin goodbye at the cemetery
I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball till my dyin days
Kato and Mental rest in peace
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told ya that I never thought of death
My nigga we the last ones left
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told ya that I never thought of death
My nigga we the last ones left
Bury me smilin with Gs in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
Kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and pen
So I can write about my life of sin
A coupla bottles of gin incase I dont get in
Tell all my people Im a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die
We outlaws let me ride
I live my life in the fast lane got police chasin me
To my niggas from old blocks from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor have a toast for the homies
See we both gotta die but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you’re gone
You left your nigga on his own how long we moan
How many brothers fell victim to the streets
Rest in peace young nigga theres a Heaven for a G
Be a lie if I told ya that I never thought of death
My nigga we the last ones left
Gone on cause they passed away
Niggas doin 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel ya nigga trust me I feel ya
You know what I mean
We poured out liquor for you
This year nigga life goes on
Get money evade bitches evade tricks
And basicaly just represent for you baby
Next time you see your niggas

Screamin Outlaw Wessyde motherfucker bustin on my enemys block
Educated on these cold streets

A bunch of adolescent niggaz spittin major shit
Tell me young nigga if ya die let me know
Would your heart feel pain watchin as your mother cries
Will all your homies ride
Or will they all get high and talk about how you died
Young niggaz on a mission to compete
Gettin Gs packin heat bringin havoc to the fuckin streets
Nobody knows why he took a fofo
and loaded up on the whole front row BUCK BUCK BUCK BUCK
Try to tell him but he act like he dont know me
Pull out his pistol and show me my lil homie
You motherfuckers know what time it is
Under eighteen better protect that shit
First to bomb sixteen on death row
Bustin on them phony motherfuckers cause the big homey said so
Niggaz knew I was a nut case quick to blast
Livin underage but hell blaze on yo bitch ass
Is there a heaven for a G
And if it is will I finally get to be at peace
On these streets aint no peace shellshocked souls
makin money off of crack sales young black males
Unable to change cause its a cycle
Plus nobody knows the evil that they might do
Lil Moo Big Yak K Kastro
