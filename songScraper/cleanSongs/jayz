You ready B Lets go get em
Look for me Young B
Cruisin down the westside high way
Doing what we like to do our way
Eyes behind shades this necklace the reason
all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl wit me
Im mashin the gas shes grabbin the wheel its true to the heart
She rides with me the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we dont speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the show is over
Shes right back to being my soldier
Cuz mamis a rider and Im a roller
Put us together how they gon stop both us
What ever she lacks Im right over her shoulder
When Im off track mami is keepin me focused
So lets lock this down like its supposed to be
The 03 Bonnie and Clyde Hov and B
Jay All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Bey Down to ride til the very end its me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend
Jay All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend
Bey Down to ride til the very end its me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend
The problem is you dudes treat the one that you lovin
with the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin
Now they bout nothin if ever you mad about somethin
It wont be that oh no it wont be that
I dont be at places where we comfy at
With no beatch oh no you wont see that
And no I aint perfect nobody walkin this earths surface is
But girlfriend work with the kid
I keep you workin at Hermes Burking Bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs aviator lens
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I dont have to worry only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
so dont let the necessary occur yep
If I was your girlfried
Ill be there for you if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me that somebody was me
Yeahhee break it down for em B
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise Ill give my life
and all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in all that I believe in
I promise Ill give my life
and all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
If you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one
I got the Rap Patrol ont the gat patrol
foes that wanna make sure my caskets closed
Rap critics say hes MoneyCashHoes
Im from the hood stupid what type of facts are those
If grew up with holes in your zapper toes
you celebrate the minute you was havin dough
im like fuck critics you can kiss my asshole
If you dont like my lyrics you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if i dont play they show
They dont play my hits well i dont give a shit so
Rap mags tryna use my black ass
So advertisers can dive em more cash for ads fuckers
I dont know what you take me as
Or understand he intelligence that Jay Z has
Im from rags to riches niggaz I aint dumb
I got 99 porblems but a bitch aint one hit me
99 problems but a bitch ain one
If you havin girl problems i feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one
The year is 94 and in my trunk is raw
And in my rear view mirror is the muthafuckin law
I got two chioces yall pull over the car or
Bounce on the Devil put thw pedal to the floor
I aint tryan see no highway chase with Jake
Plus i got a few dollars i can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road I heard
Son do you know why im stopping you for
Cuz im young and im black and my hats real low
Do I look like a mind reader sir I dont know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more
Well you was doin fiftyfive in a fiftyfour
License and registration step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you I know alot of you are
I aint steppin out of shit all my papers legit
well do ou mind if I look around the car a lil bit
Well the glove department is lockesd and so is the trunck and the back
And I know my right so you gon need a warrent for that
Arent you as sharp as a tack
What are you A lawyer or something or somebody important
Naw I aint pass the bar but I know a lil bit
Enough that you wont illegaly search my shit
Well well see how smart are when the canine comes
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one hit me
99 problems but a bitch ain one
If you havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one hit me
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong arm a hoe
This is not a hoe with a sense of having a pussy
But a pussy havin no goddamn sense Try and push me
I try and ignore em talk to the Lord
Pray for em but some fools just love to perform
You know the type loud as a motorbike
But wouldnt bust a grape in a fruit fight
The onlt thing thats gon happen is ima get to clappin and
He and his boys gon be yappin to the captain
There I go trapped in the KitKat again
Back through the system with the rif raf again
Feinds on the floor scratchin again
Papparazi with thay cameras snappin them
DA tried to gice an nigga shaft again
Half a mil fo rbail cuz Im African
All because a fool was harassing him
Tryna play ya boy hike he saccharin
But aint nuthin sweet how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems but being a bitch aint one hit me
99 problems but a bitch aint one
If you havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one hit me
99 problems but a bitch aint one
If you havin girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch aint one hit me

Now run along witcha little ass hits
Read my rap sheet nigga THREE CLASSICS
Shut ya bumba got ARod numbers
All you muddaskunks get buried in the trunk
When I blast the pump I leave you relaxed
In the hospital lookin at MASH for months

And the fleece got free and peepee on the steps
No law or governin why you fuckin wit him
Mattafact why you fuckin wit them
All yall need is the ROC baby

Dreamed of you this morning
Then came the dawn and I thought you were here with me
If you could only see
How much i love you
Thats all thats all thats all baby
Oh no Ill never give up on you
I never felt that before
This is the shit you dream about with the homie steamin out
Seems as our plans to get a grant
Then go off to college didnt pan or even out
We need it now we need a town
We need a place to pitch we need a mound
For now Im just a lazy boy
Big dreaming in my LaZBoy
In the clouds of smoke been playin this Marvin
Mama forgive me should be thinkin bout Harvard
But thats too far away niggas are starving
Aint nothin wrong with aim just gotta change the target
I got dreams of baggin sniddow the size of pillows
I see pies everytime my eyes cliddose
I see rides sixes i gotta get those
Lifes a bitch I hope not to make her a widow
Oh no Ill never give up on you
I never felt that before
Oh no Ill never give up on you
I never felt that before
Oh no Ill never give up on you
I never felt that before
Now see the lifes right there
And it seems right there
And its not like were professionals movin the decimals
Know where to cop Nah got a connect No
Who under Heaven know how to be successful
Need a Personal Jesus Im in Depeche Mode
They say its celestial its all in the stars
On how you play your cards
You all aint fucking with me
And at all costs better before he was bars
Now lets start on your mark
Get set lets goget out the car
Going in circles its a vicious cycle
This is a crash course this aint high school
Wake up Muttley youre dreamin again
Your own reality show the season begins
Step One in this process scramble up in your projects
And head to the heights where big coke is processed
You gotta convince em that you not from the Precinct
Please speak slow cause he no speakey no English
If he takes a liking after a couple of trips
If your money is straight hes gonna give you consignment
Youre now in a game where only time can tell
Survive the droughts i wish you well
Survive the droughts I wish you well
How sick am i I wish you HEALTH
I wish you wheels i wish you wealth
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself
You could see the signs when the jackets is schemin
And the cops is comin you could read they mind
You could see from behind you could redefine
The game as we know it one dream at a time
Dreamed of you this morning
Then came the dawn and I thought you were here with me

Got the whole world on lock down you know how we flow
Dont worry about Brooklyn I continue to flame
Therefore a world with amnesia wont forget your name
You held it down long enough let me take those reigns
And just like your spirit the commision remains
Niggaz can cross the Ts and dots the Is
Now that I got too popular to cop them pies
Im takin this rap shit serious to my demise
Jay shits like cake mix watch me rise
Basics in the basement waste it
Asking my dog for advice so when he cant say shit
my hatred is fueled just give me a sign
And I let the world know that the city is mine what
You belong to the city The city is mine whatwhatwhat
You belong to the night Gegegeyeah uhuhhuh papau
In the river of darkness
Hes a man of the night The city is mine thats right
Yall want to know how I flow just seek and you find
Im like a brain in the voicebox I speak my mind
About to redefine rap mami either Im
the illest nigga doing it or these niggaz is losin it
I read a article that said I was ruinin shit
But every time I look Im movin units in quick
So Ima hit yall with these last two and split
and leave niggaz with nothing but my influenceses
Soon its the Jigga I aint mad yeah bite my shit
Sell half of what I sell because its not quite my shit
Im the type to buy a Roley and just ice my shit
on the spot fuck comin back twice to shit
How real is that My floss game still intact
Boss game you lame dudes cant feel that
Like the first dude to cop the 850 and 89
and drove it up to 55th the city is mine what
You belong to the city The city is mine
You belong to the night Yeah uhh the city is mine
In the river of darkness Papa feel me
Hes a man of the night Yeah yeah bounce bounce
I snatch your girl cause your arm aint strong enough
Plus ya dont stay in the studio long enough
I make hits while yall stay hatin and take bricks
Had it locked til I came in the club Take 6
Got your chick cause you swore she was innocent
Got her a Chinese manicure hair done by Dominicans all for what
So I could be in a dark corner all in the butt
at the bar alchoholing her up
I represent the lifestyle of those who thirst cream
A buck fifty a shot Louis the Thirteenth
JayZ RocAFella yo know the name
I aint a player get it right Im controllin the game
From now until they blow holes in my frame
Ima stand firm holdin my aim feel me
Im the focal point like Biggie in his prime
on the low though shhhhh the city is mine

Youre now tuned into the motherfucking greatest
Turn the music up in the headphones
Tim you can go and brush your shoulder off nigga
If you feeling like a pimp nigga go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy baby dont forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder
I probably owe it to you all proud to be locked by the force
Trying to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feeling no remorse feeling like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law nigga griping my balls
All the ladies they love me from the bleachers they screaming
All the ballers is bouncing they like the way I be leaning
All the rappers be hating off the track that Im making
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom the bottom to the Top of the Pops
Nigga London Japan and Im straight off the block
Like a running back get it man Im straight off the block
I can run it back nigga cause Im straight with the Rock
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
Your homey Hov in position in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch trying to get me a Rover
Trying to stretch out the coca like a wrestler yes sir
Keep the Heckler close you know them smokersll test you
But like fiftytwo cards when Im Im through dealing
Now fiftytwo bars come out now you feel em
Now fiftytwo cars roll out remove ceiling
In case fiftytwo broads come out now you chilling
with a boss bitch of course SC on the sleeve
At the 4040 club ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels Im a grownup for real
Your boy back in the building Brooklyn we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bitch in the back of that Bach
Im the realest that run it I just happen to rap
I aint gotta clap at em niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album then I back out it
As the best rapper alive nigga ask about me
From Bricks to Billboards from grams to Grammies
The Os to opposite Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay for selling out the Garden in a day
Im like a young Marvin in his hey
Im a hustler homey you a customer crony
Got some dirt on my shoulder could you brush it off for me

From standin on the corners boppin
to drivin some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
For droppin some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot with the smoke Glock
fleein the murder scene you know me well
from nightmares of a lonely cell my only hell
But since when yall niggaz know me to fail Fuck naw
Where all my niggaz with the rubber grips bust shots
And if you with me mom I rub on your tits and whatnot
Im from the school of the hard knocks we must not
let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
lets stick up the world and split it fiftyfifty uhhuh
Lets take the dough and stay real jiggy uhhuh
And sip the Cris and get pissypissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie baby
You know its hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter

Its the hard knock life for us
Steada treated we get tricked
Steada kisses we get kicked

I flow for those droed out all my niggaz

We live in hard knocks we dont take over we borrow blocks
Burn em down and you can have it back daddy Id rather that
I flow for chicks wishin they aint have to strip to pay tuition
I see you vision mama I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers thats born to clock
Now Ima be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot sleepin on futons and cots
to King Size dream machines the green fives
Ive seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze lifes ills
Then I put it down type braile
Im tight grill with the phony rappers yall might feel we homies
Im like still yall dont know me shit
Im tight grill when my situation aint improvin
Im tryin to murder everything movin feel me
Its the hard knock life for us
Its the hard knock life for us
Steada treated we get tricked
Steada kisses we get kicked
Its the hard knock life for us
Its the hard knock life for us
Steada treated we get tricked
Steada kisses we get kicked
Its the hard knock life
I dont how to sleep I gotta eat stay on my toes
Gotta a lot of beef so logically I prey on my foes
Hustlings still inside of me and as far as progress
youd be hardpressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint and yall lamed out
Didnt really appreciate it til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out Xed your name out
Put Jigga on top and drop albums nonstop for ya nigguh
Its the hard knock life for us

Steada treated we get tricked

You take the clothes off my back
You steal the food right out my mouth
And I watch you eat it
I still don’t know why
Why I love you so much
In spite to put me to shame
Air all my laundry in the streets
Give it up for fame
But I still dont know why
Why I love it so much
And Its amazing Im in this maze with you
I just cant crack ya code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day youre so cold
Blue told me to remind you niggas
Fuck that shit y’all talking about
Caught up in all these lights and cameras
But look what that shit did to Hammer
Goddammit it I like it
The bright lights is enticing
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
30 mill for one fight
But soon as all the money blows
All the pigeons take flight
I cant even blame her for that
Enough to make me want to murder
Momma please just get my bail
I did it to myself
Its amazing Im in this maze with you
I just cant crack ya code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day youre so cold
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper
Cant even take my daughter for a walk
See em by the corner store
I feel like Im cornered off
Who the fuck Im kidding though
Curtains all in my window
You asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
It this shit aint work
Camera snapping my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your IRIS and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas
Take the good with the bad
Dont throw that baby out with the bath water
You still getting bigger nigga
And Its amazing Im in this maze with you
I just cant crack ya code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day youre so cold
If you are inbetween my words
Cos Im a hyphen hater
You are silent when I speak
But I can see you on paper
You are higher than an underscore
To me youre as dead as Latin
I cant even hear you when I am chattin
So why did you have to get involved
Like some big man dat
Was there something wrong with my grammar
Well now it doesnt matter
My name is four letters
Split by the button which is fatter
You are only good for pause
But when I got my flow
No one will stop me
Until I bring the applause
My alphabet goes from Jay to Zee
You are not a proper letter
So that that is why I have decided
That a space is much better
This should not be a surprise to you
Your kind of character was up for being dismissed
So now that you are free
Go catch some vibes with brother asterisk
Forward slash back slash hash tag comma
Only the alphabet will do
Im keepin it simple with syllable two
After zero is where you belong
At the end of all those numbers is where you are strong
Plus and equals sitting next door
All is not lost you have set a legacy
On websites tickets records and CD
This is not the end
You were more than a connector you were my friend
There is a new journey on the horizon
Go and enjoy life by saying Hi Fun
Just the sound of his voice is a hit
Yall niggas got me really confused out there
I make Big Pimpin or Give It 2 Me one of those
Yall hail me as the greatest writer of the 21st Century
I make some thoughtprovoking shit
Yall question whether he falling off
Ima really confuse yall on this one
When them tops come down chicks tops come down
Like when them shots come out make cops come around
When the blocks come out I can wake up a small town
Finish off the block then I make my mall rounds
When them stares get exchanged then the 5th come out
The tough guy disappears then the bitch come out
Thats him Im usually what they whisper about
Either what chick he with or his chip amount
Cause I been doing this since CHIPS was out
Watchin Erik Estrada baggin up at the Ramada
Table full of powder AC Broke
Bout to take another shower on my 25th hour
Spike Lees everywhere game or the flight
You might see me anywhere day in the life
Only thing changed the tail number on the flight
I can touch down and take off the same night
Bitch get off me
Trick get off me
You cant get shit off me
Dont even talk to me
This is that ignorant shit you like
Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick plus ice
Cmon I got that ignorant shit you love
Nigga fuck shit maricon puta and drugs
Cmon I got that ignorant shit you need
Nigga fuck shit ass bitch trick plus weed
Im only trying to give you what you want
Nigga fuck shit ass bitch you like it dont front
Looking at themselves in the mirror backwards
Cant even face themselves dont fear no rappers
Theyre all weirdos DeNiros in Practice
So dont believe everything your earlobe captures
Unless it happens to be as accurate as me
And everything said in song you happen to see
Then actually believe half of what you see
None of what you hear even if its spat by me
And with that said I will kill niggas dead
Cut niggas short give you wheels for legs
Im a KI double LER
See yall in hell
Shoot niggas straight through the ER
Whoa this aint BR no
Its SC CEO the next Lyor
No the next leader of the whole free world
And the first thing ima do is free Sigel GO
Take off the cuffs unlock the gate
Its that ignorant nigga that you love to hate
The 07 Ice Cube B Sig so rude
Tell a trick get these nuts eat dick like food
Now see if I care if this verse get aired
Even if you mute it the curse is there yeah
Im so raunchy bitch get off me
Keep my flea collar on you lil ticks get off me
I missed the part where it stopped being about Imus
What do my lyrics got to do with this SHIT
SCARFACE the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
Still that aint the blame for all the shit thats happened to me
Are you saying what Im spitting
Is worse than these celebutantes showin they kitten you kidding
Lets stop the bullshittin
Til we all without sin lets quit the pulpiting
SCARFACE the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
Still that aint the blame for all the shit thats happened to me
