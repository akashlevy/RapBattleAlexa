Just kick a little something for them cars that be bumpin
But we need a beat that they can front to
You know what Im sayin
Cars ride by with the boomin systems
For all the cars out there
That like to front in their rides
You know its funky funky funky cos you heard it from hearsay
A jam that you love that dont be gettin no airplay
Strictly for frontin when youre ridin around
12 oclock at night with your windows down
Headlights breakin cos your batteries drain
Armor all on your tires and a big gold chain
Parkin outside of all the hiphop spots
Push the EQ and play connect the dots
Leanin to the side people everywhere
The trunk full of amps there aint no room for a spare
Big beats bumpin with the bass in back
All the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack
Cos they dont understand why I act this way
Pumpin up the funky beat until the break of day
Its because I want attention when im ridin by
And the girls be on my jock cos my systems fly
Girlies wanna ride with a brother like me
Cos they be hear me gettin funky frequently
They tell me dont drink and drive I say what is this
Laid back hypnotized by the funky sound
People in the street see me bobbin my head
While Im checkin out the rapper and the rhyme that he said
Im frontin and I dont care if you know
The backseat of my car is like a disco show
You would think I was a good friend of Al Capone
Crazy air freshener who needs cologne
Bottom to the bottom to the top to the top
Cruise its 3 oclock
The girlies they smile they see me comin
Im steady hummin I got the Funky Drummer drummin
My trunk be shakin vibratin and rattlin
Pumpin so loud all the shorties be battlin
A righthand mans here without the swing
Every chance I get Im showin off my rings
I can keep it up until the break of dawn
Cos Im frontin in my ride and my word is bond
Sun roof open so I can feel the wind blow
I dont give a damn if it cracks my back window
C to the o to the o to the l to the i to the n
To the f to the r to the o to the n to the t to the i to the n
Like Spoonie Gee said my seats are soft like a bed
They recline way back so I can get real cosy
I got the gangster tapes in the place
Like a basehead would say I want bass
I want a hit I want a dose
Youre rollin up smilin but you cant come close
Cos my system is pumpin loud
Like Rakim said I wanna move the crowd
I warm it up with Kane fight the power with PE
Tell the cops you gots to chill with EPMD
This is something devastatin thatll break your trunk
And remember Uncle L is like the future of the funk
You know what im sayin
So next time youre in your ride pumpin it up

Mmmm yeah mmmmm check it out baby
Make it hot then we drop it
oooooooh Uptown you know how we do it
Its the first time together and Im feeling kinda horny
Conventional methods of makin love kinda bore me
I wanna knock your block off get my rocks off
Blow your socks off make sure your G spots soft
Im gonna call you Big Daddy and scream your name
Matter fact I cant wait for your candy rain
So what cha sayin I get my swerve on bring it live
Make it last forever damn the kitty cats tight
Mmm daddy slow down your flow
Put it on me like G baby nice and slow
I need a rough neck nigga Mandingo in a sec
Who aint afraid to pull my hair and spank me from the back
No doubt Im the playa that youre talkin about
But do you really think that you can work it out
I guarantee shorty its real baby stick it out
Here comes the man of steel
Chorus LeShaun LL Cool J
LeShaun Doin it and doin it and doin it well 3X
LL Cool J I respresent Queens she was raised out in Brooklyn

To hit now get down
Damn my lover dig down you use a rubber

Schemin on the ass since the first day

Nows my chance to hit you off daddy Im grown
From the back from the side

Ive been watchin you from afar
for as long as I can remmeber
You are all a real man can need
this is more than a crush
It was Harlem at the Rucker
I saw with your man
smiling huh a coach bag in your hand
I was laying in the coup with my hat turned back
we caught eyes for a moment and that was that
so skated off as you strolled off
looking at them legs god damn they looked so soft so fine
I gotta take ya from your man thats my mision
If his love is real he got ta handle competition
you only knew about 5 months thats right
besides he drinks too much and smokes too many blunts
and Ive been working out everyday thinking bout you
looking at my own eyes in the rear view
cathchin flash backs of our eye contact
wish i could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
i would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
I cant believe it I hadnt had a crush in years
2x hey lover hey lover this is more than a crush
Lover hey lover this is more than a crush
hey lover hey lover this is more than a crush
I see you at the bus stop waitin everyday
your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
but i dont want ta violate your relationship
so i lay back in the cut with a crush thata trip
still he cant stop me from having day dreams
tounging you down with huh vanilla ice cream
kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
searching your body with my tounge girl all night
I wonder one day could it be simple dreams turnin into reality
Our love would come down so naturally
we would walk down the isle of destiny
what your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
break ya off a little chump change to do your hair
that seems to be enough to satisfy your needs
but theres a deeper level if you just follow my lead
Last week I saw ya at the mall
standing at the pay phone bout to make a call
I had a vision it was me on the other end
telling you come by and then you walked in
I touched you gently with my hands
we talked about traveling the distant lands
escaping all the madness out here in the world
becomin my wife no longer my girl
then you let your dress fall down to the floor
i kissed you softly and you yearned for more
into an ocean of love we both fell
swimming in the timeless currents of pure bliss
fantasies interchanging with each kiss
undying passion unities our souls
togehter we swim until the point of no control
but its a fantasy itthatyou wont come true
we never even spoke and your man still love you
so Im gonna keep all these feelins inside
keep my dreams alive until the right timeLyrics submitted by Carlos Rivera

When Im alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
and in the back of my mind I hear my conscience call
Telling me I need a girl whos as sweet as a dove
for the first time in my life I see I need love
There I was giggling about the games
that I had played with many hearts and Im not saying no names
Then the thought occured tear drops made my eyes burn
as I said to myself look what youve done to her
I can feel it inside I cant explain how it feels
all I know is that Ill never dish another raw deal
Playing make believe pretending that Im true
holding in my laugh as I say that I love you
Saying amor kissing you on the ear
whispering I love you and Ill always be here
Although I often reminsce I cant believe that I found
a desire for true love floating around
Inside my soul because my soul is cold
one half of me deserves to be this way till Im old
But the other half needs affection and joy
and the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy
Romance sheer delight how sweet
I gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
You can scratch my back well get cozy and huddle
Ill lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
Ill give you a rose pull out your chair before we eat
kiss you on the cheek and say ooh girl youre so sweet
Its deja vu whenever Im with you
I could go on forever telling you what I do
But where you at youre neither here or there
I swear I cant find you anywhere
Damn sure you aint in my closet or under my rug
this love search is really making me bug
And if you know who you are why dont you make yourself seen
take the chance with my love and youll find out what I mean
Fantasys can run but they cant hide
and when I find you Im gon pour all my love inside
I wanna kiss you hold you never scold you just love you
suck on you neck caress you and rub you
Grind moan and never be alone
if youre not standing next to me youre on the phone
Cant you hear it in my voice I need love bad
Ive got money but loves something Ive never had
I need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
I love you more than a man whos 10 feet tall
Id watch the sunrise in your eyes
were so in love when we hug we become paralyzed
Our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal
youre as soft as a pillow and Im as hard as steel
Its like a dream land I cant lie I never been there
maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
Clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
I swear to you this is something that Ill never forget
See what I mean Ive changed Im no longer
a play boy on the run I need something thats stronger
Friendship trust honor respect admiration
this whole experience has been such a revelation
Its taught me love and how to be a real man
to always be considerate and do all I can
Protect you youre my lady and you mean so much
my body tingles all over from the slightest touch
Of your hand and understand Ill be frozen in time
till we meet face to face and you tell me youre mine
If I find you girl I swear Ill be a good man
Im not gonna leave it in destinys hands
I cant sit and wait for my princess to arrive
I gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
Ill search the whole world for that special girl
when I finally find you watch our love unfurl
When I be sittin in my room all alone staring at the wall
fantasies they go through my mind
And Ive come to realize that I need true love
and if you wanna give it to me girl make yourself seen
I love you Lyrics submitted by kane
I just wanna make sweet love to you baby you know what I’m saying
I just wanna touch you all over… aw please
We Came To Party We Came To Party

Hey look I’ve got my hands all on your body
Verse 1 LL Cool J
Ain’t no problem I’m on it – oldest man in the club
Also one of the richest a hundred bottles of bub
It’s just me and the Russians we get all of the love
They was aware of the image they wanna see what he does
TMZ in my face Oprah all on my couch
Now I’m hosting the Grammys what is this all about
International baller I must admit I had doubts
If they wasn’t callin’ me back they was callin’ me out
Game moved to the South I just closed my mouth
Intellect like Belichick when he be switching the routes
I’m too old for the games no time for the lames
Next challenge Get this generation screaming my name
Who could do what I did Boy I must be the shit
Waved 106 Park to play date with the kids
People texting my wife tryna ruin my night
So I help ‘em mind they business with some bottles on ice
We Came To Party We Came To Party
We Came To Party We Came To Party
We Came To Party We Came To Party
Hey look I’ve got my hands all on your body
We Came To Party We Came To Party
We Came To Party We Came To Party
We Came To Party We Came To Party
Hey look I’ve got my hands all on your body
Oh no… Big Snoop Dogg
Ice so cold you can see it through the fog
To walk in my shoes it’ll be a little jog
And if you step by the pockets you gon’ be up in the morgue
The peoples is peepin’ peepin’
The bitches is dippin’ dippin’
So this is the mission listen I turn this shit up
It’s the partyrocking nonstopping fourhopping rip and rock
Drippin’ in this motherfcker burn up now turn up
Verse 3 LL Cool J
We ain’t flirtin’ we talkin’ – we ain’t dancin’ we walkin’
Teenagers is pointin’ couple cougars are hawkin’
I don’t come here that often but it’s totally awesome
When you livin’ for real I don’t consider it flossin’
Panty lines are crossin’ I’m proceedin’ with caution
I don’t shit where I eat gotta manage your portions
LL Cool J I’m like the oldschool orphan
Representing alone sittin’ on factory chrome
Shades on in the zone – Kool Aid smile on my face
My security’s strapped ain’t no beef just in case
Me and my man Rich Whites we in Vegas tonight
Claudine on the celly make sure that money is right
Red carpet and tuxes always where the bucks is
Paparazzi are snapping I can’t believe this is happening
Frustrating the haters they’re so sick of me rapping
I’m enjoying your blog I’ve got the same type of passion
Fatman Scoop – Maserati Cool J
Fatman Scoop – Maserati Cool J
Fatman Scoop – Maserati Cool J
Fatman Scoop – Maserati Cool J
They ain’t think I can do it that’s why I had to debut it
And let the critics review it that way I spit and it’s Buicks
Since the beginning I knew it – rollin’ an L in the Buick
Had the guts to pursue it that’s how a legend should do it
I got so much trouble on my mind
Hear the drummer get wicked
Time to put em in the dirt somebody gettin hurt
Hard time gets rough
I took a look at my life cuts like a knife
What I have is not enough
I got alot on my mind cross the line
Home boy I cut you up
No reason to rhyme out comes the 9
I got so much trouble on my mind
Hear the drummer get wicked
I cant take it no more
This economys out of control
I kick down your door
Put the weapon to your jaw
This time heads gonna roll
I feel so hard oh my god
Come back and save my soul
Never settle for the silver muff
The Bronx know my style give me that goal
I came to test ya under pressure
Lets see if you paused on 4
Ive taken mine now its the time
I be fighting for my dream my whole life
But this day to day grinding gets old
Its the west coastal going postal
Action who wants that role
I got so much trouble on my mind
Hear the drummer get wicked
Release the beast wheres my feast
Kids gotta eat no defeat
My turn to take your grains
Shoot the ring watch the king
And what I bring is gonna swing
The world like a hurricane
What it feels like to go through
The war that Ive been through
How it can make you mental
Time to lay down take off the crown
Hot stock the pound the time is now
Gotta break these fucking chains
I got so much trouble on my mind
Hear the drummer get wicked
