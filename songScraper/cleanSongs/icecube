Throw tha south side in da air

Ice Cube Verse 1
I am the one that you heard about read about
I am the one that had to take the ghetto route
I am the one dont make me pull this ghetto out
Im comin straight from the cave who let him out
Crazy nigga thought he was gone but he aint gone
Even King Kong took his black monkey ass home
When I hit the block watch them scatter like roaches
So dont be fake cause I know what a hoe is
Handle my business no playin cause Im focused
You the definition of what a fuckin joke is
When they see you comin they play with your emotions
Fuck with my emotions and they find you in the oceans
Yeah I said oceans yeah I mean plural
My boy got a knife to turn a boy into a girl
Well fuck up your world no boos to my drama
Well include yo mama if you fuck with my commas
I aint tryin to scary you
I aint tryin to hear you
I aint tryin to control that nigga in the mirror
Ill Im tryin to is bark before I fight
Before I take you down might as well be polite
Hear em say oh my God here he come here he come
Hear em say oh my God here he come here he come
Hear em say oh my God here he come here he come
Hear em say oh my God here he come here he come
Dont tryin to be no hero you nothin but a zero
Dont tryin to be no hero you nothin but a zero
Dont tryin to be a hero you nothin but a zero
A nigga for the people where ever they go we go
Ice Cube Verse 2
Now when I roll through the hood lil kids watch my every move
Tryin to be a good example dont make me bury you
If you sit on my swagger bitch take some carellflu
Dont underestimate the damage caused by a 22
Pop yo ass right behind the ear within hear
Nothin like a firecracker hits you like a linebacker
Dont forget the grind factor I am a grinder
And heres a reminder aint no tellin where they find ya
Now what this got to do with the price of tea in China
Nothin mothafucka just dont act like a vagina
You wont catch the rath of this hardcore rhymer
Now you got 55 niggas right behind ya
Now you wanna talk it out but we dont negotiate
Now you gotta do all kind of shit that we know you hate
Straight from the west and we got to be respected
Here its going down here em runnin for the exit
Hear em say oh my God here he come here he come
Hear em say oh my God here he come here he come
Hear em say oh my God here he come here he come
Hear em say oh my God here he come here he come
Dont tryin to be no hero you nothin but a zero
Dont tryin to be no hero you nothin but a zero
Dont tryin to be a hero you nothin but a zero
A nigga for the people where ever they go we go
See this boy in this bitch gonna ape shit
Glitch Mob niggas takin off like a spaceship
Pace those to Euros eatin those green and great chips
Get em by the bag you can say we Feedo Lay chips
Im so hungry that I can eat these niggas faces
Beat the plastic surgeons givin Hollywood a face lift
Off the grape shit and Im feelin like Im faceless
The Mob you aint in nigga dont say shit
You aint nothin to play with nigga I beat the basics
Cock and spray shit quick to leave a nigga faceless
Playin Superman we get a brave nigga sprayed quick
Niggas cant fade this music for the ages
Because we get it in like Young Crush
She be payin big fishin
In the water bitch you in the deep end
Boy I pull you deep in underneath the deep end
Nigga have you sinkin when I hear you creepin hear you sayin
I can show you the Palms the Mall
The Taj Mahal to the strip in MIA
I can show you the waterfalls in Spain and Progue
To the beach in Saint Tropez
I can show you the world girl the world girl but
Aint nothin else like LA
I can show you the world girl the world girl but
When they come to LA they got the wrong impression
When they come to LA they got to learn they lesson
When they come to west coast its such an obsession
When they come to play it out Im just an exception
When they come to you girl I need your affection
Everytime you walk by you get my inspection
And all you gotta do now is make your selection
And it wont be hard to win this election
I can show you the Palms the Mall
The Taj Mahal to the strip in MIA
I can show you the waterfalls in Spain and Progue
To the beach in Saint Tropez
I can show you the world girl the world girl but
Aint nothin else like LA
I can show you the world girl the world girl but
I done been around the world

Tokyo is cool yeah I flew to UK
But cant nothin fuck with Cali Forn I A
Especially LA Im feelin the bay
But nothin like rollin down PCH
Top down westbound its all good
You dont know Hollywood when you from Hollywood
Lets go to the hood and fuck with the haters
Then to the staples center hang with the Lakers
Number 6 is cool but 24s the champ
And even D Wade and Chris Bosh know that
I can show you the Palms the Mall
The Taj Mahal to the strip in MIA
I can show you the waterfalls in Spain and Progue
To the beach in Saint Tropez
I can show you the world girl the world girl but
Aint nothin else like LA
I can show you the world girl the world girl but
Aint nothin else like LA

They always pick LA over Miami
I love Miami I aint dissin Miami
But where you u rather get rob for your Grammy
Aint nothin like Sunset Blvd
Compton and Watts if you wanna be hard
We got it all what you thought not at all
If you sicker then shit then take a Tylenol
Its just me and my woman
And we takin a bow
They dont wanna be found
If God was lookin for em I can show him around
I can show you the Palms the Mall
The Taj Mahal to the strip in MIA
I can show you the waterfalls in Spain and Progue
To the beach in Saint Tropez
I can show you the world girl the world girl but
