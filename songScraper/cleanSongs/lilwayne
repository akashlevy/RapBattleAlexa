Its Lil Weezy for real
Only Cash Money Hot Boy that stood still
I got a good deal
Im from a trill hood
Slide on them skinnies in the bike with an ill hood
Pipes rally stripes and fog lights
Tshirt white three stripes with all ice
Fool was smile but five is so wild
I can smoke a green mile
Got a chrome need a Rolls shined up for you baby
Blingblao I rock a throwback Jordan 23
Tote a big glock 23
Youre looking at the seventeen ward of New Orleans
I want you to look hard at some easy money
Stop playing this is Weezy company
Im the son of Cash Money
The fodd of the squad
And Baby bout to buy me a house in the sky
Why Cuz Im so fly
When my feet touch the ground sometimes I gotta ask myself why
Coupe kinda wide but I move sorta quick
Looking for my roof where it went
Mink on the floor big shoes on the bent
Windows are the tint more wood than a bench
Working in the hood more green than the Grinch
Please dont play cuz Im connected like Sprint
Leaves on the tray popping up the backend
Peppermint leather with a feather in my brim
Sucking on my wrist real breezy
And this is what I say when you see me
Look and leave your broad at home she get took
Cuz Im a player hold the game by the book
But hoes holla look at Lil Wayne
In that boogergreen lay like shouldve been Mace
Sweet do speak when I shouldve put trays

So move over what you say shortie
We could do rent pussy

And beating went to the A
But yeah Im on my way

When I reappear bet da boss look so bright
Fo life dough boy More strikes O boy
We ridin low Gettin high
80 round drum let ya know da time
When you see da Maybachs nigga know its mine
Ridin on da 2 4s runnin ahead of my time
Watch runnin from kind Anotha one on my mind

Lil Wayne verse 1
Excuse my charisma vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat call my shit patricia
Young money militia and i am the commissioner
You dont want start weezy cause the f is for finisher
So misunderstood but whats a world without enigma
Two bitches at the same time synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch but i fuck her like i missed her
Life is the bitch and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin what a fuckin family picture
You know father time we all know mother nature
Its all in the family but i am of no relation
No matter whos buying im a celebration
Black and white diamonds fuck segregation
Fuck that shit my money up you niggas just honey nut
Young money running shit and you niggas just runnerups
I dont feel i done enough so ima keep on doing this shit

Lil Wayne verse 2
Okay i lost my mind its somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you dont understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named tammy
But hoes gon be hoes so i couldnt blame tammy
Just talked to moms told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up call it self defense
Swear man i be seeing through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they hemen pow pow the end
Talking to myself because i am my own consultant
Married to the money fuck the world thats adultery
You full of shit you close your mouth and let yo ass talk
Young money eating all you haters do is add salt
Stop playing bitch i got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp i fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these muthafuckas talking crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty half full ill spill ya
Try me and run into a wall outfielder
You know ima ball til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor i enjoy em while they still ripe
Bitch stop playing i do it like a king do
If these niggas animals then ima have a mink soon
Tell em bitches i say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth but i guess thats a foreign language to yall
And i call it like i see it and my glasses on
But most of yall dont get the picture less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothing you dont know the half of it
Paper chasing tell that paper look im right behind ya
Bitch real gs move in silence like lasagna
People say im borderline crazy sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams i dont sleep so i cant find her
You niggas are gelatin peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishing well now wish me well
Tell em kiss my ass call it kiss and tell
Word to my mama im out of my lima bean
Dont wanna see what that drama mean get some dramamine
Llama scream hotter than summer sun on a ghana queen
Now all i want is hits bitch wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas thats tryna front and see
Son of gunz son of sam you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech i glow like buddha
Disturb me and youll be all over the flow like luda
Bitch i flow like scuba bitch im bald like cuba
And i keep a killer ho she gon blow right through ya
I be macking bout my stacking now i pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as i i come laugh at your ruler
Cash money cold bitch but our actions is cooler
Wayne these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That i keep these bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these i fuck these on your mind pause
To feed them on my grind did i get a little love
Keep throwing my sign in the middle
Hit em up piece on my side cause aint no peace on my side bitch
Im a man i visit urinals abroad

I see you with your palms in your pants
But me me see me I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger Im a critical thinker
Im a hell of a smoker and a bit of a drinker
I know your name yeah
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking bout abortion
I woke up this morning dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly called Makaveli
He says he was gravy I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror said Yous an ill nigga
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think Ill have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of asskissers and dick pullers
Im tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
Im shooting for the stars astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah I bought a brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears I got my dancin shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on I Dont Give a Fuck Avenue
I see you with your palms in your pants
But me me see me I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger Im a critical thinker
Im a hell of a smoker and a bit of a drinker
I know your name yeah
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking bout abortion
Down on the ceiling looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble better check the point spread
And when life sucks I just enjoy the head
Im so sick of these niggas I need meds
Smoking on that hallelujah thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R Im a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass and everybodys looking
But how can you get the picture if you dont know who took it
This current affairs but who the hell cares
Everybodys fighting over positions musical chairs
On the road to redemption you gonna use a few spares
Im just fucking ready so I come prepared
I know your name yeah
We in the belly of the beast
And she thinking bout abortion
And the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air
Life is a roller coaster but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise we dont know that its there
I see you with your palms in your pants
But me me see me I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger Im a critical thinker
Im a hell of a smoker and a bit of a drinkerLyrics submitted by Awesome AJ

nobody can stop us I was brought up in the projects
and I got tonz of haze from uptown

niggaz always drilling me ‘till they see my four pound
bitches always feeling me try to give me some head
while Im in the studio try to make that bread
not a contriet dude or of with ya head
yo 1st Infantry and fed
we gonna give you that gangsta music that hurts your ears
but the fear in ya heart when you see the gift
we think big ALC we get right
Yo everytime I rest I put it all on the line
thats why I barely get blessed
thats why I rarely go out unless its love at the club
time is bread thats what Im about
and all my peoples got cloud
one step closer to goal everyday
the game is to be sold not told
I tropping heavingly world connected got the livest crew
we infinite dropping gems but no clue
Every dollar I spend on wax I turn it back into cash
Jetting back to the lab Im getting back on my job
Im fully backed by the Mobb I keep my back to the wall
keep the blacks to my wall
Im trying to stack till I ball
untill they cashing ‘em all
I wanna stack till this tall
aint gonna rap for to long
gonna have to move on
Im gonna stash till Im gone
green grass on my longue
fuck a bank account I need extreme cash in my palm
smoke blur in ya vision
you dont know who ya dissin
I dont learning no lesson
I just hold my position
I dont go with a pistol
they just know Im official
shit all I gotta do is start blowing a whistle
right now Im speaking but these beats are what Im famous for fleaking
Its like rolling dice we taking the bank tonight
cut your face with a knife now your scared for life
all I want is ice a car a girl and a crib
tired of doing biz I just wanna live
take care of my kids fuck all that stress
never wore a vest only holding tecs
We sold out every store in LA
Its loyalty where I stay but aint promised today
I keep my headlights on for 911
and on July 4th I might shoot one at the sun
independent regardless of the fact Im a signed artist
fuck a deal it matters who comes hardest
when I entertain Its like I took Sedrick for his name
hunger is just a different form of pain
Im ready to eat ready to hear my name spread on the street
to the point where I dont talk my trackrecord speaks
to the point where I do a joint that night it leaks
to the point where Alchemist is a hundred grand a week
bringing the heat so clear you understand me
raise the stakes up the antique

Young Money militia and I am the commissioner

got the girl twisted cause she open when you twist her
never met the bitch but I fck her like I missed her
life is the bitch and death is her sister
sleep is the cousin what a fckin family picture
you know father time we all know mother nature
its all in the family but I am of no relation
no matter whos buying Im a celebration
black and white diamonds fck segregation
fck that shit my money up you nggas just Honey Nut
Young Money running shit and you nggas just runnerups
I dont feel I done enough so Ima keep on doing this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tunafish
okay I lost my mind its somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you dont understand me
had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
but hoes gon be hoes so I couldnt blame Tammy
just talked to moms told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up call it self defense
swear man I be seeing through these nggas like sequins
nggas think they HeMen pow pow the end
talking to myself because I am my own consultant
married to the money fck the world thats adultery
you full of sht you close your mouth and let yo ass talk
young Money eating all you haters do is add salt
stop playing bitch I got this game on deadbolt
mind so sharp I fck around and cut my head off
real ngga all day and tomorrow
but these muthafckas talking crazy like they jaw broke
glass half empty half full Ill spill ya
try me and run into a wall outfielder
You know Ima ball til they turn off the field lights
the fruits of my labor I enjoy em while they still ripe
bitch stop playing I do it like a king do
if these nggas animals then Ima have a mink soon
tell em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth but I guess thats a foreign language to yall
and I call it like I see it and my glasses on
but most of yall dont get the picture less the flash is on
satisfied with nothing you dont know the half of it
paper chasing tell that paper Look Im right behind ya
bitch real Gs move in silence like lasagna
people say Im borderline crazy sorta kinda
woman of my dreams I dont sleep so I cant find her
you nggas are gelatin peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
yeah with a swag you would kill for
money too strong pockets on bodybuilder
jumped in a wishing well now wish me well
tell em kiss my ass call it kiss and tell
Word to my mama Im out of my lima bean
dont wanna see what that drama mean get some Dramamine
llama scream hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
now all I want is hits bitch Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you nggas thats tryna front and see
son of Gunz Son of Sam you nggas the son of me
pause for this dumber speech I glow like Buddha
disturb me and youll be all over the flow like Luda
bitch I flow like scuba bitch Im bald like Cuba
and I keep a killer ho she gon blow right through ya
I be macking bout my stacking now I pack like a mover
shout to ratchet for backing out on behalf of my shooter

Cash Money cold bitch but our actions is cooler
Wayne these nggas out they mind
I done told these fck nggas so many times
that I keep these bucks steady on my mind

There’s a couple married bitches in the building
I get them out I get that pussy
I see you niggas got no life Sixth Sense
She said she wanna fuck my brains out
But she gonna have to suck this dick first Preach
She sat on my dick she sat on my face
I told that bitch she got good seats
Man these niggas softer than fleece
2D niggas and they obliques
You talked that shit I knock you out now go ahead and talk in your sleep
Bitch you know the motto
It’s Young Money over hoes
Lying to these bitches they call my dick Pinnochio
Gettin’ to the money now the money getting to me
She say my verdick is hung like a jury
I’m on the track DOA
Some of these niggas be DEA
But she be like “No way Jose”
I got all that white
What you call that OKKK
Every night I go hard
She blow me like Boston George
She like it in her ass mouth and pussy
These niggas is false alarms
They don’t mean no fuckin harm
Hey baby let’s make a porn
You know that I ain’t got no ceilings
The money changed me I’m making chameleons
Only God can judge me can’t appeal it
In the name of the Father Son Holy Spirit
Tell them alphabet boys it’s a “G” thing
I’ve got a street sweeper do you need your street cleaned
Young Money bitch We colder than a ski team
Red beam if you scared mufucka go to church
I’m on that grass harder than cleats
I’m on that gas y’all on E
Nigga my cash out of your reach
I run shit like the reverend
She get on her knees for this dick
Then swallow all of them blessings
It’s just a way of life
Bought my mama a crib
Bought my daddy a car
Let him go meet Tune
Now they think I’m a star
Damn I love this life wouldn’t trade it for nothing
Most theses rappers is falling cause they ain’t standing for nothing
I smoke that loud so I don’t hear haters talking
Plus these bitches be stalking trying look for a fortune
In the Chi we say church when the pussy gets purchase
Got a bitch so bad she make a player get nervous
Now good ain’t good enough and my hood is hood as fuck
I be praying for them shortys trynna get their dollars up
Swag so dope you probably think I’m dealing
And I only give head if baby girl swallow children
Boo ain’t got a ghost and bitches still be catch the holy ghost
She say she want to get high I hit her with that overdose
Pimpin’ so cold put that on my overcoat
We don’t do 100 spokes
When broke niggas talk that’s 100 jokes
Ha Laughing at you fuck boys
Skate gear I’m a truck boy
On my truck right I don’t give a fuck boyLyrics submitted by Osama Sleem

Good evening Ladies I tell you from the start

Theres lots of activities fun things to do
And Ill find my pleasure in pleasing you
Some rides go fast some rides go slow
You fear heights when Im high hell yeah Ill go low
It tastes so sweet that sticky cotton candy
We get carried away we be startin a family
Its a perfect time for a magic trick
Girl you know its no fun without the magic stick
Now watch me as I pull a rabbit out a hat
Then you can use the rabbit all over your cat
Applause now thats the first half of my act
Started out a pimp now Im more like a mac

Theres plenty water rides Im sure to get you wet in the park
Have your lusters seduction considered or not
Throw a hoop around the bottle Ill be your teddy bear
Whatever color you like you know I dont care
I really want to thank you for attending this affair
Now go encourage your friends to come have fun here
I smile when I speak but Im being sincere
And your pass is valid all summer my dear
So watch everything that you can always return
Theres so many tricks to the trade you should learn
Suck that lick that swallow that lollipop
Forget that grip that ride it nonstop
Shorty you aint gotta take ya panties off just pull em to the side
If you wanna ride on the roller coaster baby come on and ride
It go up and down and round and round
Stand up or get on the floor

I think about the block keep it close like treasure
Keep it packed away where no one come in to
Got pulled out of the mix like forever and ever
I thought you told me how you felt about it in your letter
But that is all behind me like georgio armani
Im sipping campari feed my dog salami
Never gave nobody up I did my time I didnt bitch
Since I been back I heard you switched
But Im back on the block and the air tastes sweeter
Yeah Im back on the block and I barely believe ya
Yeah Im back on the block and the air tastes sweeter
Yeah Im back on the block
I remember the block and how it all began
You was a ramblin man with a shake in your hand
Now when they ran up fisty cuts in the plan
One who does it who you was
So you dropped it on the cousin and you blamed it on me
He said nothing to the man but he said something to me
One two three but still I gave him the fifth
But since Ive been back I heard you switched
And she keeps goin on and on about it hmm hmm
And he keeps goin on and on and on about it
And drunk eddie from the store he keeps goin on and on about it
He keeps goin on and on about it
Chorus 4xLyrics submitted by Leandra
You think you’re ballin cause you got a block
He think he ballin cause he got a block
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball
You think you’re ballin cause you got a block
He think he ballin cause he got a block
You know these hoes love to see me ball
You know these hoes came to see me ball
Young Jeezy Verse 1
Hopped up out the bed I think my roof gone
Think I forgot to put my roof on
Said “fuck it buy another car”
Said “fuck it bought another car”
I bought the Phantom just to say it’s black
I bought the Phantom just to take a nap
I’m getting head in the backseat
I might stop and stand it tall like a athlete
I’m ballin’ hard I need a jersey on
So much bread on me I can buy a Jersey home
I’m on them Diddy’s spendin’ Dirty Money
I’m on that Jizzle spendin’ my money
Young Jeezy Verse 2
Still ballin’ like a muthafucker tell ‘em that
Three platinum chains to match my platinum plaques
Ain’t got nuttin’ gold but some gold chains
Say “Jizzle what’s the dough”
My celly bumpin’ like a chat line
He bought a 500 need he need a halftime
If yo job ain’t ballin’ hard then you need to quit
You need a A T hard then you need to split
I’m poppin’ bottles in the club that’s what winners do
They claiming bitches them my old hoes
They claim they ballin’ in my old flows
These hoes call me Tunechi baby
Niggas think they seeing me they hallucinating
Bitch I’m ballin’ ballin’ like a muthafucker
12 gauge bitch I got a dozen of them
Nigga broke acting like he got it though
I’m with a Spanish bitch if she aint fucking adios
So many cars I’m like eenie meenie minie moe
So many colours in the diamonds Kaleidoscope
Last year I made a hundred million dollars flat
Run in ya house and get to poppin’ at your shower cap
My homies got them firebirds like Pontiac
And if them bitches don’t sell we buy em back
Where the strippers tell em Tune on his way
Tell them niggas I’m strapped like lingerie
I aint trippin I’m ballin call me NBA
II aint trippin I’m ballin call me NBA
Young Jeezy Chorus x2
You think you’re ballin cause you got a block
He think he ballin cause he got a block
You know these hoes came to see me ball
You know these hoes love to see me ball
You think you’re ballin cause you got a block
He think he ballin cause he got a block Lyrics submitted by Shadi Dubaisi

And when it comes down to guns nigga I sleep with em
See we can sweep with em cause it get deep with em
And when it comes down to drugs Im on the streets with em
Im the youngest Hot Boy on the field with heaters
Let my ninemillimeters kill your peoples
Bust up in your house and put the gun to lil Renita

Nasty case nigga run up in your crib crash the place
Blast the face automatic attach to waist
You bastards play Then it get awful and bad
There will be no more walkin for dad and its off with your head
A nigga either gon get it right or they get it at night
And when they spit it lick his ass twice like 20 damn dice
Henny and ice is what I prefer but light on the rocks
I pack them clips tight on them glocks and light up your blocks
And if theres coke involved then your throats involved
I get the toaster and roll up and smoke most of yall
Me and my nigga Super Sosa run up in your crib
While your grandma watchin Oprah jag her up and rope her

Hustlas make the world go round
The world is made of keys ounces and pounds
The keys ounces and pounds is made from hustlas
See how shit come back round for ya
Gotta cop it chop it and cook it
See how shit come back round for ya
Gotta kick in the oven now watch it bubble
And you can knock on my door
But you cant knock the hustle
But I its like a game of twentyone and I got nineteen
And my Jake but I put more d on me
Lil Weezy Wee gon eat thats how it is
Got insurance on the floor man Im that positive
And Im shaggy in the saggy lens
Me an my squad in the paddy wagon tally Benz
And you know I put the mags on that
45 mack with the flash on that
Now Ima ride cuz I got riding in my bloodline
And Ima shine cuz I got shining in my bloodline
I get that dough cuz I got hustle in my bloodline
And when I move I move out with the raw
I move out with the squad
To his album we ride we so mob
I throw lives and lowest to live
For my loaf of bread the peoples player
I did what the culture said
And I live by the coast of Nostre Cid
Fuck around Ill knock your shoulder from your head
Get it right Im a soldier till Im dead
This kid is white with buttonholes inside that bled
Im pumping os with lots of hay
Im so high and really I dont even know why
And oh I just go buy a whole house
And lay my mat down lay her back down
But I never put my mack down
You see the thug in me
You know Weezy he the young son of BubbaB
Buy my basketball shorts with a thunder B
If you want it then come to me
Only follow the code of the streets
Live bad to die good
Know how to move when hustling by the days with no food
But just so I can eat
And aint it a bitch
And if you see me getting fat Im probably getting rich
And you probably can see me for some crack before six
And after that its all bricks
A fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight
And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam
I skate with the bomb
Im asking you dont play with me at all
Shots hit your ass and make three of yall
Itll take three of yall to fill one of my shoeprints
Cuz I did and do shit thats better than new shit
The kid is a nuisance
Awww man hes inspired by his own gangsta music
Cruising through stoop with the ewe lit
Like ooh shit this is more than weed its 500 Degreez

I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money Im an hour past paid
Ughh gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah I put it down like my hands hurting

Some of us are lovers most of yall haters
But I put up a wall and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me I stay hatefree
They say we learn from mistakes so thats why they mistaking me
I got some weight on my shoulders to me its like feathers
All hail Weezy call it bad weather
I stick to the script I memorize the lines
Cause Life is a movie that Ive seen too many times
Youre on the outside looking in close the blinds
And they say never say never but fuck it never mind

Lil Wayne I GOT IT
Verse 1 Lil Wayne
Murder capital only key to survive is kill
If the elements dont murder you the riders will fo real
And niggas know I goes hard to the fullest
Get involved and I got em playing dodge ball with bullets
I got the sawed off fully in the sean john hoody
Get fucked ya play pussy
We hit em up while they aint lookin and them body shots hurt
And the head shots took him
And if the read dot spot him then the hollow head got him
Knock his top to his bottom jack
You see me grind from the bottom just to make it to the bottom
At the very bottom of the map
Loueasyana pirahnnas everywhere you at
You gotta wear an extra condom and an extra gat
Yo bitch could get it for actin like a man
Them niggaz in Pakistan impactin on ya man
I back his hand ya man on command
In front of niggaz he cool with the boys on fan
Im on hot I adjust in different climates duckin the animal keep on runnin wit
You aint did it till you done it like in 5 states
Weezy hustle no blubber I put on weight
And in a drought I go on I diet and stretch more
Loose all that weight leave a nigga with stretch marks
You dont even come up to a nigga chest part subpar
What the fuck they play it in the club for
Real shit Im duckin bombs from a drug war
No religion but the cops swear that Im a drug lord
Father forgive em for they know not who they pushin lord
Father forgive me if I have to send them to ya lord
Im just tryin to dodge the shots they send to the god
They riding up highway to heaven boulevard
Damn them niggaz pussy and jive not even in an eye exam they aint lookin for I
The A and the K will make ya face crook to the side
Now when you smiling everybody gotta look from the side
cause when you wildin you aint lookin you just lookin high
And when we hungry you look like pie
Sweet potato ass nigga you lemon merangue apple custard cherry jelly
Dont make me get the biscut buster
What up gizzle you my distant brother
Real shit nigga same father different mother yep
I skip the frontin and sticks to keepin it trill
You not know me for nothing other Im something other them people you feel Im deeper for real
Im deeper than skills my speeches can kill
Yeah you underdig shorty its all about one thing nigga
If you bout money nigga come fuck with us
If you aint bout money get the fuck from round us nigga
And whatever you bout we bout it however you wanna get it we can give it to ya
Put ya prints in nigga
Put ya feet down and ya nuts on the concrete and lets roll
Verse 2 Lil Wayne
You sleep in a field for tryin the dude
I bust ya head to the meat turn ya mind to food
Food cruelful thought think I aint lying to you
I lie his body in grease set fire to him
I tie his body in sheets put the tires to him
Make him feel the escalade put his feet in the blades
Im the heat in the blaze a nigga keep they ways when Im in the streets with blades
Watch my nigga hungry hell eat the plate
And if I ask the homeboy will eatcha face
And though he got me you can ask Im like a pool table
My side pocket sideways when I pop it leave a nigga sideways for five days
Yeah nigga I tell em I tell em again shorty
If it aint about money get all the fuck from round us
Verse 3 Lil Wayne
Check my swag I travel like sound dawg
You play hard in the gravel like ground dog
Im underground call me groundhog
Lay down laws call me ground law
Dont confuse me with the law naw but just confuse me with my pa
Because I am the Birdman JR
I aint trippin nigga I play the corner like ripkin nigga
With the 40 cal ripkin nigga rip a nigga
Flip ya vehicle split ya windshield
Whack ya Baby momma but I let the kid live
And people say that I am a kid still cause the lil nigga still ride on big wheels
You feeling animal then come on and get killed
And sig pill bandannas like bananas
Say Im slight bananas I blew a weekend in havana
In my cabana with my bottom bitch from savahnna

Gotta ride big cuz i am like a captain
You know im a boss chillen relaxin
Probably in my office doin my taxes
You little niggas so not in my bracket
And I dont even have time to practice

Your camera has never saw a picture this nice Hmm

And if she doesnt wear panties then Ill fuck her on sight

But before she start singin she gotta check my Mic
And I dun lost sight

You talkin that shit but you boys just hype
I hope you bring a gun to the fight Aight
Louis V tennis shoes big brown stripe

Brand new coupe drivin crazy then the mothers
Sittin low in the seats with the burner sittin under
Got my tank top toppe on it
But I ride like that cuz Im hotter than the others
Damn theres no keepin up with the brother man
I can spell my name in burnt rubber
Now the dog is at supper
You can wash my plate an put it back in the cupboard
Im so far ahead of them suckers
Im gonna have to start rappin in numbers
I promise the flows dont stop they come rappin like thunder
I bet you hide under your covers
This here is on some truthful shit
Its seems like everything I do your use to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who youve been with
Thats when I gotta hide what Im feeling inside
So you still think Im confident and dumb
Your up on a pedastool
Are we moving too fast
Feels Like Im in crazy competition with the past
Thats why I gotta ask
Is anything Im doin Brand New
Is anything Im doin Brand New
This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you atempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I dont ever question you were dumb
I cant even find the perfect brush
So i can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself but Im a couple steps behind
Thats why I gotta ask
Is anything Im doing Brand New
Is everything Im doing to late
Did he take your clothes off just like this
Did he give you loving just this
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very 1st date
Tell me baby Am I too lateLyrics submitted by ty
Uhh alright uh huh alright uh
Verse 1 Lil Wayne
Nice tires on the Ghini
You should want to king me
Brain dead flow vegetable zucchini
I live on the beach
She walk around in her bikini
And I cut them like seniors
The bears from the penguins
Life is just a gap
Get some money in between it
Be cool before you get stumped and pulled out the party
HoHollygrove shit I’m on my Hollygrove shit
Looking for a bad bitch I give her dinosaur dick
Big bad flow Weezy fuck the police’s
Church like a choir and a couple of old priest’s
Elevator in my crib cause its five floors
I’m not expecting you to have one inside yours haha
Vince Young suicide doors haha
Life’s a bitch and I’d die for her
Verse 2 Short Dawg
I have the type of flow niggas don’t have to like
My rhymes is ambidextrous so I don’t have to write
The way I’m eating niggas wish they had my appetite
Straight up out of Texas and I’m major like apple white
I pour a four then I hit the exit door
Take a trip to Macy’s cop the whole second floor
Whores smell the scent of money coming out my pores
Yeah my pockets full of dead people like a morgue bore
I made it from a flyer to the Forbes
Young Elvis Freshly yes he flyer than the store
Dropping babies out and your chicks cheek kicks neat
Got your son looking up to me like I’m 6 feet
Your daughter needs someone to save her not me
I knocking hoes down like Leila Ali
Try me and I’mma put the toaster to your kidney
Then I pull off in a Bentley top open like a chimney
God Damn it’s No Ceilings like a Coliseum
Candy slab paint dripping like gonorrhea
The way I’m leaning I’mma nod if I stand still
Flow harder than an anvil Short
Verse 3 Gudda Gudda
All about my bills like Buffalo
Your bitch under my sheets
I heard she was an undercover hoe
Purple got me moving slow
Like I’m in a snail race
Pop pop pop 3 shots to the head
Then I pick up my shell case
Leave them with a pale face
Yes I am a Young Money goon
Your girl like a motion picture she gonna be cumming soon
I do her something rude I pop her like balloons
I pass her off to Millz then drop her off to Tune
Couple screws lose you don’t want to play with him
This is No Ceilings bitch roofless like a stadium
We shut down every fucking spot these bitches see us in
You want us in ya club well nigga pay us then
All grey BM I’m getting for my baby M
She told me get the money and count it for me when I rake it in
Don’t play no games hoe
You know my name hoe

Niggaz bitchin and I gotta tuck the cannon
Listen close I got duct tape and rope
Ill leave you missin like the fuckin O bannons
One hand on my money on hand on my buddy
Thats the AK47 made his neighborhood love me
Bullets like birds you can hear them bitches hummin
Dont let that bird shit he got a weak stomach
Niggaz know Im sick I dont spit I vomit
One egg short of the omelet
Simon says shoot a nigga in his thigh and leg
Then tell him catch up like mayonnaise um
Im the sickest nigga doin it
These other niggaz dope Im wet crack baby yes
Get back get back boy its a set back
Clumsy ass niggaz slip and fall into a death trap
Them boys pussy born without a backbone
And if you strapped we can trade like the Dow Jones
Wet him up I hope he got his towel on
I aim at the moon and get my howl on
Some niggaz cry wolf Im on that dry Cush
And when it comes to that paper I stack books
You heard what I said
I can put you on your feet or put some money on your head
If you cant pay the fee
Shout out my nigga fee
See every mother fucker at the door dont get a key
You outside lookin in so tell me what you see
Its about money its bigger than me
I told my homies dont kill him bring the nigga to me yea
Dont miss you fuckin with the hit man
Kidnap a nigga make him feel like a kid again
Straight up I aint got no conversation for ya
Nigga talk to the cannon
Have a few words with the cannon
Tell it to my mother fuckin cannon
From Philly to where Im landin Ima cannon
And Im on that Philly fire shit
Then I come fully equipped
You try me get bodied keep you and the shawtie in the whip
If a nigga try to stick me Ima blam him
Single on them tititired of them free got the butters got the green and got the tan Got the whole enchilada
Homie know Im inside of your house
Make the prick call up your mother she might know where to find you
I am on top of my job
The heavyweight champ of the flow
Its flow like the ocean open water you drownin
I will fore drown them and sink them heat them and leave them stinkin
Sharks surround them and eat them nice then know that I will
Roll over ya squad like Im a one punch card
You chumps you best call General Motors
I will take control of your soldiers
You wont listen till I toss them in the wok like chicken
I make it hard for rap niggaz Im peer pressure
Matter fact Im motivation to rap better
I show niggaz how to act how to dress better
I stay fresh more fitted caps than bat catchers
Im the crack the smack the gun the rule the gat the strap the gun the tool the Mother fuckin cannon
Other words Im the real for real
We can go check for check or bill for bill
We can go chick for chick or skill for skill
Niggaz aint real as will cause Ima cannon

And I got the 50 cal mag its a handheld
Im tellin you niggaz I pop put a shell in you niggaz
My nice watchll Helen Keller you niggaz
I got whores in the cannon camcorder bendin over
Blowin game by the quarter weed over in the corner nigga
Yea yea Detroit red gettin change like them white folks
Dump it out the window of the range wiht the right folk
Pain like a bitch the first day of her cycle
You better scurry when I pull the cannon
Straps burn the streets like a truck through the gas
I love head and caressin a voluptuous ass
I ask your baby momma is she up to the task
She like damn red its bigger than a cannon
My attire makes the ladies say your man is too fly
Imported oils from Iran and Dubai
Get caught slippin with ya mans and you die
Where Im from niggaz be quick to squeeze the cannon
Detroit red always got some shit for ya ear
Show me love but keep it movin man cause if you get near
Ill say get off my dick and tell ya bitch to come here
Cause you sweatin me and my dj like cannon
Legs spread far out you know how Im standin
Yea Im posted with the big homie cannon

Bitch Im married to the game and I love my wifey
Steppin over competition man I love these Nikes
Niggaz tryna copy my style like the cannon
Dont try to compare Im in a league of my own

This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do your used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who youve been with
Swear I gotta hide what Im feelin inside

She used to go to catholic school back in the day
Now she strippin in Sues for a stack a day
But she bring it all to daddy so thats okay
I got bitch named Lola true dick smoker
parttime broker late nights she work at strokers

I dont use a cordless microphone avoid em
They dont feel real to me
Others peeled on me like paint
You the primer on the lime bean green box when I couldnt afford a Ford
Clean socks scootin across the floor in your grandmama house
You yap too much about the penny ante this mechanic so uncanny
Xmen xmen your ex boyfirend should thank me that I took you off his
No I can bring another beach to the sand
And know I am well aware that you can bring a man to his knees
And get what you need without saying please
But can you bring a man to his feet when defeat is on repeat
And they go put this mans Grammys on the street
Hate that all of our memories happened in a Hyatt
You were perfect before you went on a diet
You was way thicker you think I dont remember
Shit the magazine got to your head
Now somebody you dont even know got you in bed
Bet ya buddy dont even know you dont like red
Or was it fuchsia fuck it our future is dead
I thought a pussy cat had 9 lives man
I miss that pussy that pussy that pussy that pussy
She gave away all my shit
I miss that pussy that pussy that pussy that pussy

Marc Jacobs Aviators and a VNeck
10 bitches 10 pistols on the P jet
And a drop top Madena with the top up
Im in that bitch getting net like a shotput
100000 for the grill if I lie I die
Flow sick so sick see the cianide
And heres my most funniest joke Im broke haha
Dont worry bout me the money got me
And I keep the burner on me like an ID
The Lamborghini orange like vitamin C
And leave a bitch stuck like a kite in a tree
Weezy F B the money is the matter
Im working like a bad bladder MOB
DiDiamonds and Girls and girls and girls
Hailing from the bottom of the map
But standing at the top of the game
Kush got a nigga looking like I could really use a nap
But Im still out wildin with the gang
Got diamonds in my chain
More colors than the Northern Lights
Life is a traffic jam but Im on a motor bike
Zigzagging past these bastards laughing at them
I got them suicidal like the doors on the Phantom
Yeah hot spitter nigga who you thought it was
Bitches want to hold me in the morning like a coffee mug
I dont try to lock them down cause Im not an officer
I just knock them down in groups of ten
As if Im in the lane aiming for bowling pins
Then the style switch so quick
Have you thinking that the disc skipped
Make them bring it back like pass interferance

If sometimes you see that Im mad
Dont you know no one alive can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong you see some bad
But Im just a soul whose intentions are good
O lord please dont let me be misunderstood
Misunderstood aint gotta be explained
But you dont understand me so let me explain
Stood in the heat the flames the snow
The wind blow my dreads swang
He had hair like wool like wayne
Dropping ashes in the bible
I shake em out and they fall on the rifle
Scary hail mary no tale fairy
Perry mason facing the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge no gown no gavel
Im a rebel down to battle
Now or never I would never
Fking fantastic fk if you agree
But I dont give a fk if you see me
Im just a soul whose intentions are good
O lord please dont let me be misunderstood
Whats understood aint gotta be explained
So for those who understand meet Dwayne
For 8 and a half months I gave ms cit da pain
Now its young money baby keep the change
My mama say fk em and we the same
So hello mothafka you got some sheets to change
And aint it funny how people change like easter sunday
You know church fit then outfit
Bright pink and green chest look house lit
Bright pinky rings but that aint about this
Excuse my french emotion in my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like its the new fashion
What are you asking if I dont have the answer
Its probably on the web like Im a damn tarantula
But I know you dont understand cause you thought lil wayne is weezy
Im just a soul whose intentions are good
O lord please dont let me be misunderstood
I was watching tv the other day right
Got this white guy up there talking about black guys
Talking about how young black guys are targeted
You see one in every 100 americans are locked up
One in every 9 black americans are locked up
And see what the white guy was trying to stress was that
The money we spend on sending a mothafka to jail
A young mothafka to jail
Would be less to send his or her young ass to college
See and another thing the white guy was stressing was that
Our jails are populated with drug dealers you know crackcocaine stuff like that
Meaning due to the laws we have on crackcocaine and regular cocaine
Police are only I dont want to say only right but shit
Only logic by riding around in the hood all day
And not in the suburbs
Because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood
And you know the other thing is mostly found in you know where Im going
But why bring a mothafka to jail if its not gon stand up in court
Cause this drug aint that drug you know level 3 level 4 drug shit like that
I guess its all a misunderstanding
I sit back and think you know us young mothafkas you know that 1 in 9
We probably only selling the crack cocaine because we in the hood
And its not like in the suburbs we dont have what you have
Why I really dont wanna know the answer
I guess we just misunderstood hunh
You know we dont have room in the jail now for the real mothafkas the real criminals
Sex offenders rapists serial killers

Intro Lil Wayne Nurse
Good Morning Doctor Carter Hey Sweetie
Looks like its going to be a long day Ahh another one hmm what we got
Is suffering from a lack of concept UhHuh
His flow is weak Another one
And he has no style Ugh
OkLet me put my gloves on and my scrubs onDrCarter to the rescue Excuse me if Im late
But like a thief it takes time to be this great
Ha so just wait Your style is a disgrace
Your rhymes are 5th place and Im just grace
One Uno Ace and Im tryin to make your heart beat like bass
But its sweet like cake and I come to fix
Whatever you shall break Where is your originality
You are so fake so picture me like a gallery
Capture What I say All I need is one mic All I need is one take
Like hey brighter then the sun ray got a pistols on the playground
Watch the gun play likeNo kidding No kids in the way
But the kids do watch Gotta Watch what we say Gotta work everyday
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K
Gotta kick it kick it like the sensate
You gotta have faith you gotta gotta wait wait
I think I I think I lost him
Good afternoon Dr Carter Worse
I dont know about this one
vocab and meta fores needs work
and he lacks respect for the game uggghhhhaaaa let me see
Do you think you can save him
Respect is in the heart
So thats where Im a start
And a lot of heart patients dont make it
Cause you could get through anything if Magic made it
And that was called recycling
Something cause you just like it
So you say it just like it
But I say its enlightning
Besides Dr Kanye West is one of the brightest
And Dr Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
And Dr Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest
Authritist in my hand from writing
But Im a docter they dont understand my writing
And you aint Vince Young so dont clash with the Titans
Now let me put some more Vocab in your IV
Like it and love it
And confidence has no budget so pay me no mind I dont walk like I talk it cause Im running I dont do it cause I done it and Im in the emergency punnet
Got dammit I lost another one
Its been a long day
this one is much better than the others
his respect is back up
style is showin strong side of improvement
all he needs now is his swagger
Let me take the gloves off then
Swagger Tighter Then A Yeast Infection
Fly Go Hard Like Yeast Erection
I Stay Tight Like Chinese Connection
I Stay Tight Like Pussy At Night
Baby Dont Get Me Wrong I Could Do That Pussy Right
But Im Too Wrong To Write
I Had To Say It Twice
And Dont Ask Me Shit Unless It Concern A Price
And I Dont Rap Fast I Rap Slow
Cause I Mean Every Letter In The Words In The Sentence Of My Quotes
Swagger Just Flow Sweeter Then Honey Oats
That Swagger I Got It I Wear It Like A Coat
Wait As I Put The Light Down His Throat
I Can Only See Flow
His Blood Starting To Flow
His Lungs Starting To Grow
This One Starting To Show
Wheres The Stitches Heres The Knife
Smack His Face His Eyes Open
I Reply With A Nice Welcome Back
Hip Hop I Saved Your Life
I think we got one
Dr Carter I think we got one
Yep yep we got one
You saved him hes good
we got one hes good
hes goodLyrics submitted by Leandra

I got ice in my veins blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain days of the same
You keep the sunshine save me the rain
I search but never find hurt but never cry
I work and forever try but Im cursed so never mind
And its worse but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on motherfucker
Cause all this bullshit it made me strong motherfucker
So I pick the world up and Im a drop it on your fuckin head yeahh
Bitch Im a pick the world up and Im a drop it on your fuckin head
YEAH And I could die now rebirth mother fucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth
I know what they dont wanna tell you
Just hope youre heaven sent and youre hell proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they cant wipe off
Uhhh my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak and thats a word from the wise
Served to survive murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside
So I could pick the world up and Im a drop it on your fuckin head ha ha yeahh
Bitch Im a pick the world up and Im a drop it on your fuckin head
YEAH And I could die now rebirth mother fucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth
It hurts but I never show this pain youll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit Ive become my backs against the wall
When push comes to shove I just stand up and scream Fuck em all
Man it feels like these walls are closin in
This roof is cavin in but its time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages
And my book of rhymes got them crookin boy
This crooked mind of mine got them all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin clock I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
And butt fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame that aint what I came to claim
But the game aint gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another Im a make these fuckin haters believe it
I swear to God wont spare the rod
Im a man of my word so your fuckin heads better nod
Or Im a fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me that pillow is where your headll lie
Permanently bitch its beddy bye
This world is my Easter egg yeah prepare to die
My head is swole my confidence is up
This stage is my pedestal Im unstoppable
Incredible hulk youre trapped in my medicine bowl
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin headll spin dawg
I split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives
Pick the world up and Im a drop it on your fuckin head yeahh
Bitch Im a pick the world up and Im a drop it on your fuckin head
And I could die now rebirth mother fucker

But I know you watchin peepin down on how Im livin
Ay tell Jesus I said thanks for the blessings he sendin
Please ask him to forgive me for the sins I commit
Just let him know Im still young and at risk
Say Ill never forget the time that you caught me smokin herb in the house
I was dead wrong I deserved to get out
But you just talked it over with my mom and got it situated in due time
Told me get the paper instead of high
So now I take that advice and shed light over my whole life dog
I wanted to be just like you my whole life dog
I cant believe them niggas stole ya that shits pain to me
But dont trip I hold you down you still remain through me
And dog I know I cant see you but I bet that you smilin
And Im a make you even happier I promise
I know you cant be close to my nigga I know
But I know you watchin over me nigga I know
But the shits steady hurtin burn deep
But its alright dog everything gon be alright dog
I know you see my daughter growin up and bad as ever
But she cool cause she do whatever daddy tell her
And your wife shes still the most wonderful woman
I just built her a new house she aint runnin from nothin
B and Slim them niggas still love me like they own child
Ms Rose nerves get bad but still she gon smile
And me Im on some squash it and some debate it
But I know they love it way more than they hate it
And I know you probably laughin at the way I treat these hoes and these
I try love em my BM be trippin
But Rabbit you know one thing I got the game from you every perspective
Thats why I keep the gun at close connection for protection
And you see I left school behind and chose CMB
It was impossible on the road every week but I know enough
And I follow by everything you ever told me think wisely
Watch over me my nigga just guide me
I swear to you man at some times I really wish I was with you
Cause I get fed up with this life and I miss you
Somebody pass me a tissue and let me wipe the tears from my eyes
Yeah nigga I cried its cause I loved you dog
I promise I wont ever put nothin above you dog
So I live my life in dedication of you dog
I know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within
Make me wanna grab that gun and burst again
But I know they got a reason why Im here
And I know they got a reason why you gone
And therefore Im succeedin on my own
But you aint never left me nigga you still dwell in my heart
I cant forget you kept it real from the start
And until my last breath I exhale Im a keep you with me
And when we do meet again Im a keep you with me
And tell them niggas Pac BIG and Pun I said thays my peoples
Watch over me nigga til I see you

A young nigga screamin fuck the world and let em die
Behind tents tryna duck the world and smoke and ride
Got my bandana round my head and pants to my feet
And got my eyes fire red and glocks on my seat
Im tryna stay under intoxication
Cause I lost my father and got a daughter plus Im on probation
Im drinkin liquor like its water gettin pissy drunk
And stayin away from them lil broads that tryin to get me sunk
I keep a choppa in the trunk and my heat on my waistline
Duckin the law cause I aint tryna do no FED time
Sometimes I jus wish I could be away
But I gotta take care of Janae and keep Macita straight
So I just maintain the struggle and I keep tryin
But how can I when my closest people keep dyin
I aint lyin and the law tryna bust my clique
But I scream Fuck the world man Im too young for this
Look I dont curse but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to the gun and made a little girl
And Im still thuggin with my niggas tryna keep it real
And Im still doin for my mother and Im payin bills
Give me a cigarette my nerves bad
The FEDs said they heard that I know where them birds at
And my old lady say she saw me with anotha pigeon
And some lil boys shot up my block and now I gotta kill em
And teachers keep tellin my mamma that Im gettin worse
And now she trippin talkin bout I need to be in church
And my lil girl whole family tryna lie in court
Tryna put me a child on child support
And my own family deny me of what I do cause Im a thugs and stuff
Plus my niggas keep fallin to them drugs and stuff
That dope got these niggas meltin away
Man they got clowns right around me killin they self everyday
We keep fightin but they so strong
I know its hard but dont give up Baby hold on
Just keep ya fate count blessings and whodi keep ya trust
And grab ya nuts and let em know that we dont give a fuck
We dont give a fuck
I mean this world just aint gon never change
So I just keep my head up and my nuts let em hang
Dogg I swear its very rough out here for the youngstas
Like everybody against me cause Im a young thug
Dear Rabbit why they had to kill Rabbit
But Ima keep you alive nigga Im Lil Rabbit
Thats why this lil nigga be thuggin like theres no tomorrow
I only can depend on Macita and CMRr
I try my best to make it through the night and live today
But Im upset so Im steady wipin tears away
And police got me under surveilance when and wherever
Wreckin they brains tryna figure where Im gettin the cheddar
I tell my family just leave me adamnlone
I can handle alla my business this lil man grown
But I try and forget about it and just stand strong
But if everything was cool I wouldnt write this damn song
Look I dont curse but in this verse

We breeze through in the twelve with the judo eyes
Bitches yell I wanna do those guys

Gotta have somethin fast just to get out them jams
Got a big ass crib with a flow lil fuck
Got a roof all glass and that bitch split up
Got a house built look like a Mercedes booth
Ferrari sofa set with the Lambo wrench room
Leskitted up kitchen set and Rolls Royce wall
Jaguar floors and fuck all yall
BMW lights projectors to watch fights
Caddilac Benz white fox for threads
Chin cheddar for Chi tower aint that crazy

Refridge designed like a Lexus with legs
In the fridge its quarters to replace the eggs

VERSE 1 Lil Wayne
I go by Wheezy the Don
Magnificent nigga lot of ice around my neck and freezin the arm
And if a nigga decide to test their chest get completely took off
And if you wonder who the fuck
Its like aint nothin but
On the block everyday sellin rocks and shit
Choppin bricks give the damn cops a dick
We cop a whip and drop a brick thats how we do it
Weed liquor money and guns how we do it
Freak bitch to swallow cum like fluid
Who it be Through his feet Dubbs
Aint nothin sweet cause I cant keep trust
Lil nigga worth well over a mill nigga
Real nigga come around and show up where you live nigga
Pullin out the Ks nigga and all
Wayne bout to damage your home
Nigga bout to go to see the man in the stars
Hoppin out the van with bandanas and all
News cameras takin pictures of your family when your avenues gone
Damn its a shame how the bullets slammed in your brain
How the ice slammed
Thats because she ran into the game
Nigga stop playin with Lil Wayne
It aint a game nigga I dont know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if youre holdin a grudge
Try to take em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Uh fuck with me now they cant fuck with me now
No They cant fuck with me now they cant fuck with me now
Stop playin when ya get it understood
Cause I know if you know whats good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
You dont know me I kill everyone who show love
You have them motherfuckers lookin all up in the woods for ya
VERSE 2 Lil Wayne
Iceberg Shorty pants is saggin forty magnum
Comin out the club on Bacardis staggerin
Ten in the Ferrari wagon braggin
round the court cause some ex just looked at me
Runnin with them cats that be clappin the plastic
Nigga put a cap in your asses
Catch me on the av with the crack and a matic
Hopin that the law dont pass me stash it
First of the month just snatched me a package
Bag it bout to get this motherfucker crackin
If a nigga think about jackin please believe
Pull the bitch back and run up on his parents
Kidnap for his snacks and then whack him
Thats why I try to stay as fars away from beef as I could
Grab me a freak to ease on my wood
Transport coke from each of my hoods
Wheezy Whee CMBs in my blood
seventeens where Im from
And I aint got no feelins for none of these womens
Really though fetticheese is my love
You know the streets made me
And I dont give a damn if you hate me
Until the bigger man do take me
You dont want no violence to keep the quiet
We call my people wild and then we beef in quiet
Or well creep in houses well sweep your momma
So please stay out it or you leave in silence
It aint a game nigga I dont know who told you it was
I put holes in your mug if youre holdin a grudge
Try to take em when you get the gun and load
And the slug check ya low when I bust
Come to show you no love
Uh fuck with me now they cant fuck with me now
Uh they cant fuck with me now them cant fuck with me now
Stop playin when ya get it understood
Cause I know if you know whats good for ya
Come around your hood for ya
You dont know me I kill everyone who show love
You have them motherfuckers lookin all up in the woods for ya
Uh fuck with me now they cant fuck with me now
Uh they cant fuck with me now them cant fuck with me now

Yeah yeah so get lifted yup Haha
I am sittin on the clouds I got smoke comin from my seat

Playin touch football on marijuana street
Or in a marijuana field you are so beneath my cleets
Get high so high that I feel like lying
Down in a cigar roll me up and smoke me cause

Only once the drugs are done that I feel like dying I feel like dying
I feel like I feel like I feel like
Swimming laps around a bottle of Louis the Thirteenth
Jumpin off of a mountain into a sea of Codeine
Im at the top of the top but still I climb
And if I should ever fall the ground would then turn to wine
Pop pop I feel like flying then I feel like frying then
Only once the drugs are done that I feel like dying I feel like dying
Only once the drugs are done that I feel like dying I feel like dying
I feel like I feel like I feel like
I can mingle with the stars and throw a party on Mars
I am a prisoner locked up behind Xanax bars
I have just boarded a plane without a pilot
And violets are blue roses are red
Daisies are yellow the flowers are dead
Wish I can give you this feeling I feel like buying
And if my dealer dont have no more then

Ok hello its da martian space jam Jordans I want this sht forever wake and smell the Garden fresher than the harvest step up to the target if i had one guess than I guess im just New Orleans and I will never stop like im running from the cops hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top life is like a fcking roller coaster then it drops but what should I scream for this is my theme park my minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark pistol on my side you dont wanna hear that thing talk let the king talk check the price and pay attention Lil Wayne thats what they got to say or mention lyrics courtesy of killerhiphopcom Im like Nirvada in the middle of the summer im resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover shhh my foots sleeping on the gas no brake pads no such thing as last

A young nigga screamin fuck the world and let em die
Behind tints tryna duck the world and smokin ride
Got my bandanna round my head and pants to my feet
And got my eyes fire red and glocks on my seat
Im tryna stay under intoxication
Cause I lost my father and got uh daughter plus Im on probation
Im drinkin liquor like its water gettin pissy drunk
And stayin away from them lil broads that tryin to give me some
I keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my wasteline
Duckin the law cause I aint tryna do a day time
Sometimes I just wish I could be away
But I gotta take care of Ganae and keep mrsLetha straight
So I just maintain the struggle and I keep tryin
But how can I when my closest people keep dyin
I aint lyin that the law tryna bust my clique
But I scream fuck the world man Im too young for this
Look I dont curse but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to da gun and made a little girl
And Im still thuggin wit my niggas tryna keep it real
And Im still doin for my mother and Im payin bills
Give me a cigarette my nerves bad
The FEDs said they heard that I know where them birds at
And my old lady say she saw me with anotha brizzle
And some a dem boys shot up my block so now I gotta kill em
And teachers keep tellin my momma that Im gettin worse
And now she trippin talkin bout I need to be in church
And my lil girl whole family tryna lie in court
Tryna put me a child on child support
And whole family deny me of what I do cause Im a thug and stuff
Plus my niggas keep fallin to them drugs and stuff
That dope got these niggas meltin away
Man they got clowns right around me kill they self everyday
We keep fightin but they so strong
I know its hard but dont give up baby hold on
Just keep ya fate count blessings and wodie keep ya trust
And grab ya nuts and let em know that we dont give a fuck
We dont give a fuck
I mean the world just aint gon never change
So I just keep my head up and my nuts let em hang
Dawg I swear its very rough out here for the youngstas
Like everybody against me cause Im a young thug
Dear Rabbit why they have to kill Rabbit
But Ima keep you alive nigga Im Lil Rabbit
Thats why this lil nigga be thuggin like its no tomorrow
I only can depend on macita and CMR
I try my best to make it through the night and live today
But Im upset so Im steady wipin tears away
And police got me under surveilance when and wherever
Wreckin they brains tryna figure where Im gettin cheddar
I tell my family just leave me adamnlone
I can handle all a my business this lil man grown
But I try to forget about it and just stand strong
But if everythang was cool I wouldnt write this damn song

Daddy is back in town
With the back of my Caddy slanted down
And the mack goes black if you ask around
Put some hash in that grass that you pass around

This song right here is dedicated to the president of the United States of America
Yall might know him as George Bush
But where Im from lost city of New Orleans we call him this
This song is dedicated to the one wit the suit
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue
So called beef wit you know who
Fuck it he just let him kill all of our troops
Look at the bullshit we been through
Had the niggas sittin on top they roofs
Hurricane Katrina we shoulda called it Hurricane Geeoorrggiaa Bush
Then they tellin yall lies on the news
The white people smiling like everythin cool
But I know people that died in that pool
I know people that died in them schools
Now what is the survivor to do
Got to no trailer you gotta move
Now its on to Texas and to Geeoorrggiiaa
They tell you what they want show you what they want you to see
But they dont let you know whats really goin on
Make it look like a lotta stealin goin on
Boy them cops is killas in my home
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I aint no thief Im just tryin to eat
Man fuck the police and president Geeoorrrggiiaa Bush
So what happened to the leverage why wasnt they steady
Why wasnt they able to control this
I know some fok that live by the lever
That keep on tellin me they heard this stole this
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy
1965 I aint too young to know this
That was President Johnson now
But its president Geeoorrggiiaa Bush
We from a town where Georgia
Everybody died but baby Im still prayin wich ya
Aint nobody tried theres no doubt on my mind it was Georgia Bush
I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map
New Orleans baby now the white house hatin tryin to wash away like we not on the map
Wait have you heard the latest they sayin you gotta have paper if you tryin to come back
Niggas thinkin its a wrap see we cant hustle in they trap we aint from Geeoorrggiaa
Noooww its them dead bodies them lost houses the mayor say dont worry bout it
And the children have been scarred no ones here to care bout em
And fash out to all the rappers that helped out
Yea we like it they callin yall but fuck president Geeoorrggiaa Bush
We see them Confederate flags you know what it is
A white cracker muthafucka that probably voted for him
And no he aint gonna drop no dollas but he do drop bombs
RIP Tay cause he died in the storm fuck president Geeoorrggiiaa Bush
See us in ya city man give us a pound

Big money for the grill so Im never cheap talking yea

Yeaa money on my mind money money on my mental

And if a nigga disrespect me then he shall be very dead
Thats my word gotta urge to hit a nigga and swerve
And them birds in the trigger shot down to my feet

While niggas off in the neighborhood sellin With penitentiary chances
The dope roped up in a couple of pants is
Fiends flock like come get this candy
I got Heroin bundles and them Highland Os
Plus a cooked slab Chopped up Dimes is swoll
If I spot the laws comin Hey its time to roll
Candy Carter got a line of parole Outta control
The first fell on a Tuesday this month Oh
Sweet thang Plus its a sweet thing
In for three days
One time you say what u mean
Break up the block like Maurice Green
Ya feel me In my predicament

Hustle ridiculous Im trying to get this dope continuos
Ball til I fall One thing I aint tryin to fall
Want everybody numb like Ambasol
There go them fuckin PoPos UhOh
And if you know like I know UhOh

Violent on acid them gangstas doin time in emparishment
Role models Keep ya cut They drank whole bottles

You beef with me I guarantee ya mams will be missin
With a note behind demandin three chickens
Or she gets it Do not twist it
We cut ya Have ya body in three different places
Aint nothin gravy But save it
Cause Im a rider Hit a nigga street
Weezy go to war like Sudam and Clinton disagree
While Im shitty from the weed
Like where them bustas be
I promise ya never fuckin sleep I clear the set
Come outside late at night To ya surprise Im here with Tecks
Two shots knock off a niggas neck its so realistic
So I hope you get it or else them shots poke ya fifty
Be on the block til them Soldiers hit it
Me come and tear ya block up
If you dont want no problems
You better get off the corner
Ok I cook ya cut An ship an move it
I make a livin in this crooked public distrubutin
Just take a peek around Cause when blood is shootinshit is boomin
The hottest D in town
Lookin for me Have me toasted like after six
See I crack the bricks right down to Zs
Got pounds of trees My blocks blazin qps to kis
Gangin in the cheese Them bricks is comin
No drop sound sit on nothin

If I give you a dime I leave with somethin
The big dog Nigga I got the city under siege
An the law dont bother me I give the pigs a couple of Gs
Shiiit I hustle stronger pushin this work through the streets

Fuck around with them fuckarounds and you fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around with them fuckarounds and you fuck around and get smoked
I’m rollin all my niggas rollin
Keep that fuckin red bandana Hulk Hogan

I’m on a pain pill

These niggas ain’t forreal Like a fire drill
Your hoe on my back like a fuckin 5th wheel
that bitch make her pussy open and close like fish gills
I put all my niggas on but some of them niggas gone
Them niggas callin my phone leave me alone
I’m lightin up that strong then pass it to my bro
Numbers don’t lie except 50
You niggas pull down your skirts
If I die of these purp put a bad bitch in my hearse
My hoes lift up they shirts I’m high as Captain Kirk
If we run out of work we Rob like Burke
09 we tote my niggas ain’t no joke
And we keep them blows so please don’t get smoked
Fuck around with them fuckarounds and you fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around with them fuckarounds and you fuck around and get smoked
Corlay RIP him Darnell RIP him

Hella bands hella bands hit the club throwing hella bands
Heavy load throwing hella bands in the club doing the money dance
Hella bands hella bands hit the club throwing hella bands

Pistol hit his melon it ain’t gone be nothing left

And we keep them blows so please don’t get smoked
Fuck around with them fuckarounds and you fuck around and get smoked
Fuck around with them fuckarounds and you fuck around and get smoked
Runnin around with my gangstas Runnin up in these yellow hoes
Everybody wanna fuck my bitch her pussy lips like heaven doors

See I wipe a bitch down then dribble on a hoe
And I touch her from her head from her waist to her toes
Pop up in the Lexus with the mink on the floor

Its all good when we making love
All I ask is dont take our love
My love for you is real
Baby if you dont love me
So dont you ever get too comfortable

Feeling irreplaceable listening to Beyonce

And dont I treat you like souffl©
Dont I look at you like I see a new day
And dont I do what I do say
Im through talking so Im a let you Face

You talking bout leave baby you aint gone yet
And if you leave leave correct
And Im a send a jet to pick up the next
And if you leave youre leaving the best
So you would have to settle for less
I am no Elliot Ness I dont handcuff I dont arrest
I do confess to the virginsy
Cause under them sheets I am a mess
Not chess dont jump your nest
Yeah its no sweat no sweat
I will never 1 2 3 4get
About you your love your sex

We can get together never disconnect
Funny how that song hasnt got old yet to us

Yeah I pour out my heart have a drink
They say the drunk never lie they aint never lying
Yeah my country tis of thee
Sweet land of kill em all and let em die
Heard tomorrow aint promised today
The end of time is like a hour away
Damn military minded lost it cant find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was looking for me Ima hide by abroad
Shooting stars in my pocket bitch sit on my rocket
Im wired off a socket but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If theres food for thought then Im guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want I took heed yeah
Back to life back to reality
Been eating my girl and shes so sweet got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But whats appealing to me is under banana trees Lord
I go so hard I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Aint that a bitch Im just a nut tryna bust a nut in the nut shell
Used to say fuck the police now I say fuck jail
Uh same shit different air freshener
I dont play boy I aint Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head pow peace of mind
I be in a cloud cloud number 9
And I just fucked a clock and let it cum in time
Its a cold world I put on a mink
Theres a chain of commands Im the missing link
I heard tomorrow aint promised today
And Im smoking on them flowers catch the bouquet
And we live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was looking for me Ima hide by abroad
Shooting stars in my pocket bitch sit on my rocket
Im wired off a socket but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead

Say the judge or the jury cant spoil this Na ahn ahn
Nah two thirds of the worlds most loyalest
Imma shoot emImma pay the bail Im sure of this
Imma kill em Imma get the witness teach em more of this
We never sing not even on a song where the choruses
Dig the hole get the wood box bring the florist in
Tell the pastor tell the family we was just warning them
38s 45s all type of Tauruses
About to hit the bong pour the Holy water in
Celebrating for participating in the slaughtering
Eating steaks at the same spot they killed Paulie in
Frank Whites three in the quarter taping your daughter in
Columbia with the connect putting the order in
Nigga act we gonna clap like we the audience
Make sure you aint down to strap get rid of all the prints
Do your homework on whoever you go to war against
I had 20s on my Benz lend it to all my friends
And everything was all gravy everything was all gravy
And if I need something call Baby I need something call Baby
And the streets was calling me but a nigga had call waiting
And yeah we all went through our phases we all went through our savings
Some niggas stayed on point some niggas was point shaving
And sometimes we had to be vegetables
That mean we had to stay patient cause they say you are what you eat
I took the star out of starvation bitch
I come from a Third World start rapping in the fourth grade
Start trapping in the sixth grade went platinum in the tenth grade
Dropped out a nigga getting paid this when Birdman had a fade
This when Hummers didnt come stretch but Birdman had em made
This when pretty bitches set you up and niggas didnt give two fucks
You had two guns and two phones you could waste time and get a new cup
But this when niggas had pimp cups and new rappers got hemmed up
And all them niggas thats biting got they fins cut
I know real niggas gon fuck with this
Like thats that shit I be talkin bout
I know real niggas gon fuck with this
Like thats that shit I be talkin bout
And we gon be around till yo motherfuckin body rot
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got
But this when niggas had pimp cups and dirty money got rinsed up
And the early birds in the worm hole would get so fat that theyd get stuck
Wed clean our fingerprints up wed clean the shit we didnt touch
This when niggas called Diddy Puff
Letting Biggie bump while Im sitting up in that big body
I can show you a dead body
Lotta niggas got pinched and the snitches ended up dead lobsters
Wrap the birds in red tape call them bitches Red Robins
Pops had kilos I needed one key I wouldve made copies
Free my niggas down and Rest In Peace to all my dead partners
I smoke bout a pound in like a week and fuck the Weight Watchers
Got my self a brand new triple beam just to weigh options
I stumbled upon a gold mine I thank God that it aint copper
Some niggas were late bloomers but boy look how theyve blossomed
Dont know niggas that wear wires but I know niggas that go haywire
I know hoes that play possum and will bring us to yall mailboxes
And dead man cant talk and the Feds dont have séances
Look you put a knot on the end of a condom full of drugs and put it in her pussy
And get through customs cause last time we just took em
I rather be blind before I be the nigga that stand around just lookin
And you can beat around the bush and find a nigga laying behind them bushes
I know real niggas gon fuck with this
Like thats that shit I be talkin bout
I know real niggas gon fuck with this
Like thats that shit I be talkin bout
And we gon be around till yo motherfuckin body rot
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got
And if the Feds bring us in we get the same time Gotti got

You know Ive been talking shit for a generation now
Its about that time for me to kick my feet up
Move on to other indevours
Whos read to take the torch
Havent I taught you anything
When this shit dropped I was about 16
Trynna get some head from a mixed thing
Say goodbye to ripped jeans
Worse fear was gettin robbed
For my last 50 dollars that I had left over
5 dollars and they pop a nigga in his left shoulder
13s on my whip kept my shit clean
Actually that was my mommas shit
but i driving around down on my Obama shit
Just to get a tank of gas
Hadda run the guns up the street and pawn the shit
But yeah I headed for a scholarship
Little scrap game but i gotta alotta lip
Thats why those niggas dont like me
And always wanna fight me
A dumb nigga hate a smart mouth most likely
I know the game Im a expert
Nigga How you gonna jump me if my legs work
Showed up at her crib trynna bone
And I fucked yet cause her momma always home
Please God Dont let this little broad have herpes
My niggas say she fast like jackies on a curb street
Gold medals if we gave hoes medals
No rose pettles on the bed in the ghettos
Gotta sing for a set of thoses
Tall white Ts cant believe we used to wear those
White folks looking at us like we weirdos
But we was only kiddos
Grabbin titties in the club
Trynna get the kitty was like trynna solve a riddle
Trynna get the diddy cause I murder instrumentals
Thats that good ol fashion Mark Jackson
Fucked and I passed now you all Utah Jazzin
I dont play nigga I Mark Madison
Thats why my knots stick like a fuckin Kardasian
Im not asking my nigga I dont need favors
Im in the streets with the fiends
Ive done and seen danger
Im in the green range
Nigga Im the green ranger
I fucking ran outta breathe
Im in the green range
Nigga Im the green ranger
I dont even like this beat
But fuck it Im only gonna spit a few bars cause I dont like this beat
Bitch Im not old news
Im more like Gold Shoes
She eat my whole dick
She like whole foods
They say Im old school
At a cops house
They throwing up them bricks
My niggas got enough life
I got my draws on Sam Rastein
44 on my waist Rick Ross Jeans
Ive been faded Stonewashed jeans
New pussy new money New Orleans
50 up in the Uzi
I merk you with that bitch scratch the serial number and reuse it
Stretch niggas out like limos
Zit Zit Zit Zit Zit

Hahahahaha Red Bow BEEOUTCHLyrics submitted by Derek
What were you gonna do
Kill me in my sleep u bitch ass nigga
Tupac Biggie shut the fuck up
Fucking dogs they barking shit
Dont shoot me Dont shoot me
And Im grindin until Im tired
And you aint grindin until you tired
So Im grinding with my eyes wide
A way through the day
The life of the night
Dear lord youve take so many of my people
Im just wondering why you havent taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right
Take me away from the hood
Take me away from the hood
in a casket or a Bentley
Like I overdosed on cocaine
like a bullet from Kurt Cobain
Im from a windy city
From a block close to
shot for no fucking reason
And you wonder why Kanye
and Game hes the equal
Passion Of The Christ need a sequel
Yeah like Rockefeller need a Segal
Like I needed my father
but he needed a needle
so I can lead my people
Why did John Lennon leave the Beetles
And Why every hood nigga
Answer my question before this
bullet leave this Desert Eagle
And Im grindin until Im tired
And you aint grindin until you tired
So Im grinding with my eyes wide
A way through the day
The life of the night
Dear lord youve take so many of my people
Im just wondering why you havent taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right
We are not the same
So approach my Phantom doors with caution
You see them 24s spinnin
And all the pictures of me an M I burned them
So it aint no proof that I ever walked through 8 Mile
So they aint no proof I ever walked through 8 mile
and since their aint no proof I never walked through 8 mile
Sometimes I think about my life with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn I know his mama proud
and since you helped me sell my dream
we can share my mama now
And like MJB no more drama now
me and Common on common ground
and niggas could drive it outta town
Got a Chris Paul mind state
Im never out of bounds
My life use to be empty
like a Glock without a round
like a chopper with a thousand rounds
And Im grindin until Im tired
And you aint grindin until you tired
So Im grinding with my eyes wide
A way through the day
The life of the night
Dear lord youve take so many of my people
Im just wondering why you havent taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right
Walked through the gates of hell
see my Impala parked in front
with the high beams on
Listening to The Chronic album
Shootin at pictures of Don Imus
My mind fucked up so I
cover it with a Raider hood
Im from the city that made you
Made my Grandmother pray for good
and never made her happy
but I bet that new Mercedes could
Aint no bars but niggas cant
They took so many of my niggas
that I should hate the hood
But its real niggas like me
Ridin slow in that Phantom
just the way I should
the nigga Alvo couldnt stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
Id still keep this motherfucker cocked back
And Im grindin until Im tired
And you aint grindin until you tired
So Im grinding with my eyes wide
A way through the day
The life of the night
Dear lord youve take so many of my people
Im just wondering why you havent taken my life
Like what the hell am I doing right

I’m grindin’ I’m grindin’ I’m grindin’ I promise

My girl like it rough she said “find me a diamond” about to be grindin’
Lord we be on every kind of narcotic that make us believe we lyin’ we honest
I love you we honest I love you
Pick Michael Jackson to Jordan to Tyson to Myers
Too much dirty money when the colors are washing the whites in the dryer my nigga
It ain’t rocket science just rockets I sleep in pussy not pajamas grindin’
I got this shit down to a science I turn in my project A minus
Whew I ain’t crazy I’m krazy and all of my niggas chaotic
Trusting our back like they got the music too loud to hear sirens
We pop pop pop where you stay knock knock knock anyone home
Pop pop pop pop then we outtie I need a bitch like Naomi
To take off her clothes like Lalani for niggas that’s grindin’
Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Yeah I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I put time into all this shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I think I got it bitch
I’m grindin’ for all my shit

Yo bitch fucking anonymous niggas

Cause these hoes seeing all of my niggas
Cause what’s the hottest shit on these corners
That’s me and all my niggas
Grind for all this shit I ain’t ever fall for that bitch
Cause picking up the feather from a lovebird is like a medicine ball to that bitch
We will bring Gucci bag in this bitch and you know it stacks in that bitch
These niggas walk around with they chests out like Janet Jackson and shit
I’m sweatin’ grindin’ this bitch I need a shrine in this bitch
Fuck double O seven I work twentyfour seven ain’t got time to bond with no bitch
Heard JayZ got a new Cognac where to find that shit
And we stick and grind that shit where I got it from Nevermind that shit
Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit

I got a new vision for all my shit I don’t know what to call that shit
I know I’m selling all of my cars I’m selling selling all of my watches I’m selling diamonds and all of that shit
Realized I don’t need that shit I’m a different breed with this shit
I’m tryna turn M’s to B’s in this bitch and I ain’t ever pay to be with no bitch
I I I want that Bridget Bardot hanging over my bed fifty mill in one room
You you could ask anyone out here who running the game and they’ll tell you the truth
Man I tell ya oh look they fuck with me now I think they’re hearin’ me now
Someone said “Nigga they takin’ you seriously now”
I’m like “I think they might just be scared of me now”
But it’s all good niggas wrong every day niggas wrong every day
Goin’ to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe we ain’t ever have to play it safe
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I’m runnin’ out of space
Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Yeah I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I put time into all this shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I think I got it bitch
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I would rather step it up and put it in the safe then peek inside the safe and say I’m running out of space believe that
Tell them niggas cool out
Cause it can be a mothafucking shootout
Kidnap a nigga beat the truth out
Moms pick the suit out
Top floor window he get threw out
Flying out the crew out
They flew out invite them to my new house my new house
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house
I’m fucking every night up in my new house
Cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house
One big room full of bad bitches x8
Fu got the weed Marl got the gun
They say numbers don’t lie
Bitch I’m not the one
Hammers in ya face this is not a dream
And you get in every page in this magazine
Bumping UGK talking about a murder
We roll a Dr Jay and then we light that Julius Erving
I got pussy on the way and pussy on the way out
Life is a beach and these hoes trying to lay out
Tunechi Tunechi tote the tooly
Fuck around and pop ya
My homies got that white girl
Glock for Tini nina colada
I’m going at your collar
Weezy go hard you bitches go figure
Diamonds in my teeth like I’m a fucking dope dealer
You’re a dead man walking Michael Jackson Thriller
I’m in one big room full of bad bitches
I’m in one big room full of bad bitches
tote the tooly fuck around and pop ya
My homies got that white girl
tote the tooly fuck around and pop ya
Back where I started on my set in black
All chrome Glock looking like a platinum plaque
We don’t pack extra clips we pack extra Gats
And all my hoes dirty like welcome mats
Til the wheels fall off I can fix a flat
If you’re scared go to church and get a scripture tat
Guns the size of children now don’t be childish
Be with wildass niggas and I am the wildest
I’m a motherfucker call me Weezy baby
And on the end of the barrel I got a sweet potato
My life is a movie I got a leading lady
My rooftop drop back like Tom Brady
I got the world in my hands skateboard n’ my vans
And all my boys stay strapped like we live in Iran
I know what I can do so bitch I do what I can
Drop that Sorry 4 the Wait man

Help you know I need someone
Help you know I need someone
So sick need a doc yes
A creature monster like the lockness
I gets hotter by the toc when I sizzle to death
I just tell the clock give me a sec
In the middle of the war where my enemy at
Im running this shit like Eric B enemy back
Cause everytime I hit a track Im like an energy pack
The instruments are crying out where the sympathy at
I attack before you begin to react
Im from the dirt where the Beatles and John Lennon be at
And now these niggas looking yellow like a penalty flag
Its Weezy baby with this hustle until infinity ya
Like somebody let the dog out the kinnle and ran
Whoever did it was a very smart women or man
Cause Im coming like the stomp of every marching band
I need yall to arch your hands and pray for me
Help you know I need someone
Help you know I need someone

feat Smoke from Field Mob
TPain Smoke Chorus
And you if give a fuck that your friends stuck up
and she dont wanna mess up her hair
and if you wanna fuck like I wanna fuck
put your muthafucking hands in the air
Im on 5 hour energy Nuvo and Hennessy
so what you wanna do little baby
Now all my ladies in the house say hoe
And all my hoes in the house say lady
I never quit a bitch noooo
no matter how many niggas hit
or how many dick she licked
I give her a kiss and shit
when other niggas dont stay long enough they
get the digits and split
if aint nobody telling you that you are pretty
thats just because you are and they do not want to admit it
look at all that ass you aint got to have titties
at least you part of the itty bitty committee really
you gon let em style on you
or you can let em talk
hop up in this Lamborghini baby go on let em walk
stop hanging round them stupid bitches youd be better off
them hoes dirty birds Atlanta Hawks
go on wear them granny draws
matter of fact go put that dress on and dont wear any draws and come sit on Santa Claus
we can take some pictures with the islands in the back drop
we can go to PC but youll still be my laptop
Kiss her on the thigh make her pussy hole cry
they say numbers dont lie lets try 69
kiss her on her lips let her pussy hole drip
she cant even walk to the bathroom she gotta skip
kiss her on her cheek make her pussy lips speak
no she pulling on my locks kiss thou Sheek ha
kiss her on her breasts east and west
and then I go south
and clean up my mess
no stop signs no red lights
she put on a show no stage fright
and then I fuck her right
and she say fucking right
she climb on top that mountain
and ride that mountain bike
she keep it nice and wet like Armour All
she keep a close shave like Barber Saul
but all in all shes just Weezy baby

But I cant be with you
Tomorrow Ill be back up on the first flight
right up out of town

Whos on the other line
I done got so high
oh oh oeh oh oh eh eh

Girl I gotta drop your ass off

Girl I gotta take off
Cause imma be here next week

Cause she say Wayne Wayne
So she got me all impatient
I can hear my conscious
Boy you got a problem
and you aint foolin no one
Your like a hot revolver
But you aint killin no one
and so shes gone to party town
And you go by yourself
I told her I can be with her
But I cant be with her
As much as she like me to
She like me too much
and when I say I got to leave
and all of the things
shell say to make me stay
I been that boy for forever
But she wanna go with me to outer space
So we made love in the Milky Way
then I send her on her way
Boy you got a problem
and you aint foolin no one
Your like a hot revolver
But you aint killin no one
And so shes gone to party town
And you go by yourself
so all aloneLyrics submitted by Brody
