I was born in a thunderstorm
Im playing on my own
I wanted everything I never had
Like the love that comes with light
I wore envy and I hated that
I had a oneway ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind dont change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
And youre taught to cry in your pillow
I found solace in the strangest place
Way in the back of my mind
I saw my life in a strangers face
I had a oneway ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind dont change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
And youre taught to cry in your pillow
You took it all but Im still breathing
I had made every single mistake
That you could ever possibly make
I took and I took and I took what you gave
But you never noticed that I was in pain
I knew what I wanted I went in and got it
Did all the things that you said that I wouldnt
I told you that I would never be forgotten
I know thats part of you
Im alive You took it out but Im still breathing
You took it out but Im still breathing
Im alive You took it out but Im still breathing
You took it out but Im still breathing
Im alive You took it out but Im still breathing
You took it out but Im still breathing
Deep sea of pearl diving
You turned into another man
Youre a stranger to me
Youre a danger to me
You turned into another man
Youre a stranger to me
Youre a danger to me

Tough girl in the fast lane
No time for love no time for hate
No drama no time for games
Tough girl whose soul aches
Im at home on my own
Check my phone nothing though
Act busy order in pay TV
I may cry ruining my makeup
Wash away all the things youve taken
I dont care if I dont look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
Tough girl Im in pain
Its lonely at the top
I still pour you a glass of champagne
Tough girl whose soul aches
Im at home on my own
Check my phone nothing though
Act busy order in pay TV
I may cry ruining my makeup
Wash away all the things youve taken
I dont care if I dont look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
I wake up I wake up
I wake up I wake up
I wake up I wake up
I wake up I wake up
I wake up I wake up
I wake up I wake up
I may cry ruining my makeup
Wash away all the things youve taken
I dont care if I dont look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
Clipped wings I was a broken thing
Had a voice had a voice but I could not sing
You would wind me down
I struggled on the ground
So lost the line had been crossed
Had a voice had a voice but I could not talk
I struggle to fly now
But theres a scream inside that we are frightened
We hold on so tight we cannot deny
Eats us alive oh it eats us alive
Yes theres a scream inside that we are frightened
We hold on so tight but I dont wanna die no
I dont wanna die I dont wanna die
Im not gon care if I sing off key
I find myself in my melodies
I sing for love I sing for me
I shout it out like a bird set free
No I dont care if I sing off key
I find myself in my melodies
I sing for love I sing for me
Ill shout it out like a bird set free
Ill shout it out like a bird set free
Ill shout it out like a bird set free
Now I fly hit the high notes
I have a voice have a voice hear me roar tonight
But I fought back loud
But theres a scream inside that we are frightened
We hold on so tight we cannot deny
Eats us alive oh it eats us alive
Yes theres a scream inside that we are frightened
We hold on so tight but I dont wanna die no
I dont wanna die I dont wanna die
Im not gon care if I sing off key
I find myself in my melodies
I sing for love I sing for me
I shout it out like a bird set free
No I dont care if I sing off key
I find myself in my melodies
I sing for love I sing for me
Ill shout it out like a bird set free
Ill shout it out like a bird set free
Ill shout it out like a bird set free
Ill shout it out like a bird set free
Ill shout it out like a bird set free
Ill shout it out like a bird set free
Help I have done it again
Ive have been here many times before
And the worst part is theres no one else to blame
Be my friend hold me
Wrap me up unfold me
Warm me up and breathe me
Ouch I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah I think that I might break
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe
Be my friend hold me

Youre dark grey like a storm cloud
Swelling up with rain that is desperate to be let out
And I know it’s a heavy load carrying those tears around
Worry makes the world go round
Youre twisted up like a slipknot
Tied by a juice head who just took his Tshirt
And I know theres a hungry dog
Tugging at your frayed ends
But he’s just playing with you he just wants to be your friend
So don’t worry don’t worry
I’m here by your side
By your side by your side
Yesterday is gone and you will be OK
Place your past into a book
Burning pages let them cook
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today
Place your past into a book
Burning pages let them cook
Eyes stinging from the black smoke
All is well we welcome the cry of the dark night sky
Swallow me peacefully follow my heart back inside
So don’t worry don’t worry
I’m here by your side
By your side by your side
Yesterday is gone and you will be OK
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages let them cook
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today
Place your place into a book
Burn the pages let them cook
I’m here by your side
By your side by your side
Yesterday is gone and you will be OK
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages let them cook
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages let them cook

All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
Ive been for a walk on a winters day
Id be safe and warm if I was in LA
California dreamin on such a winters day
I stopped into a church I passed along the way
Well I got down on my knees and I pretended to pray
You know the preacher liked the cold he knows Im gonna stay
California dreamin on such a winters day
Id be safe and warm
Id be safe and warm
Id be safe and warm
Id be safe and warm
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
Ive been for a walk on a winters day
If I didnt go I could leave today
California dreamin on such a winters day
Oh such a winters day
On such a winters day
Look at me I’m such a basket case
Delivered to you wrapped in cellophane
Waiting on your doorstep out your day
Delivery a basket filled with pain
Patience is your virtue saint o’ mine
I’d have fallen through the cracks without your love tonight
I’m your groundhog and Im skating on thin ice
But you see me at your feet and carry me inside
Eh eh eh eh
Eh eh eh eh
Oh cant you see I’m wrapped in cellophane
Watch the blood pump through my veins
Electricity floods my brain
Can’t hide the pain
Can’t hide the pain
When you’re wrapped in cellophane
Look at me I’m such a basket case
While I fall apart you hide all my pills again
And all the things I need to hear you say
You’ll watch as all my thoughts get right back on the train
Eh eh eh eh
Eh eh eh eh
Oh cant you see I’m wrapped in cellophane
Watch the blood pump through my veins
Electricity floods my brain
Can’t hide the pain
Can’t hide the pain
When you’re wrapped in cellophane
Cant you see I’m wrapped in cellophane
Watch the blood pump through my veins
Electricity floods my brain
Can’t hide the pain
Can’t hide the pain
When you’re wrapped in cellophane
Party girls dont get hurt
Cant feel anything when will I learn
I push it down push it down
Im the one for a good time call
Phones blowin up theyre ringin my doorbell
I feel the love feel the love
Im gonna swing from the chandelier
Im gonna live like tomorrow doesnt exist
Im gonna fly like a bird through the night
feel my tears as they dry
Im gonna swing from the chandelier
And Im holding on for dear life
wont look down wont open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
cause Im just holding on for tonight
Help me Im holding on for dear life
wont look down wont open my eyes
Keep my glass full until morning light
cause Im just holding on for tonight
Sun is up Im a mess
Gotta get out now
Here comes the shame
Throw em back till I lose count
Im gonna swing from the chandelier
Im gonna live like tomorrow doesnt exist
Im gonna fly like a bird through the night
feel my tears as they dry
Im gonna swing from the chandelier
And Im holding on for dear life

Death by chocolate is myth
This I know because I lived
Ive been around for broken hearts and how
Lay your head in my hands little girl
This is only right now
Death by crying doesnt exist though
The headaches feel a bit like it
But you reach the end of the road
Im certain you will grow
Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn
Just how to love again
Let your leaves fall and return
Oh darling the seasons are your friend
Death by anger this is true
Just let him go he cant hurt you
Oh little girl this is such a cruel cruel world
This is the first of a million broken hearts
Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn
Just how to love again
Let your leaves fall and return
Oh darling the seasons are your friend
Oh it wont be long you will grow strong

Faint light of dawn
Im listening to you breathing in and breathing out
You are beautiful floating clouds soft world
I cant feel my lips
Im going down I dont want to change
Im going down going down the drain
Dont bring me down I beg you
Dont bring me down I wont let you

Then all of thats annulled and Im ayones everyones
Your face becomes the sun
And Im addicted to the joy that the little things
The little things they bring
Im going down I dont want to change
Im going down going down the drain
Dont bring me down I beg you
Dont bring me down I wont let you
Dont bring me down
So now for restless mind I could go either way
Im going down I dont wanna change

Dont bring me down I beg of you

I had given up
I didn’t know who to trust
So I designed a shell
Kept me from heaven and hell
And I had hit a low
Was all I let myself know
Yeah I had locked my heart
I was imprisoned by dark
You found me dressed in black
Hiding way up at the back
Life had broken my heart into pieces
You took my hand in yours
You started breaking down my walls
And you covered my heart in kisses
I thought life passed me by
Missed my tears ignored my cries
Life had broken my heart my spirit
And then you crossed my path
You quelled my fears you made me laugh
Then you covered my heart in kisses
I was down for the count
I was down I was out
And I had lost it all
Cause I was scared I was torn
And I took to the night
I’d given in to the fight
And I slipped further down
I felt like I had drowned
You found me dressed in black
Hiding way up at the back
Life had broken my heart into pieces
You took my hand in yours
You started breaking down my walls
And you covered my heart in kisses
I thought life passed me by
Missed my tears ignored my cries
Life had broken my heart my spirit
And then you crossed my path
You quelled my fears you made me laugh
Then you covered my heart in kisses
I was hopeless and broken
You opened the door for me
Yeah I was hiding and you let the light in
And now I see
That you do for the wounded
What they couldnt seem to
You set them free
Like a butterfly kissing a child with an eye for the minor key
You found me dressed in black
Hiding way up at the back
Life had broken my heart into pieces
You took my hand in yours
You started breaking down my walls
And you covered my heart in kisses
I thought life passed me by
Missed my tears ignored my cries
Life had broken my heart my spirit
And then you crossed my path
You quelled my fears you made me laugh
Then you covered my heart in kisses
Covered my heart in kisses

And another one bites the dust
Oh why can I not conquer love
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah lets be clear Ill trust no one
You did not break me
Im still fighting for peace
Well Ive got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
Im like a rubber band until you pull too hard
I may snap and I move fast
But you wont see me fall apart
Cause Ive got an elastic heart
Ive got an elastic heart
Yeah Ive got an elastic heart
And I will stay up through the night
Lets be clear wont close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
Ill walk through fire to save my life
And I want it I want my life so bad
Im doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
Its hard to lose a chosen one
You did not break me
Im still fighting for peace
Well Ive got thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade it might be too sharp
Im like a rubber band until you pull too hard
I may snap and I move fast
But you wont see me fall apart
Cause Ive got an elastic heart
Ive got an elastic heart
And the fire moves on
In my arms in my arms
And I’m left inside my hole
And your melody are my home
And I won’t let the terror in and steal them down
Through the eye of the needle
Tears fall to the beat
Smile will draw the pain
In my arms in my arms
And I’m left inside my hole
And your melody are my home
And I won’t let the terror in and steal them down
Through the eye of the needle
It’s a mine oh mine
Defy the eye of the needle
And I’m left inside my hole
And your melody are my home
And I won’t let the terror in and steal them down
Through the eye of the needle
And I’m left inside my hole
And your melody are my home
And I won’t let the terror in and steal them down
Through the eye of the needle
Cause you’re a man you’re not a boy
Youve got some power
And I can’t treat you like a toy
The road lessTraveled by a little girl
You disregard the mess
While I try to control the world
Stay here and frighten me
Come now enlighten me
Give me all you got
Give me your wallet and your watch
Give me your first born
Give me the rainbow and the
So go on and challenge me
Take the reigns and the seat
Watch me squirm baby
But you are just what I need
And Ive never played a fair game
I’ve always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and nerve if
I can’t respect any man
Yeah I want to play a fair game
Yeah I want to play a fair game
We’ve still not kissed
And yet I’ve cried
You got too close in
I pushed and pushed
So I could run run
And then I did betray the dust
You saw those teeth marks
They weren’t all yours
You had been trusted to a history
That had not worked for me
Into a history from which I could not face
So go on and shake me
Shake until I give it up
When I am in doubt baby
I know that we could make some love
So go on challenge me
Take the reigns and the seat
Watch me squirm baby
But you’re just what I need
And Ive never played a fair game
I’ve always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and nerve if
I can’t respect any man
Yeah I want to play a fair game
Yeah I want to play a fair game
And I never played a fair game
I’ve always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and nerve if
I can’t respect any man
Yeah I want to play a fair game

It’s dangerous to fall in love but I
Wanna burn with you tonight
The pleasure is pain and fire burning
Hate for love in for us why
Why dont you come dont you come a little closer
We were meant for one another
And you feel love for me
I got all I need
When you came back for me
And I can barely breathe
And youre in love with me
Like smoke darkening the sky
I’ll meet on the drive
We were meant for one another
And you feel love for me
Ive got all I need
When you came back for me
And youre in love with me
But it’s about best certain death
But I want what I want and I gotta get it
Hot ash dead match only smoke is left
It’s about best certain death
But I want what I want and I gotta get it
Hot ash dead match only smoke is left
And you feel love for me
I got all I need
When you came back for me
And youre in love with me
I love you so
Wanna throw you from the roof
Wanna put my hands through you
I’ll squeeze you tight until you take your last breath
Loving you to death
Loving you to death
The pressure’s rising I won’t make it through tonight
This love immortal is an assassins delight
Just blow me up or run me down or cut my throat
And when its time for you to die
I’ll let you know
Shoot me like a cannon ball
Kill me like an animal
Hit me like a baseball
I love you so I’m putting you in quicksand
You take your chances when you kiss the hitman
The animal’s inside of this infinite jest
Loving you to death loving you to death
The pressure’s rising I won’t make it through tonight
This love immortal is an assassins delight
Just blow me up or run me down or cut my throat
And when its time for you to die

Could never met the kind that keeps these thoughts I lie in turn out on the spot watch it all pass by
I lie here awaiting for the tears while I pass the years
I kinda seemed to move nothing more to lose waiting in the base that we used to use
I lie here awaiting for the tears while I pass the years
Its dirty like it is everythings a mess I can only save but your last kiss
I lie here awaiting for the tears while I pass the years
I cannot show my face blurred in your embrace I am controlling your taste
I lie here awaiting for the tears while I pass the years
make believe sets me free
You hold me downLyrics submitted by Daniel Salazar
You bring me to life
Then you shut me out
You keep me silent
When I should shout
You make me cry and you make me come
You are the cop and Im on the run
It all begins with just one kiss
Im held hostage by your love
Put me in cuffs
Im held hostage by your touch
This prison is rough but
I cant get enough
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs
Don’t lock me up
Don’t you wanna free us
Im held hostage by your love
Then you let me out
And I catch the sun
You give me a taste of you and no one
But you always leave
And again Im alone
This secret burns but Im imprisoned
It all begins with just one kiss
Im held hostage by your love
Put me in cuffs
Im held hostage by your touch
This prison is rough but
I cant get enough
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs
Don’t lock me up
Don’t you wanna free us
Im held hostage by your love
Of lovers who have others
You break my heart
I’m a criminal in these parts
It all begins with just one kiss
Im held hostage by your love
Put me in cuffs
Im held hostage by your touch
This prison is rough but
I cant get enough
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs
Don’t lock me up
Don’t you wanna free us
Im held hostage by your love
It all begins with just one kiss
Im held hostage by your love
Put me in cuffs
Im held hostage by your touch
This prison is rough but
I cant get enough
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs
Don’t lock me up
Don’t you wanna free us
Im held hostage by your love
Watching the sequence of sounds coming out of your mouth
But the snow is too loud
Follow the hands as they move
Trying to make out your mould
But your brain doesnt want to
Hi close the door silent cold
What have I done to you
Im one off the dirty guns
A bullet through your heart
Interpret your eyes as they die
Should I die should I now
Weve done of sanctuary laugh
Hi close the door silent cold
What have I done to you
Im one off the dirty guns
A bullet through your heart
I woke up thinking you were still here
My hands shaking with regret
Ive held this dream for such a long long time
And I wanna get up
To the rhythm of a wild to the rhythm of a wild heart
That beats that beats like a rolling drum
I saw you standing on the corner
I saw you standing on your own
And I get the feeling that its its all a dream
And I wanna get up
To the rhythm of a wild to the rhythm of a wild heart
That beats that beats like a drum
When I fall asleep I can see your face
What I lost in you I will not replace
And I could run away I could let them down
But I will remember your light
Your light it follows me in darkness
Im trying hard but I cant win
And Ive played the victim for a long long time
And I wanna grow up
From the rhythm a young from the rhythm of a younger heart
It leads just like a river runs
That night I sent over the parkway
The summers gone and Im alone
And I get the feeling that youre somewhere close
And I wanna get up
To the rhythm of your wild to the rhythm of your wild heart
It beats been beating since youve gone
When I fall asleep I can see your face
What I lost in you I will not replace
And I could run away I could let them down
When I fall asleep I can see your face
What I lost in you I will not replace
And I could run away I could let them down
And I know youre gone but still I will remember your light
And if you see me in the darkness
I hope you know Im not alone
I carry you with every breath I take
I wont let up I wont let up
Until the wind is gone
You got it in every way
And cant you see its you I am watching
I am hot for you in every way
And turn around let me see you
Wanna free you with my rhythm
I know you cant get enough
When I turn up with my rhythm

My love leave yourself behind
Beat inside me leave you blind
My love you have found peace
You were searching for release
You gave it all into the call
You took a chance and
You took the fall for us
You did it for me
Tonight you will sleep for good
You will wait for me my love
Now I am strong you gave me all
You gave all you had
And now I am home
My love leave yourself behind
Beat inside me leave you blind

You took my hand and added a plan
You gave me your heart
I asked you to dance with me
Did what you could release

You gave all you had
And now I am home

But I want you to know that Id take a million babe

Take her down from the world

But you know you lost her to dispare
Your skin burns and prickles your skin burns and prickles

Broke down thought that I would drown
Hope that Ive been found fore I hit the ground
Sun rays out the corner of my eye hey
Saw you weeping saw you creeping
Saw you sneaking in the shadows dawn
Saw you out the corner of my eye
Dont come for me today
Dont come for me today
You came to take me away
So close I was to heavens gates
But no baby no baby not today
Oh you tried to track me down
You followed me like the darkest cloud
But no baby no baby not today
Reaper Oh no baby no baby not today
Reaper Oh no baby no baby not today
So come back when Im good to go
I got drinks to drink and men to hold
I got good things to do with my life yeah
Oh I wanna dance in the open breeze
Feel the wind in my hair hear the ocean sing
I got good things to feel in my life yeah
Dont come for me today
Dont come for me today
You came to take me away
So close I was to heavens gates
But no baby no baby not today
Oh you tried to track me down
You followed me like the darkest cloud
But no baby no baby not today
Reaper Oh no baby no baby not today
Reaper Oh no baby no baby not today
Lonely float got in the way
You are the feel and knew it anyway
Take a chance it wasn’t what you know
Take my hand and don’t let go
Yeah you’ll pull through it
Yes you can do it
Yeah you’ll pull through it
Tell her on how you feel
Give her every say she needs to hear
Give your heart and say come take it
And she will see you’re a good man
Yeah you’ll pull through it
Yes you can do it
Yeah you’ll pull through it
Yes you can do it
Yeah you’ll pull through it
Put on my best dress
I wanted to impress
I put a little makeup on
Put a bow in my hair
Hoping you might take it off
Don’t know if you really care
But I’m strapped to my chair
And it ain’t cause you’re pretty
Until you saw your chance to kill
Your chance to make history
You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die
Your blade it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why Im scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry
My mascara a mess
Harsh words for your princess
Boy you and your promises
If your goal was to love
You scored an epic miss
Now youll just have memories
You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die
Your blade it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why Im scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry
Boy you draw me back in
Hungry for your bad loving
But will someone find me swinging from the rafters
From hanging on your every word
You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die
Your blade it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why Im scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry
All smiles I know what it takes to fool this town
Ill do it til the sun goes down and all through the night time
Oh yeah oh yeah Ill tell you what you wanna hear
Leave my sunglasses on while I shed a tear
Its never the right time yeah yeah
I put my armor on show you how strong how I am
I put my armor on Ill show you that I am
Im a Porsche with no brakes
Yeah I win every single game
I dont need batteries to play
Im so confident yeah Im unstoppable today
Unstoppable today Im unstoppable today
Break down only alone I will cry out now
You’ll never see what’s hiding out
Hiding out deep down yeah yeah
I know I’ve heard that to let your feelings show
Is the only way to make friendships grow
But I’m too afraid now yeah yeah
I put my armor on show you how strong how I am
I put my armor on Ill show you that I am
Im a Porsche with no brakes
Yeah I win every single game
I dont need batteries to play
Im so confident yeah Im unstoppable today
Unstoppable today Im unstoppable today
Unstoppable today Im unstoppable today
I put my armor on show you how strong how I am
I put my armor on Ill show you that I am
Im a Porsche with no brakes
Yeah I win every single game
I dont need batteries to play
Im so confident yeah Im unstoppable today
Unstoppable today Im unstoppable today
Unstoppable today Im unstoppable today
You shut me up yeah and you filled my cup oh
You sailed my boat you were my very last hope
You took my very last hope away
Oh you you will be loved by someone good
Yeah you you will be loved by somebody good
You dropped the bomb and now youre gone
I held you dear you swallowed my fears
And now Ive drunk my last beer with you
Oh you you have been loved by someone good

That the bitterness and anger left me long ago
Only sadness remains and it will pass oh oh oh
Yeah you you will be loved by somebody good
