Flo Rida I got a story to tell story to tell story to tell
There once was a man that lived in a shoe
Next to a bakery that I knew
His excuse he had a sweet tooth
Ever since the days of his youth
I love cake he said me too
Tastes so good I drive in the coupe Err day
Traffic come through err day
For some strange reason that shop never close
And everybody leave have powder on they nose
Dunk in line Betty Crocker bank row
We eatin every day go check my resume
Im blowing Mary Jane off in this 7 tre
Yea I got 20 whips close to 40 women
So I get plenty lips I love swimmin
Im shinin every day you shinin once a year
Multi millionaire I had a monster year
We own monster trucks so ya we crush yea haters
Never squashin beef got too much paper
You dont know you better look around
Poe boys the biggest crooks in town
Hood niggas like put me down
Fifty grand just to put me now
Rollin up on the good weed now
Who you hoes call and fuck me now
Baddest chicks wanna fuck me now
They screamin loud like its a damn touchdown
I could spend a hundred thousand in a day
Getting cake er day er day er day er day
Comin through yo hood in that 7 tre
Getting cake er day er day er day er day
I told yall I dont want no cake on my birthday
I want my cake er day maan er day maan
I could spend a hundred thousand in a day
Getting cake er day er day er day er day
I dont want cake on the day I was born
I want my cake like I woke up in yawn
Flo Rida fought like a cat play with yarn
Look at my stacks I hatin the thorn
Rubber bands on the hundred grand
Im in love with that cake from oven man
Im in a trap with a bakin that oven man
If you aint talkin bout your birthday
You aint probably had cake in the first place
I go hard until the block get first aid
Do my part and Poe Boy my birth place
Stallin the block like Monday Tuesday

Carol City all good in Mi A
Im on my grind I gotta have my dunk in lines
Betty Crocker on my mind everyday 365

Look at them chasin me now

Do what I want I got dollar signs

Now Im rockin clubs arenas and all the bigger venues
Everyday we ballin tippin that Phantom price
Hit the club I come out wearin all the ice

Somthin like a big song lightin it wrist came hard
And I can do it again see Flo Rida like my brother yea he my twin

Florida I got a story to tell story to tell story to tell
There once was a man that lived in a shoe
Next to a bakery that I knew
His excuse he had a sweet tooth
Ever since the days of his youth
I love cake he said me too
Tastes so good I drive in the coupe Er day
Traffic come through er day
For some strange reason that shop never close
And everybody leave have powder on they nose
Duncan Hines Entenmanns Betty Crocker bank row

I got a few Miami vices

You know how I feel

Tomorrow I might be sober
You know how I feel

Caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
I know you wanna get behind the wheel Only 1 Rida
Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Cant let go I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to japan quake losers and survivors
Norway no you didnt get my flowers
No way to sound better but the killer was a Coward
Face just showers the minute in a hour
Heard about the news all day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a limit here
Put you in the box just the presidents cigarettes
Give em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Aint worried about the killers just the young restless
Get mad coz the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You I or jealously was not oppressive
Oh no I cant stop I was Destined
Caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get depressed coz the outfit all in it
Coz the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next get a call just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Rihanna kiss you on ya neck just kill critics
Buggatti never when Im rich just god fearing
Look at me steering got the bossing staring
Mr mike caren tell his Billie Jeans
Thank EClass Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live tryna figure how your sister vanish
No cheers I know you wouldnt panic
Caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
When I need a healing I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know its all better now
When I need a healing I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know its all better now
When I need a healing I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know its all better now

Another shot of vodka you know whats in my glass

Welcome to my house
Love comes once every now
You and I know your love comes once in a lifetime
Love comes once in a lifetime
She was the neighborhood dream girl
Can look but dont touch they all wanna know us
If it aint with me then it cant be no one
When the groupies came to the show
When the money started to grow
You stayed down dont play around
Look at this girl we made now
Been around the world and I came right back for your love
Forgive me for the days and nights I was cutting up
Wanted the motions in the ocean and emotions covered up
From flashing lights in the club to magazine covered up
Fly you to Miami and cop you floor seats
And you would always tell me your heart was for me
Way before the models ripped the runway
It was us droptops speeding down the runway
I want you to know that youre special
Ill never compare you to no one
Baby cause I know that your love comes
And she was prom queen Im just a new Jack
My city tatted on my back she had my back I knew that
But I started looking for more
When they started feeling the flow
Come more than a lifetime and time dont wait for no one
Im out here like I throw ones and they dance for me
My man he warn me how my comeup might just cancel me
Now I gotta go fix that get that hit that
He flip that in that like I used to be big DADDY
Im so special she cant have another dude that woo her
I got my Bugatti but that just pickup her
That sears these years on lairs get weird
My fear is tears that smears and makeup
Dont ever make up you better wake up
I only got one life to live
And I wanna spend it with you
Love the money and the cars but listen baby
You are what I’ve been missing
if you love somebody
put a light in the air
from the hood to the stakes
fry your finger in the air
flo rida up in here

to the time when it was just me and you

Verse 1 Flo Rida
Hopped out of that house with my swagger
Hop in that with girl I got places to go
People to see time is precious
I look at my crowd and they out of control
Just like my mind where Im going
No women no shorties no nothin but clothes
No stoppin now my parolees on role
I like my jewelry thats always on gold
I know the storm is comin
my pockets keep tellin me its gonna shower
Call up my homies thats home
Then pop in the night cuz its meant to be ours
We keep a fade away shot cuz we ballin
its platinum patron that be ours
Lil mama I owe you just like the flowers
Girl you too drunk with all that and power clubs
Chorus Flo Rida Kesha
You spin my head right round right round
When you go down when you go down down
You spin my head right round right round
When you go down when you go down down
From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin my money around
Aint nothin more beautiful to be found
Its goin down down
From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin my money around
Aint nothin more beautiful to be found
Its goin down down
Verse 2 Flo Rida
Shawty must know Im not playin
My money love her like a numba one fan
Dont look at my mouth let her talk to my fans
A couple of grands I got rubber bands
My paper planes makin a dance
Get dirty all night thats part of my thing
Keep building castles thats made out of sand
Shes amazing the fire blazing
Girl wont you move a lil closer
Time to get paid its maximum wage
That body belong on a poster
Im in a daze that bottom is wavin at me
Like damn it I know you
You wanna show like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever and Ill be your roper
Chorus Flo Rida Kesha
You spin my head right round right round
When you go down when you go down down
You spin my head right round right round
When you go down when you go down down
From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin my money around
Aint nothin more beautiful to be found
Its goin down down
From the top of the pole I watch her go down
She got me throwin my money around
Aint nothin more beautiful to be found
Its goin down down
Verse 3 Flo Rida
Im feelin my money
Im out of control
Shes takin my bank roll
But Im king of the club
And Im wearin the crown
Watchin they asses go down down down down

Hey I heard you were a wild one
If I took you home
Itd be a home run
Show me how youll do
I want to shut down the club
Hey I heard you like the wild ones
I like crazy foolish stupid
Party going wild fist pumping

Blast to the roof thats how we doz it
I dont care the night she dont care we like
Almost dared the right five
Ready to get popping aint no surprise
Take me so high jumping no doubts
Said I gotta be the man
When they heading my van might check one too
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it and yall get lose lose
After bottle we all get bit and again tomorrow
Gotta break loose cause thats the motto

Hey I heard you were a wild one
If I took you home

Show me how youll do
I want shut down the club
Hey I heard you like the wild ones
Party rocker foot show stopper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Cant see me with ten binoculars
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off
Til I make that move
Somehow someway gotta raise the roof roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Oh its on like everything goes
Round up baby til the freaky show
What happens to that body its a private show
Stays right here private show
I like em untamed dont tell me how pain
Tell them this bottoms up with the champagne
My life coming harder than we hit play
Do you busy with the bail were you insane
Hey I heard you were a wild one

Show me how youll do
I want to shut down the club
Hey I heard you like the wild ones
I am a wild one
Saddle me up and lets begin

And im on the prowl
Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Gotta make sure do you have enough
Hey I heard you were a wild one
If I took you home

Show me how youll do

Hey I heard you like the wild ones
