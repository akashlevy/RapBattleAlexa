The other day seen this girl walk by the other way
I would have spoke but when I looked at her she looked the other way
Had it been another day I would have grabbed her by the hand
You don’t know who I am but see I love the way you smile
Do you got a man I’d be honored if I can walk with you for a second
I said if you ain’t got no plans
I’m trying to get to know you cause you’re the type I go to
The type I write a song and make a beat about and flow to
Anything to show you how beautiful you are
Wish I could hold you at night and every morning say hello to you
But you don’t know it yet
Maybe I’ll approach you next time and let you know exactly how I feel about you
Until then I think of how fly it would be if it were her and I
The apple of my urban eye
And next time no lie I guess I’ll try cause I
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye no lie she the apple of my eye
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye no lie she the apple of my eye
It was one week later when I her at the bus stop
Laid eyes on her and it damn near made my heart stop
Caramel skin tight jeans and some high tops
Knowing I should go and talk to her fuck it why not
I walked over but I still couldn’t do it
It was something on my mind had me tripping going trough it
See fly girls always hurt you when they kiss you
And I’m never cupid aims with his pistol
They leave wounds and they scab and they pus
Just when I was thinking that I look up and seen the bus
Come back to reality awoke out of my fantasy
That’s when I could swear she whispered come sit in the back with me
I put my eightyfive cents in and walked to the back where the only open seat was next to her
And I was extra sure until somebody sat first
Damn I guess my story got to wait until next verse
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye no lie she the apple of my eye
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye no lie she the apple of my eye
It was a hot ass bus ride in the middle of July
But she was so cool and so fresh and so fly
So this my opportunity to try and get at her
Is it cool if I sit and then a smile as a reply
I sat down and started talking to her
Careful what I say cause I ain’t want to sound awkward to her
Said I been you but I ain’t never spoke
And I figured if I try I probably choke
Then she laughed and looked at me acting like I told a joke
And said talk I been trying
And plus I always see you with him and she laughed again
But what she said next took me for a spin
I saw you on stage never thought you looked my way
Waiting for a shooting star every night of everyday
To wish for a chance to bite the apple of my eye
Forbidden juices had me
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye no lie she the apple of my eye
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye no lie she the apple of my eye
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye no lie she the apple of my eye
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye no lie she the apple of my eye
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by Lyrics submitted by georgia
If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special way above normal
and let her get away yo than this heres for ya
If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special way above normal
And let her get away yo than this heres for ya
Yo I first met her at first didnt stress it
Probably wouldnt last like the last few I messed with
Its bad when it breaks and youve got time invested
And shattered pieces of youre heart is what youre left with
Its why I touched no cuffs
No lie yo she had me arrested
And so my conscious suggested
Play a different role now
Give it a chance cause you never know
And if shes special well man you better let her know
Before you let her go
Think twice cause stress comes after the N like the letter O
Wished I wouldve kept you
So Im bitter in the rook
Wishn that I woulda took a different approach
If I had a second chance I promise to try hard
When I reminisce over you my God
If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special way above normal
And let her get away yo than this heres for ya
If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special way above normal
And let her get away yo than this heres for ya
Friend told me brody its a cold ass world
And our environment is full of cold ass girls
And they scandalous as us
As soon as one damages your trust
Never love em just chase them till you bust
If the game gets played
Than Im heartless so long I aint the one to get played
First but each time is worse than the previous
Them girls now a days do be devious
However by nature Im naive
In the right circumstance true love can be conceived
But you does how I felt but fell victim to doubt
I guess in the end I lost out
Cause without you I feel like half of me is missin
Cause I got us both into this position
But for a second chance I promise to try hard
When I reminisce over you my God
If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special way above normal
And let her get away yo than this heres for ya
If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special way above normal
And let her get away yo than this heres for yaLyrics submitted by Daniel
Take me all the way down tonight soon Ill be leaving
Break me all the way down before the night is over
What it is what it could be
Only if you comin with me
4 AM staying up past
Or however long these drugs last
Dont know why I live so fast
They be telling me to slow down
I be screaming out fuck that
I really wanna take you down
Moaning is how I wanna make you sound
Cant wait until I get you home
Fuck that I wanna take you now
Let’s do it all have a ball
Hook up tonight in the ladies room stall
Follow you there Ill let you make the call
You can text all your friends say youll see them tomorrow
She never fucked the first night until now
Faded Im drunk off the brown
Stayed up all night on the town
Act like tomorrow just doesnt exist
Time isnt real aint shit on my wrists
Let go of everything then you have bliss
Then she told me this
Take me all the way down tonight soon Ill be leaving
Break me all the way down before the night is over
You can be supreme Kate Moss tonight
Turn up in the Soho loft tonight
Do drugs take 10 shots tonight
Awesome I’m naked with Naked and Famous jeans on the floor
Live a wild life you aint seen this before
You should give brains and I mean this for sure
Thats what genius is for
Beautiful girl that I just met on tour
Another good girl that Ill probably destroy
Her life was stable until she met me
Sheltered and safe so she never gets freed
But she loves trouble shes drawn to the danger
Never goes crazy I bet I can change her
I could make her fall in love with a stranger
Switch up the pace I dont mean Danny Granger
Can’t wait until tomorrow Im fine with today
You pretty as fuck and Im tryna slay
Lets do this right now is what Im trying to say
I can tell you dont love him youre dying to stray
I do not give a fuck bout your ex
Im not looking for love Im just looking for sex
Tension between us had me feeling vexed
Then she sent me a text
Take me all the way down tonight soon Ill be leaving
Break me all the way down before the night is over
Thats that endless summer never going back to school
We do what we want to cant tell me no rules
Every night on the town going out all the time
And Im tryna take you down only thing on my mind
Take me all the way down soon Ill be leavingLyrics submitted by Samantha

Rapper working in the business wait I never thought of that

And get faded and pass out on floors

Cause you square motherfuckers cant mess with my crew
Your bitch on my dick and her lesbian boo
They kiss on the dick I caress on the boobs

Fat boy talking out of turn
My brothers leave you sleeping in an urn
Yeah Ive had a lotta sex

Im counting so much paper until my fuckin fingers hurt
Swear its deaded off to be so hurry bring a hearse
Holler at my at my manager its taken for reverse

Dont come around my presence with your mothers empty purse
Gotta lotta lotta lotta that
Gotta lotta lotta lotta that
Gotta lotta lotta lotta that
Gotta lotta lotta lotta that
Gotta lotta lotta lotta that
Gotta lotta lotta lotta that
Gotta lotta lotta lotta that
Gotta lotta lotta lotta that
Cause Im in love with these Tumblr girls with skinny waists and drug habits
Pretty faces love status she acts as if shes the baddest
Man I swear shes just like tons of girls she expects the free drinks
And Im successful she thinks always comes around when weed stinks
We fuck off and on off and on only ever really fuck off and on
Never see her these days cause Im often gone
When Im home off tour never stop for long
Back this week from across the pond
Noticed I was close to the block shes on elevator to the floor her loft is on
Drinking whiskey she likes vodka strong
But after we fuck its over walked out the door thats closure
No I cant stay here and hold her tomorrow act like I dont know her
Wouldnt ever be here sober cant tell which one is colder
My clothings on we both did wrong I gotta go thats what I told her
She said she cant feel her face right now I cant feel my heart
For your feelings theres no place but you knew that from the start
You and I were made of glass wed never last x2
Meant to die we moved fast and then we crashed
You and I were made of glass wed never last
Shes fine as fuck and she knows it sexy body she shows it
Loves the drama she chose it she draws the line then she blows it
The most fun I suppose it pops a bottle wont close it
Fills a fifth then she throws it she pops a bar now shes dozing
Shes hot and cold hot and cold homie I dont know shes hot and cold
Truly the bullshit has gotten old superficial with a rotten soul
Fucking off and on always stop and go
Probably got someone choose not to know
Head to her place then we lock the door
Making bad calls when Im off the blow
Cause shes a bitch Im selfish want every girl cant help it
And its tough for me to shelf it its you I see myself with
Right now I know you felt it I touched her then she melted
We shouldnt chill but we do it still gotta play the hand if you dealt it
She said she cant feel her face right now I cant feel my heart
For your feelings theres no place but you knew that from the start
You and I were made of glass wed never last x2
Meant to die we moved fast and then we crashed
You and I were made of glass wed never last
Missing everything you say its not important what you stand for
Youre asking will he be the one Ill be gone before youre done tonight
Waiting for another day youre not getting what you paid for
Trying to salvage whats undone and deny you got outrun tonight
Never knew her name theyre looking all the same to me
They only chase the fame theres no one left to blame but meLyrics submitted by Samantha
