Man I promise shes so self conscious
She has no idea what shes doing in college
That major that she majored in dont make no money
But she wont drop out her parents will look at her funny
Now tell me that aint insecurrre
The concept of school seems so securrre
Sophmore three yearrrs aint picked a careerrr
She like fuck it Ill just stay down herre and do hair
Cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy dont really care
Shes so precious with the peer pressure
Couldnt afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus a Lexus
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you cant believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well
Chorus repeat 2x w Kanye adlibs
Man I promise Im so self conscious
Thats why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy
I cant even pronounce nothing pass that versace
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you aint up on this
And I cant even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper look how low we astoop
Even if you in a Benz you still a nigga in a coopcoupe
Chorus repeat 2x w Kanye adlibs
I say fuck the police thats how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail but we cant buy freedom
Well buy a lot of clothes when we dont really need em
Things we buy to cover up whats inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
Thats why shortys hollering where the ballas at
Drug dealer buy Jordans crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I aint even gon act holier than thou
Cause fuck it I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and Id do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like its all terrific
I got a couple past due bills I wont get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious Im just the first to admit it

Life of a Don lights keep glowin

Ha Ha Hum heres another hit Barry Bonds
Fresh off the plane konitchiwa bitches
Turn around another plane my passport on pivot
As for what I did it that asshole done did it
Talked it and he lived it spitted then he shitted
I dont need to write hits I might bounce ideas
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
Ive been a very good sport havent I this year
They said hes going crazy and we seen this before
But Im doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And Im doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga please how you gonna say I aint no lowhead
Cos my Dior got me more model head
And bow so hard till your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top 5 MCs you aint gotta remind me
Top 5 MCs you gotta rewind me
Im high up on the line you can get behind me
But my heads so big you cant sit behind me
Life of a Don lights keep glowin
Comin in the club wit that fresh shit on with something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum heres another hit Barry Bonds
Yeah Yeah We outta here baby
Wha Wha We outta here baby
And Mr West is so outta here baby

Im so bright not shady
My teeth and my eyes so wight like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
I’m so fucking good like I’m sleeping with Megan
I’m all about my franklins Lincolns and Reagans
Whenever they make them I shall hayve them
Oops I meant have them Im so crazy
But if you play crazy you be sleeping with daisies
Its such a hayvic oops I meant havoc
And my drinks still pinker than the easter rabbit
And Im still cold cole like Keishas family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties
And I ate it cos Im so at it
I dont front and I dont go backwards
and I dont lack shit
And you can get Barried

My big brother was BIGs brother
Use to be Dame and Biggs brother
Who was Hip Hop brother who was No ID friend
No ID my mentor now let the story begin
Its the Hard Knock Life Tour sellout picture
us in the mall coppin Iceberg and yell out Jigga
Yeah thats what well yell out yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell bout
JAY and Ye so shy
Now he wont even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind He could change yo life
With all these beats I did at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the Chig
But he got me out me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib
Big brother was BIGs brother
Use to be Dame and Biggs brother
Who was Hip Hop brother who was No ID friend
No ID my mentor now let the story begin
Begin let the story begin story begin
If you feel the way I feel
Why dont you wave your hands hands
Fresh off the plane Im off to Baseline
Nothin handed out Im bout to take mine
Round the same time of that Blueprint one
And these beats in my pocket was that Blueprint forum
Id play my little songs in that old back room
Hell bob his head and say Damn Oh thats you
But by the Black Album I was blacking out
Partyin SOBs and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And Im like Yeah yeah we gon be there but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Colleen told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin a little different
And kept little brother at bay at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess Ill understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now Im on the top and everybody on the scrotum
My big brother was BIGs brother
Use to be Dame and Biggs brother
Who was Hip Hop brother who was No ID friend
No ID my mentor now let the story begin
Begin let the story begin begin
If you feel the way I feel
Why wont you wave your hands
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
Not only a client the Presidito
The game gettin foul so heres a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped Jesus Walks now Im on the steephole
And we know New Jack City got to keep my brother
But to be number one Ima beat my brother
On that Diamonds remix I swore I was fast
Then my big brother came thru and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin me
At the Grammys I said I inspired me
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pickandroll
Cuz even if he gave me the rock its giveandgo
I guess Beanies style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gon mingle yo
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind Im like Damn no way
Translate espanol No way Jose
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known THAT was gon come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and thats what made shit worse
My big brother was BIGs brother
So heres a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on head tell em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell em
A idol in my eyes god of the game
Heart of the city RocAFella chain
Never be the same never be another
Number one Young Hov also my big brother
My big brother was BIGs brother
Use to be Dame and Biggs brother
Who was Hip Hop brother who was No ID friend
No ID my mentor and thats where the story ends
Toomp killed this shitLyrics submitted by Maliq

They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking
Fuck every question you asking
If I dont get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Four in the morning and Im zoning

Baby we living in the moment
Ive been a menace for the longest
But I aint finished Im devoted
And you know it and you know it
So follow me up cause this shit bout to go down
Im doing 500 Im outta control now
But theres nowhere to go now
And theres no way to slow down
If I knew what I knew in the past
I wouldve been blacked out on your ass
Four in the morning and Im zoning
They say Im possessed its an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches where the Trojans
Baby we living in the moment
Ive been a menace for the longest
But I aint finished Im devoted

Wait til I get my money right
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I told God Id be back in a second
Man its so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure under more scrutiny
And what I do Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry more Louis V
My momma couldnt get through to me
The drama people suing me
Im on TV talkin like its just you and me
Im just saying how I feel man
I aint one of the Cosbys I aint go to Hill man
I guess the money should have changed him
I guess I should have forgot where I came from
Wait til I get my money right
Then you cant tell me nothing right
Excuse me Was you saying something
Uh uh you cant tell me nothing
You cant tell me nothing
Uh uh you cant tell me nothing
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homey you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldnt tell you who the side was
So I parallel double park that mother sideways
Old folks talking bout back in my day
But homey this is my day class started two hours ago
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Dont ever fix your lips like collagen
And then say something where you gonna end up apologin
Let me know if its a problem man
Wait til I get my money right
Then you cant tell me nothing right
Excuse me Was you saying something
Uh uh you cant tell me nothing
You cant tell me nothing
Uh uh you cant tell me nothing
Let that man get cash
Let that man get passed
He dont even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes cause
How he move in a room full of nos
How he stay faithful in a room full of
Must be the Pharaohs he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Life is a uh dependin how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada Adam Eve wear Nada
Im in between but way more fresher
Cause when you try hard is when you die hard
Yall homies lookin like why God
When they reminisce over you my God
Wait til I get my money right
Then you cant tell me nothing right
Excuse me Was you saying something
Uh uh you cant tell me nothing
You cant tell me nothing
Uh uh you cant tell me nothing
Wait til I get my money right

That you were a champion
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil somethin show you how we live
Everybody want it but it aint that serious
Mhmmm thats that shit
So if you gon do it do it just like this
That you were a champion
You dont see just how wild the crowd is
You dont see just how fly my style is
I dont see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak italian
I dont know I just want it better for my kids
And I aint sayin we was from the projects
But everytime I wanna layaway or deposit
My dadll say when you see clothes close your eyelids
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son
In the movie I aint talkin bout the rich ones
Hell get some brand new harebrain scheme to get rich from
And I dont know what he did for dough
But hell send me back to school with a new wardrobe
and ay ay ay ay
That you were a champion
I think he did
When he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil somethin show you how we live
Everything I wanted man it seemed so serious
Mhmmm thats that shit
So if you gon do it do it just like this
That you were a champion
When it feel like livings harder than dying
For me giving ups way harder than trying
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion
I wish her heart still was in rhyming
Cuz who the kids gon listen to
I guess me if it isnt you
Last week I payed a visit to the Institute
They got the Dropout keepin kids in the school
I guess i cleaned up my act like prison do
If not for pledge at least for the principle
They got the CD they got to see me
Drop gems like i droped out of PE
They used to feel invisible
Now they now they invincible
That you were a champion
This is the story of a champion
runners on their mark and they pop their guns
Stand up stand up here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number 1
Tell me what it takes to be number 1
This is the story of a champion
runners on their mark and they pop their guns
Stand up stand up here he comes
Tell me what it takes to be number 1
Tell me what it takes to be number 1
That you were a champion

My crew deeper than Wu Tang

You ain’t fuckin’ with my clique
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival the unamerican idols
When niggas did in Paris got em hanging off the Eiffel
I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach
Think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know white people get money don’t spend it
Or maybe they get money buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ig’nant
I know Spike Lee gon kill me but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment we living no limits
Them gold master p ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination MTV cribs
Now I’m looking at a crib right next to where TC lives
That’s Tom Cruise whatever she accuse
He wasn’t really drunk he just had a few brews
Pass the refreshment a cool cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew present
SteveO swerve homie watch out for the waves
I’m way too black to burn from sunrays
So I just meditated the home in Pompay
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time I’m in Vegas they screaming like he’s Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real got me feelin’ Isrealian
Like Bar Refaeli Gisele no thats Brazilian
Went through deep depression when my momma passed
Suicide what kind of talk is that
But I’ve been talking to God for so long
That I have you look in my life I guess he talking back
Fuckin’ with my clique
On lonely nights I start to fadex2

Don’t look down its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle whatever you do
Don’t look down its an impossible view
Head to the sky wings raised in
Shes about to fly and take her place in
Out there in the stars when she leaves the ground
She’ll see a broken heart if she turns around
But aint no going back this is how it must be
He told her she’ll be burned alive
She just told him trust me
If funerals are beautiful this ugly
Knowing she told her you’ll leave me if you loved me
And he knows that because he knows her
Hard to hide his feeling’s as it engulfs her
Now she’s a bright blaze light rays
A shooting out Phoenix on fire buring up the night scape
So lets hear it for our heroine applaud as our spirits fly into the never end
One closed chapter it opens up another part
So this is more like the end question mark question mark question mark
Don’t look down its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle whatever you do
Don’t look down its an impossible view
Don’t let me hold you back
I only hold you back
We on a deadend street this block has got a culdesac
So fly baby my baby so high sometimes its so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to ballet
We pulled up to the valet we’ll teach our daughter ballet
We’ll raise us a Beyonce maybe she’ll be a Halle
You woulda been the best mom
I would have been the best ‘Ye
You see it all in my veins like varicose
I know thats very gross but we getting very close
To our end though I killed most with a pen
Soon as this flow end I’ma let Mos begin
Don’t look down its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle whatever you doDon’t look down its an impossible view
Don’t look down its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle whatever you do
Don’t look down its an impossible view
How could you do it
How could you do it
Okay now baby here we go we go
Baby this what it be for
I give it all as far as my feet go
What do you mean me go
Why can’t it be we go
What happens when people turn to tears
And weeks turn to years
Huh standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back wish it came with a couple reciepts
Man our vacation was coming next week
Girl I swear you was a trip lets make it a couples retreat do it
How cud my girl do this to me
Woke up sayin no the World did this to me
Now I’m testing one two
Reportin live from the rubble
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
One two three four five models on the double
Give me head all at once look like they line in a huddle
But its not even half the feeling as hearing you shine
She know I love ya shedding tears everyday
And I’m tired of lying in these puddles
I ask “Y” sometimes like a fcking vowel
But hitting tree’s everyday like a fcking owl
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds
Caught the Phoenix Sun to Nash it out I mean ash it out
So I could see you smile
II know you can see me now
Don’t look down its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle whatever you do
Don’t look down its an impossible view
Spread your wings aerialLyrics submitted by Bram Groenteman
damn here we go again
Common passed on this beat I made it to a jam
now everything Im not made me everything I am
damn here we go again
people talking shit but when the shit hit the fan
everything Im not made me everything I am
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
He was as black as the street was
Ill never be laid back as his beat was
I never could see why peoplell reach a
Fakeass facade they couldnt keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah
I never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like WillIam
Let me know if you feel it man
cause everything Im not made me everything I am
Damn here we go again
everybody sayin whats not for him
everything Im not made me everything I am
damn here we go again
people talk shit but when shit hits the fan
everything Im not made me everything I am
and Im back to tear it up
I hear em gearin up
people talk so much shit about me at barbershops
they forget to get their haircut
OK fair enough the streets is flarin up
cause they want guntalk or I dont wear enough
baggy clothes Reeboks or Adidas
can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
so say goodbye to the NAACP award
goodbye to the IndiaArie award
theyd rather give me the niggaplease award
but Ill just take the Igotalotofcheese award
damn here we go again
everything Im not made me everything I am
damn here we go again
people talk shit but when shit hits the fan
everything Im not made me everything I am
I know that people wouldnt usually rap this
but I got the facts to back this
just last year Chicago had over 600 caskets
man killings some wack shit
oh I forgot cept for when niggas is rappin
do you know what it feel like when people is passin
he got changed over his chains a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody pastor
the church want tithe so I cant afford to pay
the slip on the door cause I cant afford to stay
my 15 seconds up but I got more to say
Thats enough Mr West please no more today
damn here we go again
everybody sayin whats not for him
everything Im not made me everything I am
damn here we go again
people talk shit but when shit hits the fan
everything Im not made me everything I am Lyrics submitted by Hai erna
She dont believe in shootin stars
But she believe in shoes cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the stores department
You more like Leau de Stardee shit
Im more of the trips to Florida
Order the hors devors views of the Water
Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy
Man why cant life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a Oeur de Whopee
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than the Nazis
As I recall I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know Flashing lights lights
What do I know Flashing lights lights
I know its been a while
Sweetheart we hardly talk I was doing my thing
I know I was foul baybay
Abay lately you been all on my brain
And if somebody wouldve told me a month ago
Fronting though yo I wouldnt wanna know
If somebody wouldve told me a year ago
Itd go get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no fema
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past you on the other side of the glass
Of my memorys museum
Im just saying Hey Mona Lisa
Come home you know you cant Rome without Caesar
As I recall I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know Flashing lights lights
What do I know Flashing lights lights
As you recall you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
What do you know Flashing lights lights
What do you know Flashing lights lights

all the friends that I know their but so sorry and sure
I dont wanna say goodbye to you so Ill just say goodnight to you
My people wonder why to you Im just gonna say goodnight
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like I could relive it
Me and my grand parents on a field trip
and Im a little kid trying to test the exhibits but
In a faithful I get to get a hold of that
Men I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told I would know the laugh
Men I wouldnt let a moment pass
What would it mean when you dream that youre falling
What would it mean when you dream that youre balling
What would it mean when you never dream at all and u dont really know
but you cant recall them
Its all a fight to get a chance to say hi to
people you never got the chance to say hi to
Maybe you could put them up out of your dream into real life if you try to
So close so close So far so far so far so far no cigar no cigar
you cant dwell on the past all we got is today so Ima live like there is no tomorrow
If I promp my uncle live through you

Tryna hurt my name huh
Wake up Mr West echoes
Uh Yeah Uh yeah uh yeah uh yeah
And I heard em say nothin ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi like Tim its the Hardaway
So this is in the name of love like Robert says
Before you ask me to get a job today can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage
And I know the government administered AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allah o Akbar and throw em some hot cars
Things we see on the screen are not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where im from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they cant cop cars without seein cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars
Uh And I heard em say nothin ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard em say nothin ever promised tomorrow today
Nothings ever promised tomorrow today
But well find a way
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe it hurts but it may be the only way
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas guns a clappin and keep to squeezin
And Gran Grandma keep prayin and keep believin
And Jesus and one day that ya see him
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin
Claimin money is the key so keep on dreamin
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My aunt Pam cant put those cigarettes down
Now my lil cousin smokin those cigarettes now
His job trying to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it cuz his skin blacker than licorice now
I cant figure it out
Uh And I heard em say nothin ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard em say nothin ever promised tomorrow today
Nothings ever promised tomorrow today
But well find a way
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe it hurts but it may be the only way
Cuz every worthless word we get more far away and nothings ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe it hurts but it may be the only way

Are you willing to sacrifice your life
Bitch I’m a monster no good blood sucker

As you run through my jungle all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West sample here’s one for example
Everybody know I’m a muthafcking monster

Less talk more head right now huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I’m bout to take it to another level bitch
There you go again aint nobody as cold as this
Through the rap and the track tripled up and no assist
But my only focus is staying on some bogus sht
Argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her sht
I heard the people sayin raps are gettin trap mayne
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fckin up my money so yeh I had to act sane
Chi ngga but he’s hold of his accent
She came up to me and said this the number 2 gal
If you wanna make it number one your number 2 now

Whatever ever I wanna do gosh its cool now
Nah gonna do uhh its a new now
Think yo muthafcker really really need to cool down
Cause you aint never get on top off this
So mommys best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharoah

Head of the class and she just want a swallow ship

My presence is a present kiss my ass

Rape and pillage a village women and children
Everybody wanna know what my Achilles Heel is

All I see is these nggas I’ve made millionnaires
Milling about spilling there feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fcks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice cold veins

Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up
Everybody know I’m a muthafcking monster

Cause that’s what a muthafcking monster do
Hairdresser from milan thats the monster do
Monster Giuseppe heel that’s the monster shoe
Young money is the roster and a monster crew
And I’m all up all up all up in the bank with a funny face
And if I’m fake I dont know this cause my money aint
Now let me get this straight wait I’m the rookie
But my features and my shows ten times your pay
50k for a verse no album out
Yet my money’s so tall that my barbie’s gotta climb it
Hotter than a middle eastern climate climate
Find it 20 mataran dutty whine it whine it
Nicki on a pit while I sign it
How these nggas so onetrack minded
But really really I don’t give a FUCK
Forget barbie fck Nicki cause she’s fake
She’s on a diet but her pockets eating cheese cake
And I’ll say Bride of Chucky is Child’s play
Just killed another career it’s a mild day
Besides ‘Yay they can’t stand besides me
I think me you and him should minaj friday
Papapapink wig thick ass give em whip lash
I thithithithink big get cash make em blink fast
Nownownow look at what you just saw this is what you live for
Aaahhhh I’m a muthafcking monster
And I’llI’ll let God decidecide
II wouldn’t last these shows
So II am headed home
And I’llI’ll let God decidecide
II wouldn’t last these shows
So II am headed homeLyrics submitted by Rob
Told you I wont let you down
Told you I wont let this rap game change me right
When it comes to being true at least true to me
One thing I foundone thing I found
Oh no youll neva let me down
Yo yo first I snatched the street then I snatched the charts
First had they ear now I hav theyre heart
Ive been hear from the start
Seen them put it together
Watch them take it apart
See the Rovers roll up wit ribbons
Ive seen them repoed resold and redriven
So when I reload he holds 1 position
When u hot Im hot
And when your feet cold mines is sizzelin
Niggas cant f wit me
Cuz ima be that nigga fo life
This is not an image
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga Im home on these charts yall niggaz visitin
Its Hov tradition Jeff Gordan of rap
Im back to claim pole position holla at ya boy
I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit that seat where white folks aint wanna us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
With that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas cant make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob and to the dealership
Thats why I hear new music
And I just dont be feeling it
Racism still alive they just be concealing it
But I know they dont want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sams club
I did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear Ive been baptised at least 3 or 4 times
But in the land where niggas praise
It gon take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than dorags to get your waves
Noting sadder than that day my girl father past away
So I promised to Mr Rany Im gonna marry your daughter
And u know I gotta thank u for they way that she was brought up
And I know that u were smiling when u see that car I bought her
And u sent tears from heaven when u seen my car get balled up
But I cant complaint what the accident did to my Left Eye
Cuz look what a accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah and now romeo must die
I know a got angels watching me from the other side
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You dont need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math
Cats think Im delirious but Im so damn serious
Thats why I expose my soul to the globe the world
Im trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
Im not just another individual my spirit is a part of this
Thats why I get spiritual but I get my hymns from Him
So its not me its He thats lyrical
Im not a miracle Im a heavensent instrument
My rhythmatic regimen navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
Vibrations is what Im into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that is not what gives me the heart of Kunte Kinte
Im tryina give us us free like Cinque
I cant stop thats why Im hot
Im talking to you my many inspirations
When I say I cant let you or self down
If I were of the highest cliff on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life in my grip
I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it been known that Gods penmanship has been signed with a language called love
Thats why my breath is felt by the deaf
And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess Im one of a kind in a full house
Cuz whenever I open my heart my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Who else you know been hot this long
Oh Ya you know we aint finished
Started from nothing but he got this strong
The ROC is in the building
Built the ROC from a pebble pedalled rock before I met you
Pedalled bikes got my nephews pedal bikes because they special
Let you tell that man Im falling
Well somebody mustve caught him
Cause every fourth quarter I like to Mike Jordan em
Number one albums what I got like four of dem
More of dem on the way
The Eight Wonder on the way
Clear the way Im here to stay
Yall can save the chitter chat this and that this and Jay
Dissin Jay ill get you mased
When I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six Hail Maries please Father forgive us
Young the Archbishop the Pope John Paul of yall niggas
The way yall all follow Jigga
Hovs a living legend and I tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov still alive
Told you I wont let you down
Told you I wont let this rap game change me right
When it comes to being true at least true to me

Chi towns D Rose I’m movin’ the Nets to BK

Excuse my French but I’m in France I’m just sayin’

I’m livin’ in the 21st century
Doin’ something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the ’80s got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his own theme music
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s tickin’ I just count the hours
Stop trippin’ I’m trippin’ off the power
The system broken the schools closed the prisons open
We ain’t got nothin’ to lose ma’fucka we rollin’
With some lightskinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world we the ones chosen
So goodnight cruel world I see you in the mornin’
Huh I see you in the mornin’
This is way too much I need a moment
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s tickin’ I just count the hours
Stop trippin’ I’m trippin’ off the power
‘Til then fuck that the world’s ours
And then they 21st century schizoid man
Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell ‘em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically they can kiss my asshole
I’m an asshole You niggas got jugs
You shortminded niggas’ thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian my ice brought the Dodies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He know he so fuckin’ gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind but couldn’t open up my own vault
My childlike creativity purity and honesty
Is honestly being prodded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catchin’ up with me
Takin’ my inner child I’m fighting for it custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamondencrusted piece
Nigga no one man should have all that power
The clock’s tickin’ I just count the hours
Stop trippin’ I’m trippin’ off the power
‘Til then fuck that the world’s ours
And then they 21st century schizoid man
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin’ nation
They say I was the obamanation of Obama’s nation
Well that’s a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of day goddammit I’m killin’ this shit
I know damn well y’all feelin’ this shit
I don’t need yo’ pussy bitch I’m on my own dick
I ain’t gotta power trip who you goin’ home with
How ‘Ye doin’ I’m survivin’
I was drinkin’ earlier now I’m drivin’
Where the bad bitches huh Where ya hidin’
I got the power make yo’ life so excitin’ So excitin’
Now this’ll be a beautiful death
Now this’ll be a beautiful death

See you in my nightmare oh well how did you get there
Cause we were once a fairytale
But this is fair well

And thats one thing that you know

But not quite cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight and I might

I really thought we meant it
But Now we just repenting

Ive been workin this graveshift and I aint made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and flypast the sky
Ive been workin this graveshift and I aint made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and flypast the sky
If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then Im gonna shorten the register up
Lets go back back to the Gap
Look at my check wasnt no scratch
So if I stole wasnt my fault
Yeah I stole never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye lets put him all in the front of the store
Saw him on break next to the No Smoking sign with a blunt and a Marl
Takin my hits writin my hits
Writin my rhymes playin my mind
This fuckin job cant help him
So I quit yall welcome
Yall dont know my struggle
Yall cant match my hustle
You cant catch my hustle
You cant fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doin five beats a day for three summers
Thats a different world like three summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Mayback
So many records in my basement
Im just waitin on my spaceship blaow
Ive been workin this graveshift and I aint made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and flypast the sky
Ive been workin this graveshift and I aint made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and flypast the sky
Man Im talkin way past the sky
And I didnt even try to work a job
At the same time thirsty on the grind
Lost my momma lost my mind
My life my love thats not mine
Leave me alone work for yall
Half of its yours half of its mine
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall til 12 when my schedule wore headset nine
Puttin known ass on shelves
Waitin paitently I ask myself
Qhere I wanna go where I wanna be
Life is much more than runnin in the streets
Holla at ye hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet
Yes Im the same ol G same goatee
Holler at God Man whyd you had to take my folks
Hope to see Freddy G Yusef G
Love my G Rolly G
Police watch me smoke my weed count my Gs
Got a lot of people countin on me
And Im just tryin to find my peace
Should of finished school like my niece
Then I wouldnt finally wouldnt use my piece blaow
Aw man all this pressure
Ive been workin this graveshift and I aint made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and flypast the sky
Ive been workin this graveshift and I aint made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and flypast the sky
I remember havin to take the dollar cab
Comin home real late at night
Standin on my feet all damn day
Tryin to make this thing right
And havin one of my coworkers say Yo you look just like
This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night
Well easy come easy go
No more broad service cars and them TV shows
I all had that snatched from me
And all the faculties all turn their back on me
And didnt wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin back at me
Cuz nothings there nothings fair
I dont wanna ever go back there
So I wont bee a spaceship and fly past the sky
Ive been workin this graveshift and I aint made shit
I wish I could buy me takin no days off til my spaceship takes off
Ive been workin this graveshift and I aint made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and flypast the sky
Ive been workin this graveshift and I aint made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and flypast the sky
I wanna fly I wanna fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take me brother for a rideLyrics submitted by Natalie
Do I still got time to grow
Things aint always set in stone
That being known let me know
Seems like street lights glowing
Happen to be just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
See I know my destination
But Im just not there

I gotta testify come up in the spot looking extra fly
For the day I die Imma touch the sky
Gotta testify come up in the spot looking extra fly
For the day I die Imma touch the sky
Back when they thought pink polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop the doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boys street team I couldnt work the Lox locks
Take em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in the UHaul van
Any pessimists I aint talked to them
Plus I aint have no phone in my apartment
Lets take em back to the club
Least about an hour I would stand on line
I just wanted to dance
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance
I just wanted to shine
Jays favorite line Dog in due time
Now he look at me like Damn dog you where I am
I think I died in an accident cause this must be heaven
Now lets take em highighighighighigh la la la la la la la
Top of the world baby TTop of the world
Now lets take em highighighighighigh la la la la la la la
Top of the world baby TTop of the world
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
Id do anything to say I got it
Damn them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted KWest beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog I was having nervous breakdowns
Like Damn these niggas that much better than me
Baby Im going on an airplane
And I dont know if Ill be back again
Sure enough I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it things became different
Any girl I cheated on sheets I skeeted on
I couldnt keep it home I thought I needed a Nia Long
Im trying to write my wrongs
But its funny these same wrongs helped me write this song
I gotta testify come up in the spot looking extra fly
For the day you die You gonna touch the sky
You gonna touch the sky babygirl Testify come up in the spot
For the day you die You gonna touch the sky
Yes yes yes guess whos on third
Lupe steal like Lupin the Third
Hear like ear till Im beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Slow it down like were on the syrup
Bottleshaped body like Mrs Butterworths
But before you say another word
Im back on the block like Im laying on the street
Im trying to stop lion like a MumRa
But Im not lying when Im laying on the beat
Engarge touché Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge
I come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car
So I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are like
We back at home baby
Feels good to be home baby Feels good to be home Lyrics submitted by noa bendor
Unh can the headphones go louder
Can’t a young nigga get money anymore
Tell PETA my mink is draggin’ on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch wit’out no flaws
Come to meet me wit’out no drawers
Dinner with Anna Wintour racin’ wit’ Anja Rubik
I told you ma’fuckers it was more than the music
In the projects one day to Project Runway
We done heard all that loudass talkin’ we used to it
I’m from where shorties fucked up doublecupped up
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it
So whoever think they words affect me is too stupid
And if you could do it better than me then you do it
We flyer than the parakeet floatin’ wit’ no parachute
Six thousanddollar pair of shoes we made it to the Paris news
Don’t talk about style ‘cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me ‘fore I embarrass you
Can’t a young nigga get money anymore
Tell PETA my mink is draggin’ on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch wit’out no flaws
Come to meet me wit’out no drawers
And the whole industry wanna fuck yo’ old chick
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz
And I’ll admit I fell in love with Kim
‘Round the same time she had fell in love wit’ him
Well that’s cool baby girl do ya thing
Lucky I ain’t have Jay drop ‘im from the team
We in the buildin’ but still keep it basement
Flyer than the parakeet floatin’ wit’ no parachute
Six thousanddollar pair of shoes I made it to the Paris news
Don’t talk about style ‘cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me ‘fore I embarrassed you
GOOD Music we fresh we fresh
Anything else we detest detest
Bitchass niggas got ass and breasts
All that said lemme ask this quest’
Can’t a young nigga get money anymore
Tell PETA my mink is draggin’ on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch wit’out no flaws
Come to meet me wit’out…
Don’t talk to me ‘bout style nigga I’ll ma’fuckin’ embarrass you
Talkin’ ‘bout clothes I’ll ma’fuckin’ embarrass you
Hollin’ ‘bout some hoes I’ll ma’fuckin’ embarrass you
Way too cold I promise you’ll need some Theraflu
Uh uh uh uh uh Get the Theraflu
Uh uhuh uhuh uh Get the Theraflu
Uh uhuh uhuh uh uhuh uhuh
Uh uhuh uhuh uh Get the Theraflu
My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him were pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brandnew report card
And all I got was a brandnew sportscar
And my head keeps spinning
Can’t stop having these visions
I gotta keep with it
Dad cracked a joke alle the kids laughed
But I couldn’t here him all the way in firstclass
Chased the goodlife all my life long
Look back on my life all my life gone
Where did I go wrong
And my head keeps spinning
Can’t stop having these visions
I gotta keep with it
I’ve seen it I’ve seen it before
I’ve seen it I’ve seen it before
I’ve seen it I’ve seen it before
I’ve seen it I’ve seen it before
My god said she’s getting married by the lake
But I couldn’t figure out who I’d wanna take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave before they even cut the cake
And my head keeps spinning
Can’t stop having these visions
I gotta keep with it
And I can and I can’t stop
No no I can’t stop
No no no no I can’t stop
No no no no I can’t stop
Can’t stop having these visions
I gotta keep with itLyrics submitted by Leandra
