I grew up a fuckin screw up
Tie my shoe up wish they was newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city I wish I knew her
I wish I wont so shy I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That Im the perfect nigga for her but then maybe thats a lie
She like a certain type of nigga and its clear Im not that guy
Ball player star player Im just watchin from the side
On the bench cause my lack of confidence wont let me fly
I aint grow up with my father I aint thinkin bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now Ill probably cry
When I realize what I missed but as of now my eyes are dry
Cause Im tryna stay alive
In the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin quiet tryna dodge a suit and tie
Who am I Aye who am I Yeah
Things change rearrange and so do I
It aint always for the better dawg I cant lie
I get high cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I dont fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to sooth your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along nothing to see
I always did shit the hard way my niggas slangin in the hallway
Burnt CDs and trees like this was broadway Times Square
Kept the dimes there in the locker
With more brown hairs than Chubacca
Whispers that he got it for the low low
Sell a dime for a dub them white boys aint know no better
Besides whats twenty dollars to a nigga like that
He tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon get it right back
Got home snatched my mama keychain took her whip
The appeal too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard pull up to my nigga front door
His mama at home she still let em hit the blunt though
I told her hello and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash and just asked
What a nigga gotta do to get that Put me on
He just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing his demeanor said more
He told me Nigga you know how you sound right now
You wont my mans I would think that you a clown right now
Listen you everything I wanna be thats why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you
You bout to go get a degree Ima be stuck with two choices
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what A hundred bucks or two a week
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me
I got four brothers one mother that dont love us
If they aint never want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers
I felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear
And thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama dry your eyes there aint no reason to cry
You made a genius and I aint gon take it for granted
I aint gon settle for lesser I aint gon take what they handed
Nah Im gon take what they owe me and show you that I can fly
And show ol girl what she missing
Things change rearrange and so do I Aye who am I
It aint always for the better dawg I cant lie Aye who am I
I get high cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I dont fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to sooth your soul
If you see my tears fall just let me be
Move along nothing to see
Since a youngin always dreamed of gettin rich
Look at me my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees my nigga
Used to want a pathfinder with some tints
Thats all I need my nigga
Throw some 20s on that bitch and get it wrenched
But now I see my nigga
That the worlds a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper and they say my nigga Eddie caught a body Im convinced
Anybody is a killer all you gotta do is push em to the limps
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin with the pushers and the pimps
Im tryna write a story can I get a glimpse
Yeah can I get a glimpse
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing
They robbin niggas on the daily
Keep on blamin nigga that aint never had things
Guess not last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like
Uh nice watch run it
Hands in the air now hands in the air run it
Hands in the air now hands in the air run it
Hands in the air now hands in the air
Hands in the air now hands in the air
Small town nigga Hollywood dreams
I know that everything that glitters aint gold
I know the shits not always good as it seems
But tell me till you get it how could you know
How could you know How could you know
Listen up Im about to go and get rich
Fuck with me my nigga
We gonna slug around the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some tree my nigga
And some powder bag it up and make it flip
You gon see my nigga
One day we gon graduate and cop a brick
And thats the key my nigga
Listen up Im bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to nigga
Me I want my pockets fat badder bitch
Tired of seein niggas flaunt I wanna flaunt too nigga
Watch some rollers in the fuckin Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up thats what they wont do nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit
Even if you let em kill your dream itll haunt you nigga
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing
I look around like do you wanna be another nigga that aint never had things
Guess not last night we pulled up on a nigga at the light like
Uh nice watch run it
Hands in the air now hands in the air run it
Hands in the air now hands in the air run it
Hands in the air now hands in the air
Hands in the air now hands in the air
Father forgive me for me childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command my command my command but
Before you go Ive got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you get your piece but no peace wont be found
So why just take me man take me man take me man
Your wish is my command my command my command
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the lord to follow me
I dont know why you call on me
Ima paint it how I want it baby oh I
Ima paint it paint it paint it how I want it nigga
There is no right or wrong
I like to write alone
Think back to Forest Hills no perfect home
But the only thing like home Ive ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
Im so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasin panties gettin dome
Had no clue what you was goin through
How could you be so strong
And how could I be so selfish I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl
Damn she so selfless but she put up with my way
Because she loves me like you do
And though it dont always show I love her just like I love you
And I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever so we could spend more time together
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the lord to follow me
I dont know why you call on me
Apparently you believe in me you believe in me
Apparently you believe in me and I thank you for it
Another day another rhyme ho
Another day another time zone
Today I woke up feelin horny so its only right
I got two bitches playin on my trumbone
Keep up never sure where the words would take me
Niggas eat em up and regurgitate me
Shit jumped tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me
Best friends really make great for enemies
My watch came niggas cant wait for one of these
I see you nigga this aint no Rolex its a AP nigga
Im hot dog catch up to me nigga
Aim for the stars and I shouldnt have missed
But I was ridin on fumes so I stopped by the moon
Now Im sittin on the hood of this bitch
Like thanks for the view
Waitin on thanks from a few cause without me you wouldnt exist
You know that shit gave you the blueprint dont forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off now niggas showin off
Niggas swear they hard but they flowin soft
Im taking off like boing on a big ass Boeing
Gettin head like a coin toss
I keep my head high
I got my wings to carry me
I want my dreams to rescue me
I keep my faith strong
I ask the lord to follow me
I dont know why you call on me
Apparently you believe in me you believe in me
Apparently you believe in me and I thank you for it
Spinning in circles live my life without rehearsal
If I die today my nigga was it business Was it personal
Should this be my last breath Im blessed cause it was purposeful
Never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
You made me versatile wellrounded like cursive
Know you chose me for a purpose I put my soul in these verses
Born sinner was never born to be perfect
Sucka for women licking their lips and holding these purses
Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers
Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
I saw but never noticed that a college point is right to
Be all that you can be posters
Rest in peace to Tiffany I dont know if this is the realest shit I wrote
But know the realest nigga wrote this
And signed it and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day youd find it
And knew one day that youd come back and rewind this singing
But I die better than that swear
You were always where I needed you to be
Whether you were there or not there I was there
But I live better than that better tonight
If you ain’t fucking with that
I don’t care yeah yeah yeah
Yeah this music shit is a gift
But God help us make it cause this music business is a cliff
I got a life in my grip she holding tight to my wrist
She screaming Dont let me slip
She see the tears in my eyes I see the fear on her lips
True when I told you You the only reason why I dont flip and go insane
My roof in the pouring rain
You knew me before the fame dont lose me the more I change
No just grow with me go broke you go broke with me
I smoke you gon smoke with me
Womans curse since birth man lead her to the hearse
I go Bobby you go Whitney damn
Listen here Ill tell you my biggest fears
You the only one who knows them
Dont you ever go expose them
This life is harder than youll probably ever know
Emotions I hardly ever show
More for you than for me
I gotta do this for me
They tell me life is a test but wheres the tutor for me
Pops came late Im already stuck in my ways
Ducking calls from my mother for days
Sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
Cant wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
Need yall niggas to feel me yo
Said soft niggas cant last hard times yo
Was just a youngin with that fresh fade
That hoop dreaming had me tryna be the next Penny
Fresh pennies on my feet
Momma paid for everything Im wearing
At the fair staring at girls not a care in the world
Aw nigga but shit done changed since Mayne was my nickname
A little nigga chasing things tryna kick game
Now Im a man worried about my fam
Its like my pockets stay broke and if not them shits sprained
And so I rap for my niggas trapped in the struggle
Feeling like the worlds on your back so you stumble
And it feels like a quarterback get sacked and then you fumble
Jobs dont call a nigga back so its back to the hustle
Niggas praying for they moms
At the same time they moms pray for them
Ask the Lord to stay with them guide them on they way
But damn a nigga been a lost fate
It hurts on the usual
The only time you catch me up at church is a funeral
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain my nigga
I dont know if Ill see tomorrow
But I wont cry no I cant cry
And in this life times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that Im aiming for the stars my nigga
I wont stop try til the day I die
And I wont cry no I cant cry no
I sit back and watch the news every now and then
Either get depressed or mad from watching the world just crash
It be the same shit got my brain twisted
Like damn its 06 and niggas still up on that gang shit
Yesterday this kid got his whole frame split
Only seventeen he was finna graduate in like three weeks
some stupid niggas got him for his chain
But he fought back they blasted him and left him on the pavement
And now they telling me this little girl just got raped
Some dude snatched her and she was standing at the bus stop wait
What the fuck is up with this world
got these grown niggas fucking with girls
Plus the cops harassing us
every week be blasting us on accident or so they claim
Reporters sympathizing like they truly know the pain
They killed her only son
Make her wanna blow her brains out
Change the channel man I cant watch this shit
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain my nigga
I dont know if Ill see tomorrow
But I wont cry no I cant cry
And in this life times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that Im aiming for the stars my nigga
I wont stop try til the day I die
And I wont cry no I cant cry no
Take a ride through the city man and tell me what you witness
Poverty richness crooked cops and misfits
neighborhoods looking like theres still segregation
welfare single mothers no jobs
tryna get a piece for yourself but they hogging up the whole pie
fiegns in the street so high off of that crack shit
this nigga thirteen with a gat under his mattress
White folks got the road to success mapped and thats all good
but why dont blacks got that same atlas
I asked the same question a million ways
and it seems like I had prayed for a million days
Still the ills remain just bills and pain
Shoot outs and project buildings children slain
skies filled with rain and I just sit and wonder why
Its enough to make a nigga wanna cry
Sometimes sunshine turn to rain my nigga
The same ones you love will bring you pain my nigga
I dont know if Ill see tomorrow
But I wont cry no I cant cry
And in this life times getting hard my nigga
But fuck that Im aiming for the stars my nigga
I wont stop try til the day I die
And I wont cry no I cant cry noLyrics submitted by savannah

And I got something to prove

And checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing

One day yall have to decide who you gon be
A scary nigga or a nigga thats gon rule like me

Came from the bottom nigga with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me I came from the dirt
Money my motivator the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin from pawn to a King
You tell me ya still love me if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn never know
Look in my eyes and see the future
But dont sugar coat it
History repeats itself and thats just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
Justin Timberlake Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gone snatch the crown
Look around my nigga white people have snatched the sound
This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
Im just playin but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on theyll hang you with
But not Jermaine my aim too sick
I bang nigga I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game I aint stupid
I recognize that life is a dream and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds one verse at a time
And claim too sick And fuck it if the shoe fits
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
While the people debate whos the king of this rap game
Here comes lil ol Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever yall think has it
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof boom paow its like magic
With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
Aint gonna be no more kings
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
But in reality hes a coward
Ultimately hes scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when Im in tune with the most high
The fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
Today I know that we are the same
Are the same you and I
Different kind of skin different set of eyes
Two different minds but only one God
Its only one God nigga
Its for all the kings
Cause deep down I know every poet just wanna be loved
You wanna know just where Im at
Well let me tell you bout it
I put my city on the map
But let me tell you bout it
They tryna say I cant come back
Ay let me tell you bout it
Man fuck them nigga I come back
Ay let me tell you bout it
I wanna tell you bout it
Cole outside and he say he got a gun
Niggas like man thats what everybody say
Go and pop the trunk and everybody dead
Everybody scared of the nigga
Aware that the nigga is better
All my bitches the pick of the litter
Niggas is faker than anime
Me I never hate get cake like Anna Mae woah
Eat the cake bitch eat the damn cake
Fuck good nigga we demand great
Order Dominos and she take off all her clothes
Nigga you know how it goes make the pizza man wait
Even hoes try and keep it and I leak the damn tape
Rest in peace any nigga want beef
Even secret service couldnt keep the man safe
I said to the window to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I aint you and you aint me
Get off my dick woah
Get the fuck off my dick
Get off my dick woah
Get the fuck off my dick nigga
Get off my dick bitch woah
Get the fuck off my dick
Get off my dick bitch woah
Man fuck them niggas I come home and I dont tell nobody
They gettin temporary dough and I dont tell nobody
Lord will you tell me if I changed I wont tell nobody
I wanna go back to Jermaine and I wont tell nobody
This is the part that the thugs skip
Young nigga never had love
You know foot massage back rub shit
Blowing bubbles in the bathtub shit
That is until I met you
Together we done watch years go by
Seen a river of your tears go by
Got me thinkin bout some kids still I
Tell them hoes come through
Get to know somebedy and you learn a lot about em
When we long for you start to doubt em
Tell yourself you better off without em
Then in time you will find cant walk without em
Cant talk without em cant breath without em
Came here together you cant leave without em
So you walk back in make a scene about em
On your Amerie its just 1 thing about em
Niggas dont sing about it no more
Dont nobody sing about it no more
Niggas dont sing about it no more
Dont nobody sing about it no more
Nigga I dont sing about this shit no more
But there a nigga in the club singing
I said to the window to the wall
My nigga ride when I call
Got bitches all in my mind
Fuck nigga blocking my shine
I know the reason you feel the way
I know just who you wan be
So everyday I thank the man upstairs
That I aint you and you aint me
But every nigga in the club singing
Got all the bitches in the club singing
And all they mamas let their kids sing it
The baby mamas and the mistresses
Song yeah song song yeah
Why every rich black nigga gotta be famous
Why every broke black nigga gotta be brainless
Driven by some people up in Ariel Heights
Young Cole pockets is fat like little Terrio
Dreamville give us a year well be on every show
Yeah fuck nigga Im very sure
Fuck the rest Im the best nigga out
When Im back home Im the best in the South
When Im in LA Im the best in the West
You can test you can test Imma stretch niggas out
Oooh Imma stretch niggas out
That go for all yall if I left niggas out
This shit for everbody on my testicle
Please make sure you put the rest in your mouth ho
And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes 2 now
Oh what do I do now
Cause if we ever got together
Id have to be them niggas steppops forever
And well that aint my thing cause I
I aint even got my own
And I aint really got no home
No place to put these things I own
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the games you used to play
And I thought about that little kid
And I thought about the things we did
I always thought that we would be together
I always knew that we would be together
But I dont wanna wait forever
I dont wanna wait forever
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Shit seem so sad when you look back
Everythings so sad when you look back
On the rebound like a book back
On the rebound like a put back
Dont just sit back bitch get on it
Time fly by way too quick dont it
Reflection bring regrets dont it
So you protect your pride with your reflexes
But life is a game with no reset on the end
It aint no lookin back no no no no
It aint no lookin back no no no no
It aint no lookin back no no no no
It aint no lookin back no no no no
It aint no lookin back no no no no
It aint no lookin back no no no no
And I thought about you today
And I thought about the things you used to say
And I thought about the things we did
And I thought about your newest kid
And damn that makes 2 now
Oh what do I do now
Do or Die new arrival
You survive yous alive yo
Now either you follow me and ride or yous a rival
The difference between you and I is you a model you posing
But who am I though
The mulatto out for that lotto
Money coming soon the newest model
The type of niggas got more dick chew and swallow
Your girl told me shoot in her face she suicidal
Oh shucks you niggas is closed you fold up
Im from the Ville niggas get killed over four bucks
Thank God we made it my niggas we grown up
Now we crazy over that bread call us the doughnuts uh
More sluts once the money blows up
But them hoes stop if the dough drops
I wont stop though a chip off the ol block
Im from a city where niggas hole blocks
Leave you looking like old socks damn
Cops patrol blocks spotting on us
The boys is rotten I know they want us
Probably arrest a nigga get a bonus
You kill a nigga get promoted
Shit is crazy girls getting babies before they get diplomas
So much I just go nuts
Niggas telling me slow up
Im tryna get where that cheddar at
Always somebody that dont want you getting cheese yo
This whole bullshit is like Tom and Jerry
Im kinda very raw niggas cant deny facts
If you black they sending you to jail or Iraq
Honor is something you cant sell or buy back
Niggas dont like bragging they 911 fly cats
Hijack niggas Get up out your whip nigga strip
I want it all ice on your wrists and the kicks
This shit happens I aint just rapping believe it yo
They got streets in the city police wont even go
It aint no secret niggas beefing cause my ego so big
It got me speaking like Im diesel like Im devil oh
Niggas know my stylo I aint tweaking I am lethal though
Have your daddy looking for you
This aint Finding Nemo though
Let me slow it down dumb it down yall warned
The son came up out that womb yo a star is born
If real recognize real yall are foreign
My team run a play on your bitch and we all scoring yeaLyrics submitted by imaniani g
The real is back the ville is back
Flow bananas here peel this back
And what youll find is your highness
Can paint a picture that is vivid enough to cure blindness
Carolinas finest you knew that already
And turned to the greatest I proved that already
And if you would like I do it twice
I just sharpen my blade for a minute became lost in my ways
This for my niggas that was tossin the graves
Every so often I fade deep in my thoughts and get lost in the days
We used to play before your coffin was made
Just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
Just got paid what Cochran got paid to free OJ
Just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
Who know a nigga far too well and thats the danger
Know me better than I know myself
I rip a page out my notebook in anger
And let these thoughts linger singing
Dont give em too much you
Dont let em take control
Its one thing you do
Dont let em taint your soul
If you believe in God
If you aint aim too high
Then you aim too low
Whats the price for a black man life
I check the toe tag not one zero in sight
I turn the TV on not one hero in sight
Unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
Look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights cameras and action
May no man alive come through and damage my faction
I brought you niggas with me cause I love you like my brothers
And your mothers like my mother
Think we need a plan of action
The bigger we get the more likely egos collide
Its just physics please lets put our egos aside
You my niggas and should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
I hope that we remember these
When Hov around we switch up to that Dusse
Gotta show respect one day we tryna stay where you stay
Cause we from where you from
Not talkin bout the slums
Im talkin bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
Keep a black nigga dyin by a black nigga gun
And keep on listening to the frontin ass rap niggas son
This is New Yorks finest
For 11 winters straight I took on New Yorks climate
Like show me New Yorks ladder
I climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get Obama to force the air force to find it
Never mind it youll never reach that
Cole is the hypnotist control the game whenever he snap
Dont give em too much you
Dont let em take control
Its one thing you do
Dont let em taint your soul
If you believe in God
If you aint aim too high
Then you aim too low
I aint serve no pies I aint slang no dope
I dont bring no lies niggas sang my quotes
I dont play no games boy I aint no joke
Like the great Rakim when I make my notes
You niggas might be L or you might be Kane
Or you might be Slick Rick with 19 chains
Or you might be Drizzy Drake or Kendrick Lamar
But check your birth date nigga you aint the God
Nah you aint the God
No such thing as a life thats better than yours
No such thing as a life thats better than yours
No such thing as a life thats better than yours
No such thing no such thing
Heart beatin fast let a nigga know that he alive
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive
Dont be sleepin on your level cause its beauty in the struggle nigga
Its beauty in the struggle nigga
Its beauty in the struggle ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas down the block man we were blessed
And life cant be no fairytale no once upon a time
But I be God damned if a nigga dont be tryin
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind
Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches listen this is what youll find
The good news is nigga you came a long way
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way
Think being broke was better
No such thing as a life thats better than yours
No such thing as a life thats better than yours
No such thing as a life thats better than yours
No such thing no such thing
For whats money without happiness
Or hard times without the people you love
Though Im not sure whats bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
Cause Ive been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosening
Quick do something before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
Im tired of living with demons cause they always inviting more
Think being broke was better
Now I dont mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there living in debt
Turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And thats a nigga who was once in your shoes
Living with nothin to lose
I hope one day you hear me
Always gon be a bigger house somewhere but nigga feel me
Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon be a whip thats better than the the one you got
Always gon be some clothes thats fresher than the ones you rock
Always gon be a bitch thats badder out there on the tours
But you aint never gon be happy till you love yours
No such thing as a life thats better than yours
No such thing as a life thats better than yours
No such thing as a life thats better than yours
No such thing no such thing
Heart beatin fast let a nigga know that he alive
Snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive
First things first rest in peace Uncle Phil
For real you the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant Ima be a better you
Prophesies that I made way back in the Ville
For Phil Listen even back when we was broke my team ill
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville
One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas cant tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows
She dont wanna be saved
She dont wanna be saved
She dont wanna be saved
She dont wanna be saved
No role models and Im here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin through my memory my memory
Last night I was gettin my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch not Trina but I swear to God
This bitch will make you call your girl up and tell her Hey whats good
Sorry Im never comin home Ima stay for good
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 911 in white neighborhoods
Aint got no shame bout it
She think Im spoiled and Im rich cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said Nah I was the same without it
But then I thought back back to a better me
Before I was a Blist celebrity
Before I started callin bitches bitches so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas cant tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows
She dont wanna be saved
She dont wanna be saved
She dont wanna be saved
She dont wanna be saved
I want a real love dark skinned and Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you aint gotta wonder whether thats your kid love
Nigga I dont want no bitch from reality shows
Out of touch with reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin back 5 or 6 hoes
Fuck em then we kick em to the door
Nigga you know how it go
She deserved that she a bird its a bird trap
You think if I didnt rap she would flirt back
Takin off her skirt let her wear my shirt before she leave
Ima need my shirt back
Nigga you know how it go
One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes
Lame niggas cant tell the difference
One time for a nigga who knows
She dont wanna be saved
She dont wanna be saved
She dont wanna be saved
She dont wanna be saved
Theres an old saying in Tennessee I know its in Texas probably in Tennessee that says fool me once shame on shame on you
If you fool me we cant get fooled again
Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice cant put the blame on you
Fool me three times fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper let it rain on you
Fool me one time shame on you
Fool me twice cant put the blame on you
Fool me three times fuck the peace signs
Load the chopper let it rain on you

Hand her a script the bitch probably couldnt read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret could never take Aaliyah home
Now all Im left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face cause they know its they song
She shallow but the pussy deep she shallow she shallow

Old chicks cryin cause they know that they lost out
But Im still on you Im still on you
My drink spilled on me while I feel on you
Hook 2 Miguel J Cole

I hate rich niggas goddammit
Cause I aint never had a lot dammit
Who you had to kill who you had to rob
Who you had to fuck just to make it to the top dammit
Or maybe thats daddy money escalator no ladder money
Worst fear going broke cause Im bad with money
Crookest smile nigga momma never had the money damn
I aint trippin a nigga Jordan I aint Pippen yeah
Up the steps I aint slippin
Tears blood sweat I aint crippin Pierce
A song you can sing along with when you down
So I let you know you aint alone shit
When your momma aint at home cause she got a second job
Delivering pizzas you think she out there getting robbed
Please God watch her I know how niggas do
Half cracker but a nigga too
Talking all that shit bout your steppops
How he was a dog now look at you
I aint bad as that nigga plus dawg Im a grown man now
I aint mad at that nigga
But if a plane crash and only it killed his lame ass
Id be glad its that nigga
Did Kate dirty now its back to broke
Refund check she used that to float
Momma gets depressed falls in love with the next maniac
On crack use that to cope
Make a nigga smoke a whole sack of dope
Writing rhymes tryna bring back the hope
Try to ride the storm out and crash the boat could of drowned
But I grabbed the rope
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knewx3
You got what I want
I got what you need
How much for your soul and uh
How much for your soul and uh
I hate rich niggas goddammit
Cause I aint never had a lot dammit
Niggas cant front on the flows you got
But every fucking verse how much dough you got
Homie dont quit now hear my shit and tried to switch now
Know you felt the shit just now know you felt the shit just now
Aint it more to you Dont it ever get boring to you
I realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power
Fuck it more to you so I threw you
And it made me ashamed that I played the game
Not for more money like Damon Wayons
Wanted the respect but it came with fame
I just wanted love but it just aint the same
I took a train down memory lane
And watching little Jermaine do his thang before he made a name
He gave it all he got now the nigga dont paint the same
I guess he cant complain
All the money that be raining in
Spend a hundred thou for the chain again
Thinking old school niggas like Dana Dane
Probably kill for another claim to fame
My brain the same yeah nigga at least he aint insane
You aint crazy motherfucker you just afraid of change
Thats new maybe thats true
But listen here I got a bigger fear
Of one day that I become you
And I become lost and I become heartless
And numb from all the Ménages
Just one bitch dont feel the same no more
And Henny dont really kill the pain no more
Now Im Cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
Cause I cant maintain no more
Tad bit extreme I know
Money cant save your soul
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
And nigga who you x3
Selling me dreams and telling me things you knew
How much for your soul and uhLyrics submitted by Nani Santos
Roll up and smoke my sins away
Id like to go to St Tropez

Let me take yall back man
As I do so well
Man it wasnt nothin like that first time
She was in my math class
Long hair brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me used to laugh had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin it
I was a youngen straight crushin tryna play this shit cool
But a nigga couldnt wait to get to school
Cause when I seen em thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreaming man what
Im thinkin how she rides on it if she sits on it if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up
As time goes by attractions getting deep and
Wet dreaming thinkin that Im smashin but Im sleepin
I want it bad and I aint never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said You ever had sex before
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
I wrote back and said Of course I had sex before
I said Im like a pro baby
But if I told the truth I knew Id get played out son
Hadnt been in pussy since the day I came out one
But she dont know that
So she done wrote back and told me
Oh you a pro homie Well I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday baby we can get to freakin
Thats when my heart start racing and my body start sweatin
Baby you done woke my lil man up
Im thinkin how that body look naked when you laying on the bed
Teacher please dont make me stand up
I wrote back like Yeah baby sound like a plan
Still trying to play it cool sound like the man
But I was scared to death my nigga my stomach turned
Talking shit knowing damn well I was a virgin
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
You know that feelin when you you finna bone for the first time
Im hoping that she wont notice its my first time
Im hoping that my shit is big enough to fuck with
And most of all Im praying God dont let me bust quick
Im watching pornos trying to see just how to stroke right
Practice putting condoms on how it go right
Im in her crib now a nigga palms sweatin
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
Thats when my hands start touching and her face start blushing
And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbing
On me ooh girl dont stop
Pull out the condoms real smooth yeah just how I practiced
But right before I put it in she flinched and grabbed it and said
I wanna get something off my mental
I can tell you a pro but baby be gentle cause
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
And I aint never did this before no
