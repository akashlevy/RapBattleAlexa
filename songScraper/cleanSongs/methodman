I be like yiggy yes yall Doctor on call
Ill rock til my name in graffiti on the wall
Got flow like the rappers in Great George
Got weed I got blunt My name Jamal
I pause flick the ash from my L
I Pause like Run and Jason Mizell
The emcee is me host for the night
Papa Doc only thing I dont choke on the mic
I choke a bitch out if my gwap aint correct
Then with my giant hancock Ill get the cheque
I love trucks but droptops is the best
From the Beemers Benz now Rolex watch me
Haha she like Red so cool
Any nigga after me its a deja vu
Doc stay in the paint like AI shoes
Just watch how a one tonner made a move dig it
Hop in my truck and roll up the window
Ayo you know what you in for
Once we turn the corner light up the endo
Yes she with me getting low like a limbo
Roll with Gs and well show you how to get dough
Third degree let it burn with my kinfolk
Who these corner store rappers slinging cracks in my hall
Mamas in the kitchen cooking cat rat and dog
Me I want a little something yall could have it all
I tryna walk before I crawl and move this package in my draws
Thats why I push the pedal to the muhfuckin floor
With ten per cent method only plug something poor
and still I keep it funky like four plus one more
Get this money like In God We Trust trust your boy
Its a given living this life it was written
Especially for me Im what the recipe is missing
Blow my piff in the air key the ignition
Then get to lane switching plucking ashes off the clip and
Mammy wanna ride and play the Bonnie to my Clyde
If anybody try to Kill Bill itll probably be the bride
Like all jokes aside Im serious with mine
and now Im on this grind like Method Man in his prime
Yo I got my swagger on and I feel great
Funk Doc be in the hood like Enfamil cases
I network on MySpace real late
Hoping my album make me another Bill Gates
Around my crib look how I live
Im a slob but crip niggas say I get biz
Anywhere I did a show women saying that Im
Yeah another mic another night and the days end
Another heist another kite in the state pen
My state business shit yall dudes just break wind
New York nigga either youre made mice or made men
I do the dirt that keep my hand on the work
I got the other hand up Mona Lisas skirt
My aim one since day one stop
How many shots will it take to make son drop
Redman Repeat to end
Excuse me as I kiss the sky
Sing a song of six pence a pocket full a rye
Who the fuck wanna die for their culture
Stalk the dead body like a vulture
Blacker than your blackest stallion
I represent the Shaolin my nigga
Hell yes Apocalypse now the gun pow
It be goin down diggy diggy down diggy down down
While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
When I raise my trigga finga all yall niggaz hit the decks
Cause aint no need for that hustlers and hardcores
Raw to the floor raw like Reservoir Dogs
The Green Eyed Bandit cant stand it
With more Fruitier Loops then that Toucan Sam Bitch
Plus the Bombazee got me wild
Fuckin with us is a straight suicide
10 9 8 7 6 5 4
3 2 Murder 1 lyric at your door
Tical bring it to that assraw
Breakin all the rules like glassjaws
Nigga you got to get mine to getyours
Fucka we dont need no raptour
Id rather kick the facts and catch you with the rapture
More than you bargained for
Tical that stays open like an all night store
For real I keeps it ill like a piece of blue steel
Pointed at your temple with the intent to kill
And end your existance MET
Aint no use for resistance HOD
I bees the ultimate rush to any nigga on dust
The Egyptian Musk use to have me pull mad sluts
I shift like a clutch with the Ruck
Examine my nuts I dont stop till I get enough
Your shit broke down light your flare
Since the darkside tears you into hollywood squares
6 million ways to die so I chose
Made it 6 million and 1 with your eyes closed
The blindfold cold so you can feel the rap
And shatter the glass and second half on your monkey ass
And yo my man Tical hit me now
Bitches use to play me now they cant forget me now
Forget me not I rock the spot check glock
Empty off a lickin off a hip hop
Fuck the billboard Im a bullet on my block
How you dope when you payed for your billboard spot
Look up in the sky its a bird its a plane
Its the funk doctor spock smokin buddha on a train
HOW HIGH So high that I can kiss the sky
HOW SICK So sick that you can suck my dick
Look up in the sky its a bird its a plane
Recognize Johnny Blaze aint a damn thing changed
HOW HIGH So High that I can kiss the sky
HOW SICK So Sick that you can suck my dick
Till my man Raider Ruckus come home
It aint really on till the Ruckus get home
Puff a meth bone now Im off to the red zone
We dont need yo dirt weed we got our fuckin own
Check it I brings havoc with my hectic
Bring the Pain lyrics screamin for the antiseptic
Movin on your left kid and Im method out my fuckin dome piece
Plus I got no love for the beast
Hailin from the big East Coast
Home of the drug kingpins and cut throats
Hey boy yous the rude boy on the block you try and stop the bum rush you will get popped
As I run around with a racist
My style was born in the 50 stair cases
Dig it F a rap critic
He talk about it while I live it
If Red got the blunt Im the second one to hit it
Look up in the I got the verbs nouns and glocks in ya
Enter the centa lyrics bang like ricochet
Rabbit I brings havoc with an AK matic
Rollin blunts an all day habit
I get it on like Smiff and Wess
Punks take a sip and test
Im bombin you like Lebanon
Styles not to be fucked with or played with
Fuck the pretty hoes I love those Section A Bitches
Hittin switches Twistin wigs with
Phat radical mathematical type scriptures
I dig up in your planets like Digga
Boo scared you blew you to smithareens
Fuck the marines I got machines
To light the spit and read Mad magazine
I fly more heads than Continental
Wreck ya 5 times like US AIR off an instrumental
Look Im not a half way crook with bad looks
But I may murder your case like your name was Cal Brooks
I breaks em up proppa
Ask Biggie Smalls Who Shot Ya
Funk doctor with the 12 Gauge Mossberg
Look I got the tools like Rickle
To make your mind tickle
You aint gotta say no more man thats it
Word up Tical We Out
