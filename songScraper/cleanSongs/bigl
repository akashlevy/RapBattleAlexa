Big L bout ta get into some shit
Yo fuck all the glamours and glitz I plan to get rich
Im from New York and never was a fan of the Knicks
And Im all about expandin my chips
You mad cause I was in the van with your bitch
with both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne that you know in your heart
I got style plus the way that I be flowin is sharp
A while back I used to hustle sellin blow in the park
Countin G stacks and rockin ice that glow in the dark
Forever hottie huntin trigger temper Im quick to body somethin
You lookin at me like Im probably frontin
I fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest
Im older and smarter this is me at my best
I stopped hangin around yall cause niggaz like you
be prayin on my downfall hopin I flop
Hopin I stop you probably even hope I get locked
or be on the street corner with a pipe smokin the rock
I got more riches than you fuck more bitches than you
Only thing I havent got is more stitches than you
Fuckin punk you aint a Leader what Nobody Followed you
You was never shit your mother shoulda swallowed you
Mmmm WHOO You on some tagalong flunkie yes man shit
Do me a favor please get off the next man dick
And if you think I cant fuck with whoever put your money up
Put your jewels up no fuck it put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up nigga or shut your mouth up
before I buck lead and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red Im far from broke got enough bread
And mad hoes ask Beavis I get nuttin Butthead
laughter My game is vicious and cruel
Fuckin chicks is a rule
If my girl think Im loyal then that bitch is a fool
How come you can listen to my first album
and tell where a lot of niggaz got they whole style from
YEAH So what you actin for
You aint half as raw you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga sumun fore I crack his jaw
You runnin with boys Im runnin with men
Ima be rippin the mics until Im a hundred and ten
Have yall niggaz like Damnit this nigga done done it again
I throw slugs at idiots no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch eighthundred and fifty rocks
I dont fuck with none of you niggaz
I might pull out this gun on your niggaz
and rob every last one of you niggaz
Bobbito For somebody tired that wasnt that wasnt too badLyrics submitted by christian
I drive up and down Harlem blocks iced out watch
Knots in my socks cops think Im selling rocks
Pulling me over too see if Im drunk
but Im sober they wouldnt fuck with me if I drove a Nova
Listen Columbo youre mad because your money come slow
And what you make in a year I make in one show
Now you wanna frisk me and search my ride
Call me all kinda names try to hurt my pride
Youre just mad cause Im a young cat pockets dumb fat
Talkin bout where the gun at I been there and done that
Im through with that illegal life Im stayin legit
I love to see cars come cruisin bye and playin my shit
I walk around with six thou without a pistal my whole clicks wild
Im rich pal no more sticks Im makin hits now
I drink Cristal Im through breakin laws
I dont sell coke anymore I do tours
So get that flashlight out of my face
To bring me down them Jakesll do whatever it takes
Word up them federals got my phone and my house tapped
Praying that I fall for the mouse trap I doubt that
Why do I end up in so much shit
I done came way too far to be callin it quits
Jake wanna lock me up even though Im legit
They cant stand to see a young brother pockets get thick
Aiyyo enoughs enough federals try to set me up
Put me in cuffs and crush what I lust into dust
Plus they want a nigga sewed but they know
Big Joey Crack aint never rat a cat that he know
Fo sho death before dishonor I left the streets alone
since Tone deceased it almost killed his mama
So Ima keep doin what Im doin
Pursuin my dream til there enough cream to start my own union
And show these kids how legit it is
Shit is real I used to steal but now I own several businesses
So wheres your witness that you claim to have sayin that Im takin half
Extortin New York and not payin tax
Im layin back playin the role playin the low
But its the same ol Joe so dont get KOd
Hey yo Im gonna fry for what I never did
or catch a heavy bid why dont they just let a nigga live
if the vicious enemy suddenly started comin at you
armed to the teeth and ready to kill youLyrics submitted by mike
Let me get to the point real quick
When ya pockets are thick
mad chicks be on a brothers tip
When ya sportin jewels and drivin in a groovy car
all the hos go sweat you like a movie star
to get in ya pockets
thats what the girls wanna do
but if you not rich them chicks gonna front on you
no matter how strong your rap
you only nock boots when you got loot
you on the map
cause if you broke youll get a wack slut
if you got dough you get a ho with a fat butt
with fresh gearlong hair and a cute face
and if ya live alone shes gonna pack her suit case and move in
then ya start loosin all ya bucks
soon you broke as a joke and out of luck
then she takes off and brakes off
ya hos gone so long dear
Im outta here a good relationships been torn
Cause when you on top everythings OK
but when you broke you get no play
If you dont got endz you wont be gettin no skinz
And if you dont got money you wont skoop a honey
If you dont got cash you wont be gettin no ass
And if you dont got loot you wont be knockin no boots
Girls of the 90s aint nuthin but crooks
Its all about whats in ya pockets not how ya look
thats why you cant talk to just any whore
leavin brothers for the next man cause hes got a penny more
they want a drug dealer not a scholar
some girls barely speak but allways askin for a dollar
and if you pushin a fresh Benz theyll be ya best friends
yeah as long as you collect endz
you think shes all yours
but as soon as your dough go your ho go
but when you was makin papers sucker jumped hos
you bought dumb clothes for all of them bum hos
and you was takin em to the movies every weekend
now that you dead broke the girls not speakin
cause nowadays girls want you to crook
the only thing they can get from Big L is a big
Cause when you on top everythings OK
But when you broke you gets no play
I tell it how it is cause im a goldfigga
and I hate a money hungry girl aka golddigger
it aint even funny
some girls dont even know me askin me can they get some money
Im lookin nuthin like ya poppa
I wouldnt give a chick 10 cent to put cheese on a Whopper
they wanna know why im so fly
a girl ask me for a ring and i put one around her whole eye
Chicks used to diss but now they wanna kiss
Yo Showbiz Ima break it down like this
Its like that yall and thats a fact yall
I hit hoes from the back and dont give a jack yall
Its Big L yall Im livin swell yall
I do my famous spell my name ring bells yall
If you dont got endz
If you dont got endz
They aint givin up nuthin
If you dont got endz
all the girls they ignore you
If you dont got endz
they act like they never saw you
If you dont got endzLyrics submitted by Donte
Yeah its the Big L
Comin at you once again in ninefive
And I dedicate this one
to all my peoples from Uptown and everywhere
Yo where Im from it aint cookies and cream
Theres a lot of peer pressure growin up as a young teen
You never know when you gonna get wet
Cause mad clowns be catchin wreck with a tec just to get a rep
Instead of cool friends theyd rather hang with male thugs
Instead of goin to school theyd rather sell drugs
Its best to go the right route and not the wrong one
Because its gonna catch up witchu in the long run
Brothers be all up on us actin stupid gettin lifted
They life is twisted and most of them are quite gifted
In other words they got TALENT but theyd rather sell cracks
and bust gats and run the streets actin violent
To them its all about hittin skinz and makin some easy green
Cause thats all they show you on the TV screen
All they care about is a buck or bustin a sweet nut
They dont give a WHAT cause they street struck
You betta listen when L rhyme cause bein street struckll
get you nuttin but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme cause bein street struckll
get you nuttin but a bullet or jail time
Before the rap contract I was sellin crack
Stay strapped with a Mac I was into alla that
I started rappin and got nice as hell
If it wasnt for this I might be doin life in jail
And some of my peeps are still in the game sellin caine
If thats what you gotta do to maintain go head and do your thang
But with the cash profit make an investment
And try not to go to the grave like the rest went
Cause you can be rich with crazy loot own a house and nine cars
What good is that if youre dead or behind bars
And yo its not even funny
Ive seen a lot of my peers give up they careers for some fast money
They couldve been boxers ballplayers or rap singers
Instead they bank robbers and crack slingers
Aiyyo they used to be legit kids now they corrupt
They had dreams but gave em up cause they street struck
I still chill with my peeps in the streets but most of the time
Im in the crib writin rhymes to some dope beats
Or either callin up some freaks to bone
But word up I try to leave the streets alone
But its crazy hard kid in other words its spooky
The streets be callin me like the crack be callin Pookie
It aint a dumb joke listen to this young folk
Cause where Im from you can choke from the gunsmoke
Stay off the corners that might be your best plan
Before you catch a bullet that was meant for the next man
Or end up with a deep cut
Or relaxin on a hospital bed from bein street struck
Aiyyo take it from me the Big L
Cause I been through it all youknowhatImsayin
Stay off them corners youll stay out of trouble
And I gotta say rest in peace to all the cats teasin streets
Im outta hereLyrics submitted by Elias
