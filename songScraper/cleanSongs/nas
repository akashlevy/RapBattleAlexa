Pushin droptops Stacy Lattisaw tapes the 80s had us all apes
Youngest gorillas up to bat at home plate
That was a uncanny era guns in my pants
Yeah XClan hair with dreads at the top of my fade
Homicide and feds on the blocks where I played bball
Thats when I wondered was I here for the cause or because
Cause Ray Charles could see the ghetto
Was told to stay strong and I could beat the Devil
Cause yo I used to play Apollo balcony seats
Watchin niggaz swing razors in the front row then out in the streets
The car show 560s chemical afros
Acuras pumpin Super Lover Cee and Casanova
Live chicks be asses bustin out of they clothes
Wearin lip gloss big door knockers pealin they earlobes
So where them years go Where the old gold beers and cheers go
But now them shorties here doe so
The doo rags are back fitted hats snorkels and furs
Rikers Island bustin still packed whats the word
The drinkers stay drinkin or puffin they herb
And Im still enjoyin lifes ride one mo time
The doo rags are back fitted hats snorkels and furs
Rikers Island bustin still packed whats the word
The drinkers stay drinkin or puffin they herb
And Im still enjoyin lifes ride right
Political thugs in shark suits persuade us to pull triggers
in army boots yellin Join the armed forces
We lost the Vietnam War intoxicated poisons
Needles in arms of veterans instead of bigger fortunes
Theres still a lot of nigger callin in the coorporate offices
War in the ghetto we crabs in a barrel they torture us
They wont be servin the beast too long
The murderers wearin police uniforms confederate flags I burn
Beat Street breakers were dancin to the music I chose
And Peachtree Atlantic crackheads was tootin they nose
in frozen corners of Chicago loaded up Llamas children
We devil incarnates headed for jail
Where Shell gas company in South Africa be havin us killed
Your paper money was the death of Christ
And all these shorties comin up just resurrect your life
Niggaz used to wear rags on they hair when it was fried up
Thats when we were lied to buyin hair products
Back before my generation when our blackness started disintegratin
The styles come from prison they used potatoes makin liquor
just to prove we some creative niggaz
Turnin nothin into somethin is God work
And you get nothin without struggle and hard work
War is necessary to my niggaz in chains
From Greene to SingSing Im wantin yall to know one thing
The hardest thing is to forgive but God does
Even if you murdered or robbed yeah its wrong but God loves
Take one step toward him he takes two toward you
Even when all else fail God support you
I done it got God Son on my stomach
My heart and my lungs was affected from Hennys and gettin blunted
Do your body right and it loves you back
You only get one life and yo because of that
Im still blazin goin out for the cause
Still rockin stockin caps not for the waves obeyin no laws
Hate him or love him
Plus the people need someone to believe in
So in Gods Son we trust
Cause they know Im gonna give em what they want
They looking for a hero
I guess that makes me a hero
Another chapter of the cleanest rapper
Crooks and castle on his back
Holla atcha call me the chiropractor
Working like Muay Thai class
And of course Ive been the boss since back when
Rocking D Boy Fila velour in 190 black Benz
Now they shut down the stores when Im shopping
Used to be train robbing face covered in stocking
Come at me Ima rip your soliders in half
All black clothes til ice lay on me so classy
And every time I close my lids
I can still see the borough I can still see the Bridge
I can still see the dreams that my niqqas aint never lived to see
Tell them angels open the door for me
From nine berettas and moving raw
To chilling in wine cellars
Thats what I call mature
Thats what I call a g
Thats what I call a pimp
Thats what I call a gangsta
I try to make more cream
By every September 14th thats my dream
So I can be more clean as I grow yearly
I can see things more clearly
Thats why they fear me
Im hogtied the corporate side
Blocking yall from going to stores and buying it
First LA and Doug Morris was riding wit it
But Newsweek article startled big wigs
They said Nas why is he trying it
My lawyers only see the Billboard charts as winning
Forgetting Nas the only true rebel since the beginning
Still in musical prison in jail for the flow
Try telling Bob Dylan Bruce or Billy Joel
They cant sing whats in their soul
If Nas cant say it think about these talented kids
With new ideas being told what they can and cant spit
I cant sit and watch it
So sht Ima drop it
You aint gotta cop it
Im a hustler in the studio
No matter what the CD called
Im unbeatable yallLyrics submitted by Cem
Intro Nas Lauryn Hill singing in the background
Will it take me under I dont know
Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue behind my waters
No welfare supporters more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter nights are colder
Feeling like life is over these snakes strike like a cobra
The worlds hot my son got not evidently
Its elementary they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate knowledge
of coke was cooked without the garbage wed all have the top dollars
Designer clothes lacing your click up with diamond vogues
Your people holdin dough no parole
No rubbers go in raw imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
watch the blimp read The World Is Mine
If I ruled the world
Id free all my sons I love em love em baby
Could it be if you could
be mine wed both shine
If I ruled the world
Still livin for today in
these last days and times
The way to be paradise like relaxin black latino and anglosaxon
Cash Lost Tribe of Shabazz free at last
Brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa house is for the crew how we do
Trees for breakfast dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies historys told foul
But Im as wise as the old owl plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling click rollin
Trickin six digits on kicks and still holdin
Trips to Paris I civilized every savage
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisonner set free stress free
No work release purple M3s and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta ScottKing mayor the cities and reverse themes to Willies
It sounds foul but every girl I meet to go downtown
Id open every cell in Attica send em to Africa
If I ruled the world
Id free all my sons I love em love em baby
Could it be if you could
be mine wed both shine
If I ruled the world
Still livin for today in
these last days and times
And then well walk right up to the sun
Well walk right up to the sun
Well walk right up to the sun
Well walk right up to the sun
Youd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats heats mandatory
Runnin from Jake gettin chased hunger for papes
These are the breaks many mistakes go down out of state
Wait I had to let it marinate we carry weight
Tryin to get laced flip the ace stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cop camera
Makin moves in Atlanta back and forth scrambler
Cause you could have all the chips be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga havin shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it skys the limit
I push a Q45 Infinit
It wouldnt be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought Id never see but reality struck
Better find out before your times out what the fuck
If I ruled the world
Id free all my sons I love em em baby
Could it be if you could
be mine wed both shine
If I ruled the world
Still livin for today in
these last days and times
If I ruled the world if I ruled if I ruled
Id free all my sons if I ruled if I ruled
I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls black dimaonds
Could it be if you could
be mine wed both shine
If I ruled the world
Still livin for today in
these last days and times
If I ruled the world if I ruled
if I ruled Id free all my sons
black diamonds I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls if I ruled
If I ruled the world

They say we NI double GER we are
Much more still we choose to ignore
The obvious man this history dont acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we NI double GER we are
Much more but still we choose to ignore
The obvious we are the slave and the master
What you lookin for You the question and the answer
We trust no black leaders use the stove to heat us
Powdered eggs and government cheeses
The calendars with Martin JFK and Jesus
Gotta be fresh to go to school with fly sneakers
Schools with outdated books we are the forgotten
Summers coolin off by the fire hydrant
Yeah Im from the ghetto
Where old black women talk about their sugar level its not unusual
To see photos of dead homies funerals
Aluminium foil on TV antennas
Little TV sit on top the big TV eating TV dinners
Girls die their hair with KoolAid
They gave us lemons we made lemonade
But this niggers payed ancestral slaves
Descendant of kings its necessary I bling
Put rims on everything where tims on every scene
Do I mean it like a slave master nier
No Im gangsta gotta eat rappers
My abbreviation was young when I caught the cases
That should mean the court could see my changes take off the bracelets
Savers went broke smokes our diesel need no Bowflex
My chest still cut up like a bag of dope
Bought patterns consist of boss matters
Spit Moses lost commandments like a growth sandwich out my mouth
Toast to government cameras peepin us every week I must
Have my cars homes and phones squeaked for bugs
But this is what I was dreamin of
Between cuttin hard coke with new razors slicin my fingers up
They used to string us up we wanted everything
But the one bringin us cake be the snakes like the
Like the New Jack City wedding scene
No time for mistakes tryin to get it like Medellin
Verse 3 Over Chorus
My nig what up my nig Yep
But I always put myself in a sacrificial position
They been know I aint just rappin for fame
I got my old homie hasslin to father askin for chains
Yep I get it cash up this paper dont matter
They see me from skinny to fatter when I rap about war
They got a tendency to scatter they aint my backup no more
So now my enemies are at my front door
Cause anytime we mention our condition our history or existence
They callin it reverse racism
Still to this day the streets torn my brother Jung
Ill always have a seat for him not behind me beside me
Youll always know where to find me
They say the close ones will hurt you
So lets keep a small circle
On the road to riches and diamond rings
In the land of the blind the man with one eye is the king
