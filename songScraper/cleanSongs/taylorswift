I Was Riding Shotgun With Hair Undone In The Front Seat Of His Car
Hes Got A One Hand Feel On The Steering Wheel The Other On My Heart
I Look Around Turn The Raido Down He Says Baby Is Something Wrong
I Say Nothing I Was Just Thinking How We Dont Have A Song And He Says
Our Song Is The Slam Of Screan Doors
Sneaking Out Late Tapping On Your Window
When Were On The Phone And You Talk Real Slow
Cause Its Late And Your Mama Dont know
Our Song Is The Way You Laugh The First Date Man I Didnt Kiss Her When I Should Have
And When I Got Home Before I Said Amen Asking God If He Could Play It Again
I Was Walking Up The Front Porch Steps After Everything That Day
Had Gone All Wrong Had Been Trampled On And Lost Or Throne Away
Got To The Hallway Well On My Way To My Loving Bed
I Almost Didnt Notice All The Roses And The Note That Said
Our Song Is The Slam Of Screen Doors
Sneaking Out Late Tapping On Your Window
When Were On The Phone And You Talk Real Slow
Cause Its Late And Your Mama Dont Know
Our Song Is The Way You Laugh The First Date Man I Didnt Kiss Her When I Should Have
And When I Got Home Before I Said Amen Asking God If He Could Play It Again
Ive Heard Every Elbum Listend To The Raido
Waiting For Something To Come Along That Was As Good As Our Song
Cause Our Song Is The Slam Of Screen Doors
Sneaking Out Late Tapping On Your Window
When Were On The Phone And You Talk Real Slow
Cause Its Late And Your Mama Dont Know
Our SOng Is The Way You Laugh The First Date Man I Didnt Kiss Him When I Should Have
And When I got Home Before I said Amen Asking God If He Could Play It Agaiaiai ain Again Oh Yeah Oh Oh Yeah

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he wont see
That I want and Im needing
everything that we should be
Ill bet shes beautiful
that girl he talks about
And shes got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh cause its so damn funny
That I cant even see
anyone when hes with me
He says hes so in love
hes finally got it right
I wonder if he knows hes all I think about at night
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
dont know why I do
Drew walks by me
can he tell that I cant breathe
And there he goes
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
Shed better hold him tight
give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes
and know shes lucky cause
So I drive home alone
as I turn out the light
Ill put his picture down and maybe
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one whos got enough of me to break my heart
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
dont know why I do
Hes the time taken up
And hes all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me I fake a smile so he wont seeLyrics submitted by carly
It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes ah ah ah ah
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers ah ah ah ah
Were happy free confused and lonely at the same time
Its miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonights the night when we forget about the deadlines
I dont know about you
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You dont know about me
But Ill bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like were
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids ah ah ah ah
whos Taylor Swift anyway ugh
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Were happy free confused and lonely in the best way
Its miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonights the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
I dont know about you
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You dont know about me
But Ill bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like were
I dont know about you
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I dont know about you
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You dont know about me
But Ill bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like were
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart
Now why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Maybe I shouldve seen the sign
Shouldve read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say I still cant believe
That you would walk away it dont make sense to me
But why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart
Now why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
How do I get it back the way it was before
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart
Now why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break
Why would you wanna break a
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart
Now why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
I dont know what I want
Cause Im still trying to figure it out
Dont know whats down this road
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though Im not the only one who feels the way I do
Im alone on my own
And thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong
Oh but life goes on
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on my old blue jeans
And Im wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today got the sunshine
Can you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrows just a mystery oh yeah but thats okay
Im alone on my own
And thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong
Oh but life goes on
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Maybe Im just a girl on a mission but Im ready to fly
Im alone on my own
And thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong
Oh but life goes on
Oh Im alone on my own
And thats all I know
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Oh Im just a girl
Oh Im just a girl oh oh
Oh Im just a girl
I walked through the door with you the air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house
And you still got it in your drawer even now
Oh your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze
Were singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know its long gone
And that magics not here no more
And I might be okay
But Im not fine at all
Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were looking over me
Wind in my hair I was there I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsize bed
Your mothers telling stories about you on the tee ball team
You tell me about your past thinking your future was me
And I know its long gone
And theres nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there I remember it all to well
And maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up
Running scared I was there I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all all all too well
Time wont fly its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again but Im still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it cause you remember it all too well yeah
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair you were there you remember it all
Down the stairs you were there you remember it all
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well
People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you’ve changed
The more I think about it now
All I know is that you drove us
Hey all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Then why’d you have to go
And lock me out while I let you in
Hey now you say you want it back
Now that it’s just too late
Well could have been easy
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
Here you are now calling me up
But I don’t know what to stay
I’ve been picking off the pieces
Off the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
Hey all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Then why’d you have to go
And lock me out while I let you in
Hey now you say you want it back
Now that it’s just too late
Well could have been easy
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
This was what you wanted
You were all I wanted
Hey all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Then why’d you have to go
And lock me out while I let you in
Hey now you say you want it back
Now that it’s just too late
Well could have been easy
All you had to do was stay
Hey all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Then why’d you have to go
And lock me out while I let you in
Hey now you say you want it back

I’m so glad you made time to see me
How’s life tell me how’s your family
I haven’t seen them in a while
You’ve been good busier than ever
We small talk work and the weather your
Guard is up and I know why
Cause the last time you saw me is still burned in the
You gave me roses and I left them in the dark
So this is me swallowin my pride
standin in front of you saying I’m sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
it turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
wishin I ‘d realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days I haven’t been sleeping
stayin up playin back myself leavin
When your birthday passed and I didn’t call
Then I think about summer all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger’s side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love
And all I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swalloin my pride
standin in front of you sayin I’m sorry for that night
I go back to December all the time
turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missin you
wishin I’d realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin your sweet smile
so good to me so right
and how you held me in your arms that September night
the first time you ever saw me cry
maybe this is wishful thinking
but if we loved again
I swear I would love you right
Id go back in time and change it but I can’t
so if the chain is on your door
But this is me swalloin my pride
standin in front of you sayin im sorry for that night
And I go back to December…
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missin you
wishin I’d realized what I had when you were mine
I’d go back to December turn around and make it alright

Cause baby now we’ve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you’ve done
Cause baby now we’ve got bad blood hey
And I don’t think we can solve ‘em
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we’ve got bad blood hey
Did you have to do this
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shiny now it’s all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I’m weak baby I couldn’t breath
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you’re laughing right at me
Oh it so sad to think about the good times
Cause baby now we’ve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you’ve done
Cause baby now we’ve got bad blood hey
And I don’t think we can solve ‘em
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we’ve got bad blood hey
Did you think we’d we be fine
Still got scars on my back from your knives
So don’t think it’s in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won’t
So if you come in my way just don’t
Oh it’s so sad to think about the good times
Cause baby now we’ve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you’ve done
Cause baby now we’ve got bad blood hey
And I don’t think we can solve ‘em
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we’ve got bad blood hey
Band aids don’t fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that you live with ghosts
Band aids don’t fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that you live with ghosts
If you love like that blood runs bad
Cause baby now we’ve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you’ve done
Cause baby now we’ve got bad blood hey
And I don’t think we can solve ‘em
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we’ve got bad blood hey
Cause baby now we’ve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you’ve done
Cause baby now we’ve got bad blood hey
And I don’t think we can solve ‘em
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we’ve got bad blood hey
your beautiful eyes stare right into mine
and sometimes i think of you late at night
i wanna be somewhere where you are
your here your eyes are looking into mine
so baby make me fly
my heart has never felt this way before
Im looking through your eyes

in only a little while ill cry
so baby come hold me tight
i wanna be everything you need
your here your eyes are looking into mine
so baby make me fly
my heart has never felt this way before
im looking through your eyes
just as long as your mine
ill be your everything tonight
let me love you kiss you

Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didnt like it when I wore high heels
Turned the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didnt get this song
But I do I do
Walked in expecting youd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you dont know how nice that is
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last 8 months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
He said he never met one girl
Who had as many James Taylor records as you
We tell stories and you dont know why
Im coming off a little shy
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last 8 months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas and I wont talk about that
And for the first time whats past is past
Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last 8 months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

Ive got my big coat on
And look up smiling at you
Look now the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep
I dont know why all the trees change in the fall
I know youre not scared of anything at all
Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day
And dont know how my friends
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive
Until weve found a town
And we talk and windowshop
Until Ive forgotten all their names
I dont know who Im gonna talk to
I know Im laughing on the car ride home with you
Dont know how long its gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Hes better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And youre talking to me
Its the age of princesses and pirate ships
And youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine
And I didnt know if you knew
So Im taking this chance to say
That I had the best day
With you todayLyrics submitted by jackie
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Me for a little revenge
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along got him alone
And lets hear the applause
She took him faster and you could say sabotage
I never saw it coming
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
Shes not what you think
Shes better known for the things that she does on a mattress whoa
On the playground wont you many friends
She should keep in mind
she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge
She lives her life like its a party and shes on the list
She looks at me like Im a trend and shes so over it
I think her present frown is a little troubling and
She thinks Im psycho cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isnt what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Or they didnt teach you that in prep school
So its up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
Shes not what you think
Shes better known for the things that she does on a mattress whoa
On the playground wont you many friends
She should keep in mind
she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge
Im just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him but havent you heard
Im just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him but I always got the last word
Shes not what you think
Shes better known for the things that she does on a mattress whoa
On the playground wont you many friends
She should keep in mind
she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge
And do you still feel like you know what youre doing
Cause I dont you do oh
And do you still feel like you know what youre doing
I dont think you do I dont think you do
Cmon show me how much better you are
So you deserve some applause
Cause youre so much better
She took him faster and you could say sabotageLyrics submitted by KC de Casro
You held my hand and led me through the door
I know I always asked you for more
Youd give me everything just to see me smile
too bad you were only here for a little while
you taught me the difference between right and wrong
when mom and dad would fight youd tell me to be strong
i swear you told me you wouldnt be long
but im still waiting to see ur face again
my big sister is gone for now
please dont make me tell u how
theres no one to walk me back from school
no one to hold me and say boys suck girls rule
my big sister knew me right
she tucked me in every night
my big sister watch out for the car
my big sister i dont where u are
so tell me how do u expect me
to forgive u after u left me
i had to listen to the fights
with tears rolling down my eyesLyrics submitted by HoLlY
Nice to meet you where you been
I could show you incredible things
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love’s a game want to play
New money suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain’t it funny rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey let’s be friends
I’m dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it’s gonna be forever
Or it’s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it’s over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of exlovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
Cause we’re young and we’re reckless
We’ll take this way too far
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of exlovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
But I’ve got a blank space baby
And I’ll write your name
I could show you incredible things
You’re the king baby I’m your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come oh no
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
“Oh my God who is she”
I get drunk on jealousy
But you’ll come back each time you leave
Cause darling I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So it’s gonna be forever
Or it’s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it’s over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of exlovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
Cause we’re young and we’re reckless
We’ll take this way too far
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of exlovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
But I’ve got a blank space baby
And I’ll write your name
Boys only want love if it’s torture
Don’t say I didn’t say I didn’t warn ya
Boys only want love if it’s torture
Don’t say I didn’t say I didn’t warn ya
So it’s gonna be forever
Or it’s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it’s over
If the high was worth the pain

I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But its killing me to see you go after all this time
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Music starts playin like the end of a sad movie
Its the kinda ending you dont really wanna see
Cause its tragedy and itll only bring you down
Now I dont know what to be without you around
And we know its never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I cant breathe without you
Never wanted this never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
People are people and sometimes it doesnt work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
And we know its never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I cant breathe without you
Feelin like I just lost a friend
Hope you know its not easy easy for me
Feelin like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this aint easy easy for me
And we know its never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me
And I cant breathe without you
Im sorry Lyrics submitted by carmelacapada
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But its killing me to see you go after all this time
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

And it’s a sad picture the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it’s all the same another time and place
Repeating history and you’re getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I’ll do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
And we’ll sing hallelujah we’ll sing hallelujah
It’s hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
Find things they never found
But we’re faster and never scared
You can walk away say we don’t need this
But there’s something in your eyes
Says we can beat this
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
And we’ll sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah
Tonight we stand get off our knees
Fight for what we’ve worked for all these years
And the battle was long it’s the fight of our lives
But we’ll stand up champions tonight
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It’s a revolution throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And we sang hallelujah we sang hallelujah
And its a sad picture the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again
You know its all the same another time and place
Repeating history and youre getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And Ill do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
We sing hallelujah we sing hallelujah
Its hard to fight when the fight aint fair
Find things they never found
But were faster and never scared
You can walk away say we dont need this
But theres something in your eyes
Says we can beat this
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
We sing hallelujah we sing hallelujah
Tonight well stand get off our knees
Fight for what weve worked for all these years
And the battle was long its the fight of our lives
And well stand up champions tonight
It was the night things changed
Do you see it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
Its a revolution throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And well sing hallelujah we sang hallelujah
What if ribbons and bows didnt mean a thing
Would the song still survive without 5 golden rings
Would you still want a kiss without a mistletoe
What would happen if god never let it snow
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie
Tell me what would you find
You see that today called something special something holy not superficial so heres to the birthday boy who saved our lives Something that we all tried to ignore and put a wreath upon your door Heres something you should know that is for sure Christmas must be something more
What if angels did not pay attention to all the things that we wish they would always do
What if happiness came in a cardboard box then i think thats something that we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away
Tell me what you would find
We get so caught up in all of it
and its the time of the year and everybodys here its the last thing on your mind
Is that the day called something special something holy not superficial
So heres the day that Christ has saved our lives
its something that we all tried to ignore and put a wreath upon your door
and heres something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more
theres got to be more
got to be moreLyrics submitted by Angel
Please take down the mistletoe
Cause I dont wanna think about that right now
Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
Mamas in the kitchen worrying about me
Seasons greetings hope youre well
Im doin alright if you were wondering
Lately I can never tell
I know this shouldnt be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine
Ive been doing fine without you really
Up until the nights got cold
Everybodys here except you baby
Seems like everyones got someone to hold
But for me its just a lonely time
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
Thatll have to be something I just say this year
Bet you got your mom another sweater
Were you cousins late again
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands
I know this shouldnt be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didnt
Wonder how you are tonight
Cause there were Christmases when you were mineLyrics submitted by Hannah
The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we’d grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth
You still all over me
Like a winestained dress I can’t wear anymore
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm
The rain came pouring down
That’s when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you
And I think I am finally clean
There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust
They covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs
But no one heard a thing
The rain came pouring down
That’s when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean
Said I think I am finally clean
Ten months sober I must admit
Just because you clean don’t mean you don’t miss it
Ten months older I won’t give in
Now that I’m clean I’m never gonna risk it
The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we’d grown together died of thirst
The rain came pouring down
That’s when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
The rain came pouring down
That’s when I could finally breathe
And by morning gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean
Think I am finally clean
Im like 8 foot 4 blonde hair to the floor your shawtys never thought I dreamed about rappin hardcore

WHAT WHAT I KNIT SWEATERS YO WHAT WHAT DONT EST ME bleep
Hold on hold on I didnt even say anything what I said yo yo you guys bleeped me and I didnt even swear she didnt even swear Hello
You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take you take the very best of me
So I start a fight because I need to feel something
You do what you want because Im not what you wanted
What a raining ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away no used to fulling words that you will never say
Now that Im sitting here thinking it through
I never been anywhere cold as you
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of grey
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with a nerve to adore you
What a raining ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away no use to fulling words that you will never say
Now that Im sitting here thinking it through
I never been anywhere cold as you
You never did give a damn baby honey
But I cry cry for you
And I know you wouldnt tell nobody
If I die die for you
What a raining ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you make is so condescending
counting all the scars you made
Now that Im sitting here thinking it through
I never been anywhere cold as youLyrics submitted by Amy Venusio
You said it in a simple way
4 AM the second day
How strange that I dont know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall
I told myself dont get attached
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess youre in New York today
I dont wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what Id known now
I never would have played so nonchalance
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I cant help but wish you took me with you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess youre in London today
I dont wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you and you are worlds away
But youre in London and I break down
Cause its not fair that youre not around
This is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess youre in New York today
And I dont wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here
I could go back to every laugh
But I dont wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I dont wanna go there anymore
Talk to the wind talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
Ill leave my window open
Cause Im too tired at night to call your name
Just know Im right here hopen
That youll come in with the rain
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I dont wanna have to go that far
And I Ive got you down
I know you by heart
And you dont even know where I start
Talk to yourself talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And dont wait for the sky to clear
Ill leave my window open
Cus Im too tired at night to call your name
Oh just know Im right here hopen
That youll come in with the rain
Ive watched you so long
I dont know what else I can say
But Ill leave my window open
Cus Im too tired at night for all these games
Just know Im right here hopen
That youll come in with the rain

Id never gone with the wind
Let it take me where it wants to go
Til you open the door
Ive never seen it before
I was trying to fly
But I couldnt find wings
But you came along and you changed everything
You lift my feet off the ground
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like Im falling and I
Im lost in your eyes
You make me crazier crazier crazier
I watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldnt see
And you made me believe
You lift my feet off the ground
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like Im falling and I
Im lost in your eyes
You make me crazier crazier crazier
Baby you showed me what living is for
I dont wanna hide anymore
You lift my feet off the ground
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like Im fallin and I am lost in your eyes

He said I got me a nice new apartment
Wouldnt you have hated that
Im getting by with the broken heart you left me with
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Wont you come back to me
He was lying when he said he moved to LA
Hes just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands
and shes just 7 miles away
Hes staring out the window and puts her picture down saying
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Wont you come back to me
She almost called him on the night that he wrote
these simple words on his goodbye note
Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Wont you come back to me
In dark blue TennesseeLyrics submitted by rosa betenbaugh
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Praying the floor won’t fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin’ which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well I stopped pickin’ up and this song is to let you know why
Dear John I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home I shouldve known
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it’s you and your sick need
To give love then take it away
And youll add my name to your long list of traitors who dont understand
And Ill look back in regret how I ignored when they said
Run as fast as you can
Dear John I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home
Dear John I see it all now it was wrong
Don’t you think nineteen’s too young
To be played by your dark twisted games
When I loved you so I shouldve known
You are an expert at Sorry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that youve run dry have tired lifeless eyes
Cause youve burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
Over your sad empty town
Dear John I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home
I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song you should’ve known
Don’t you think I was too young
There I was again tonight
Same old tired lonely place
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered Have we met
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
The lingering question kept me up
2 AM who do you love
I wonder til Im wide awake
And now Im pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
Id open up and you would say Hey
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck dancing around all alone
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waiting on you
Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waiting on you
This night is sparkling dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck dancing around all alone
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waiting on you
duet with Ed Sheeran
All I knew is the morning when I woke
Is I know something now something now I didnt before
And all Ive seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles in your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel right
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you know you know you
Cause all I know is we said Hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know its simple aint it Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
Youll be mine and Ill be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
And all my walls stand tall painted blue
And Ill take them down take them down and open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind making up for lost time
Taking flight making me feel right
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you better know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you know you know you

I just wanna know you know you know you
Cause all I know is we said Hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know its simple aint it Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door

Is I know something now something now I didnt before

All I know is the new found grace
All my days I know your face
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed
Is yesterday we were just children
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards winning battles with our wooden swords
But now weve stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Everybodys waiting for you to breakdown
Everybodys watching to see the fallout
Even when youre sleeping sleeping
So here you are two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought youd make it this far
But turn around oh theyve surrounded you
Its a showdown and nobody comes to save you now
But youve got something they dont
Yeah youve got something they dont
Youve just gotta keep your eyes open
Everybodys waiting for you to breakdown
Everybodys watching to see the fallout
Even when youre sleeping sleeping
Everybodys waiting for you to breakdown
Everybodys watching to see the fallout
Even when youre sleeping sleeping
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes openLyrics submitted by Lily Willams
Theres somethin bout the way
The street looks when its just rained
Theres a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Were drivin down the road
I wonder if you know
Im tryin so hard not to get caught up now
But youre just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly makin me want you
And I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress
Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passengers seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it remember it
And I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress
Well you stood there with me in the doorway
Im not usually this way but
You pull me in Im a little more brave
Its the first kiss its flawless really something its
And I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress
FearlessLyrics submitted by talyah tignor
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
Its the morning of your very first day
You say Hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybodys way
Its your freshman year and youre gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I havent seen you around before
Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Feeling like theres nothing to figure out
Well count to ten take it in
This is life before you know who youre gonna be
You sit in class next to redheaded Abigail
And soon enough youre best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think theyre so cool
Well be out of here as soon as we can
And then youre on your very first date and hes got a car
And youre feeling like flying
And your mammas waiting up
And youre thinking hes the one
And youre dancing round the room when the night ends when the night ends
Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
And when youre fifteen and your first kiss makes your head spin around
But in your life youll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team
But I didnt know it at fifteen
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind
Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
And when youre fifteen dont forget to look before you fall
Ive found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who youre supposed to be
I didnt know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye
And told me you loved me
Cause it seems to me this thing is breaking down
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect now youre half way out the door
And I stare at the phone
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
Made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now Im not so sure
That cuts me to the core
Thought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore
And I stare at the phone
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didnt mean it baby
Back up baby back up
Back up baby back up
Cause it rains in your bedroom
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Oh I stare at the phone
And then you feel so low
You cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didnt mean it baby
You said forever and always yeah
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down we almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now youre half way out the door
And I stare at the phone
And then you feel so low
You cant feel nothing at all
When he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
It rains when youre here

I was there when you said forever and always
Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew for a minute now Im not so sure
So heres to everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Thought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore
And I stare at the phone
And then you feel so low
You cant feel nothing at all
When he said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
It rains when youre here
And it rains when youre gone

Ill be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on
Im just a girl trying to find a place in
got the radio on my old blue jeans
and Im wearing my heart on my sleeve
feeling lucky today got the sunshine
could you tell me what more do I need
and tomorrows just a mystery oh yeah
maybe Im just a girl on a mission
but Im ready to fly
REPEAT CHORUSLyrics submitted by kayla
Dont look at me youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
Dont look at me youve got a girl at home
I dont even know her
But I feel responsibility to do whats upstanding and right
Its kind of like a code yeah
And youve been getting closer and closer and crossing so many lines
And it would be a fine proposition if I was a stupid girl
But honey I am no ones exception
This I have previously learned
So dont look at me youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
Dont look at me youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
And I see you turn off your phone
And now youve got me alone
Dont look at me youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
I just wanna make sure you understand perfectly
Youre the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up you chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have
And it would be a fine proposition if I was a stupid girl
And yeah I might go with it if I hadnt once been just like her
Dont look at me youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
Dont look at me youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
And I see you turn off your phone
And now youve got me alone
Dont look at me youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Call a cab lose my number
Youre about to lose your girl
Call a cab lose my number
Lets consider this a lesson learned
Dont look at me youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
Dont look at me youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
When I see you pick up your phone
And tell her youre coming home
Dont look at me youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
Dont look at me youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
It would be a fine proposition if I hadnt once been just like herLyrics submitted by Samantha
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
but I never thought Id live to see it break
Its getting dark and its all too quiet
And I cant trust anything now
And its coming over you like its all a big mistake
Oh Im holding my breath
somethings made your eyes go cold
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back now Im haunted
Stood there and watched you walk away
But I still mean every word I said to you
He would try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time Im wishing he was you instead
Oh Im holding my breath
something keeps me holding on to nothing
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back now Im haunted
I know I know I just know
Youre not gone You cant be gone No
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Wont finish what you started
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant go back Im haunted
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought Id see it break
Never thought Id see it
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
I didnt say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
Ill be the one waiting there even when its cold
Boy you might have me believing
I dont always have to be alone
Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself
Ive been holding back this feeling
So Ive got some things to say to you ha
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk way you talk way you say my name
Its beautiful wonderful dont you ever change
Why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same
Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself
Theyre dimming the street lights
Youre perfect for me why arent you here tonight
Im waiting alone now so come on and come out
And pull me near to shine shine shine
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
But would they write a song for you
I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself
If you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and Lord it took me away
Back to a firstglance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light go
Hey skip the conversation and you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we’d made
And that was the first day
And darling it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of ‘I need you’
And for the first time I had something to lose
Well I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story’s got dust on every page
Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd
Cause darling it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground
Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you
Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in the next room
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you
It was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground
Tonight I’m gonna dance for all that we’ve been through
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you
Tonight I’m gonna dance like you were in the next room
But I don’t wanna dance if I’m not dancing with you
Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain rain
She’ll open up the door
And say “are you insane ane”
See it’s been a long six months
And you were too afraid
To tell her what you want want
And that’s how it works
That’s how you get the girl
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart I’ll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that’s how it works
It’s how you get the girl girl
And that’s how it works
It’s how you get the girl girl
Remind her how it used to be be
Of kisses on cheeks cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind
When you left her all alone
And never told her why why
And that’s how it works
That’s how you lost the girl
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart I’ll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that’s how it works
It’s how you get the girl girl
And that’s how it works
It’s how you get the girl girl
That I don’t want you to go
Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart I’ll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that’s how it works
It’s how you get the girl girl
And that’s how it works
It’s how you get the girl girl
And that’s how it works
It’s how you get the girl girl
And that’s how it works
It’s how you get the girl girl
It’s how you got the girl
I bet this time of night youre still up
I bet youre tired from a long hard week
I bet youre sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know every time I dont
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Cuz each time you reach out theres no reply
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I cant say hello to you
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I dont
Oh we made quite a mess babe
Its probably better off this way
In my dreams youre touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I dont
I bet this time of night youre still up
I bet youre tired from a long hard week
I bet youre sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me
Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But its something I just fell into
just look what Ive created
I came out alive but Im black and blueue
Before you ask me if Im alright
Think about what I
Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart put on my makeup
Another mess I didnt plan
And Ill bet you thought youd beat me
Wish you could only see
Ive got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand
Id be fine if you just walked by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right
But I cant believe you made me
Sit at home cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night
And now you ask about you and I
Theres no you and I
Remember what you put me through
Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart put on my makeup
Another mess I didnt plan
And Ill bet you thought youd beat me
I wish youd could only see
I got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand
And when youre home alone at night
Why you took everything I had oh baby
and now youthink about you and I
Theres no you and I
Wake up and smell the breakup
Realize that we wont makeup
It didnt go the way you planned
And youll know you didnt beat me
When you look down and see

Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights you got me alone
You found me you found me you found me
I guess you didnt care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me without me without me
And hes long gone when hes next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down
Oh I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
No apologies hell never see you cry
Pretends he doesnt know that hes the reason why
Youre drowning youre drowning youre drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all Ill ever be
And now I see now I see now I see
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
And the saddest fear comes creepin in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
You stand with your hand on my waistline
It’s a scene and we’re out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It’s a bad sign bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling in dark clouds
Love’s a fragile little flame
It could burn out it could burn out
Cause they got the cages
They got the boxes and guns
We are the foxes and we run
Baby I know places we won’t be found
And they’ll be chasing their tails
Trying to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
I know places I know places
Lights flash and we’ll run for the fences
Let them say what they want we won’t hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
And don’t ever drop it my love
We are the foxes and we run
Baby I know places we won’t be found
And they’ll be chasing their tails
Trying to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
We are the foxes and we run
And don’t ever drop it my love
Baby I know places we won’t be found
And they’ll be chasing their tails
Trying to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
They take their shots we’re bulletproof
And you know for me it’s always you
In the dead of night you act so brave
And I know for you it’s always me
It’s 2am in your car
Windows down past my street the memories start
You say it’s in the past
You thinking that I hate you now
Cause you still don’t know what I never said
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here right now
It’s all good I wish you would
It’s 2am in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
It’d makes you turn right back around
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here right now
It’s all good I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad any more
I wish you were right here right now
It’s all good I wish you would
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood
I wish you would I wish you would
I wish you would I wish you would
See your face hear my voice in the dark
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here right now
It’s all good I wish you would
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I will never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here right now
It’s all good I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
I wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad any more
I wish you were right here right now
It’s all good I wish you would
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood
I wish you would I wish you would
I wish you would I wish you would
I dont think that passengers seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
I count the colors in his eyes
Hed never fall in love he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
Im laughing cause I hope hes wrong
And I dont think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs
And I can tell you
He got his fathers eyes
And if you ask me if I love him
He looks around the room
Shouldnt a light go on
Doesnt he know that I had him memorized for so long
He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I dont let nobody see me wishing he was mine
He stands there and walks away
My God if I could only say
Im holding every breath for you
And hed never tell you
But he can play guitar
I think he can see through
First thought when I wake up
Is my God Hes beautiful
So I put on my makeup
And pray for a miracle
Yes I could tell you
Oh and it kills me
He has his fathers eyes
And if you ask me if I love him
And if you ask me if I love him
Id lieLyrics submitted by Cassie Kraemer
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
Sometimes we dont say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I dont wanna live without you
Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half Im only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me when Im with you
Just a smalltown boy and girl
Living in the crazy world
Trying to figure out what is and isnt true
And I dont try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you cant live without me
Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half Im only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me when Im with you
When Im with anybody else
Its so hard to be myself
And only you can tell
Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half Im only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me when Im with you
Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and Im still reaching
Even though I know youre not here
I was playing back a thousand memories baby
Thinkin bout everything weve been through
Maybe ive been going back too much lately
Time stood still and I had you
Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie youd be here by now
Like you could you could if you just said youre sorry
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
Cos nothing like this ever happened to them
Now Im pacing down the hall
Flashback to a night when you said to me
Nothings gonna change not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose
Come back come back come backLyrics submitted by SarahTaylor

Guess you really did it this time
Left yoruself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tight rope
Lost your mind trying to get it back
Wasnt it easier in your lunchbox days
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasnt it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you
Its all right just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh who you are is not where youve been
Did some things you cant speak of
But tonight you live it all again
You would be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then
Wasnt it easier in your firefly catching days
When everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you
Wasnt it beautiful running wild til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you
Its alright just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh who you are is not where youve been
Its okay life is a tough crowd
Thirty two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
Time turns flames to embers
Every one of us has messed up too
Minds change like the weather
Today is never too late to be brand new
Its all right just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh who you are is not where youve been
Its okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growin up now
Who you are is not what you did
Lost your balance on the tightrope
Its never too late to get backLyrics submitted by Robyn
She can’t see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She’ll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can’t see me wantin you the way you want her
But you are everything to me
I just wanna show you
She don’t even know you
Shes never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Instead of just invisible
There’s a fire inside of you
That can’t help but shine through
She’s never gonna see the light
No matter what you do
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be
Like shadows in a faded light
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize
I just wanna show you
She don’t even know you
Baby let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Instead of just invisible
She can’t see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
I like the way you sound in the morning
We’re on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound I have ever heard
I like the way I can’t keep my focus
I watch you talk you didn’t notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
Every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine I’ll shine for you
Whoa oh I’m feeling you baby
Don’t be afraid to jump then fall jump then fall into me
Baby never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
So I’ma stay through it all
Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You’ve got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face
Oh I I‘ve never been so wrapped up
I like the way you’re everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it all over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me
Cause every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine I’ll shine for you
Whoa oh I’m feeling you baby
Don’t be afraid to jump then fall jump then fall into me
Baby never gonna leave you say that you wanna be with me too
So I’ma stay through it all
The bottom’s gonna drop out from under our feet
I’ll catch you I’ll catch you
And people say things that bring you to your knees
The time is gonna come when you’re so mad that you could cry
But I’ll hold you through the night until you smile
And whoa oh I need you baby
And don’t be afraid please jump and fall jump then fall into me
Baby I’m never gonna leave you

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears Ill give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me
Well its been a year It doesnt surprise me
Merry Christmas I wrapped it up and sent it
with a note saying I Love You
Now I know what a fool Ive been
but if you kiss me now
I know youll fool me again
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears Ill give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears Ill give it to someone special
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
Im hiding from you and your soul of eyes
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face of a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
May be this year maybe this year
Ill give it to someone special
Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears Ill give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears Ill give it to someone special
It wont be anything like anything like
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears Ill give it to someone specialLyrics submitted by Paige
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 158
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away
I do recall now the smell of the rain
I ran off the plane
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms
But now Ill go sit on the floor
All that I know is
I dont know how to be something you miss
I never thought wed have a last kiss
Never imagined wed end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party youre showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
Im not much for dancing
But for you I did
Because I love your handshake meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
Theres not a day I dont miss those rude interruptions
And Ill go sit on the floor
All that I know is
I dont know how to be something you miss
Never thought wed have a last kiss
Never imagined wed end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips
So Ill watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope its nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines
And its a beautiful day
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind
So Ill go sit on the floor
All that I know is
I dont know how to be something you miss
Never thought wed have a last kiss
Never imagined wed end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Found myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better
Right before your eyes
I’m breaking no past
Just you and me
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
When right before your eyes
I’m aching run fast
Just you and me…
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye…
This is the last time you tell me I’ve got it wrong
This is the last time I say it’s been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time I won’t hurt you anymore
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
This is the last time I’m asking you this this is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name on the top of your list name on the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why this is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye You break my heart…
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Time I’m asking you this
Time I’m asking you this
Time I’m asking you this
I said remember this moment in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds and stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the sidelines wishing for right now
We are the Kings and the Queen
You trade your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we help them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming this is absurd
Cause for a moment a band of theives
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment promise me this
That youll stand by my forever
But if god forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how our hope it shined
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life with you
Long long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be rememberedLyrics submitted by millie
We were both young when I first saw you
On a balcony in summer air
See the party the ball gowns
I see you make your way through the crowd
And say hello little did I know
That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please dont go and I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say yes
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause were dead if they knew
Escape this town for a little while
Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please dont go and I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say yes
Romeo save me they try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but its real
Dont be afraid well make it out of this mess
Its a love story baby just say yes
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you is fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said
Romeo save me Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said marry me Juliet
Youll never have to be alone
I love you and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
Its a love story baby just say yes
Cause we were both young when I first saw youLyrics submitted by miaperez

When I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights see the party the ball gowns
I see you make your way through the crowd and say Hello
And my Daddy said STAY AWAY FROM JULIET
And I was crying on the staircase begging you PLEASE DONT GO
CHORUS
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
And Ill be the princess
Baby just say Yes
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cuz were DEAD if they knew

And my Daddy said STAY AWAY FROM JULIET
But you were everything to me
I was begging you PLEASE DONT GO

Theyre trying to tell me how to feel
Well make it out of this mess

New to town with a made up name in the angel city
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties’ queen
Another name goes up in lights like diamonds in the sky
And they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
Yeah they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now you’re the lucky one
Now it’s big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you’re lucky
Cause you don’t feel pretty you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place
Another name goes up in lights You wonder if you’ll make it out alive
And they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
Yeah they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
Can you tell me now you’re the lucky one oh oh oh
It was a few years later I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square
And it took some time but I understand it now
‘Cause now my name is up in lights but I think you got it right
Let me tell you now you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now you’re the lucky one oh oh oh
And they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
Yeah they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
And they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh
Theres a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever never say never
You could do better thats what she says
Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket she dances in spite
Of the fact that shes different
And yet shes the same
And she says lucky you lucky you
She sings her little song she walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies
Left to travels lives they unravel
Mind over matter thats what she says
Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket she dances in spite
Of the fact that shes different
And yet shes the same
And she says lucky you lucky you lucky you
Maybe shell sing you do do do do
Maybe shell bring you into the skies
Honey shell love you funny how some view
Angels above you aint so far away
Mama named her lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket she dances in spite
Of the fact that shes different
And yet shes the same
And she says lucky you lucky you
she said i ws sseven and you wee nine
i looked at you like the stars that shined
in the sky the pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
growing up and falling in love and mamas smiled
and rolled their eyes and said oh my my my
take me back to the house in the backyard tree
said youd beat me up you were bigger than me
you never did you never did
take me back when our world was one block wide
i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
just two kids you and i
oh my my my my
i was sixteen when suddenly
i wasnt that little girl you used to see
but your eyes still shined like pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
they never believed wed really fall in love
and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
and said oh my my my
take me back to the creek beds we turned up
two am riding in you truck and all i need is you next to me
take me back to the time we had our very first fight
the slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
you stayed outside till the morning light
oh my my my my
a few years had gone and come around
we were sitting at our favorite spote in town
and you looked at me got down on one knee
take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
our whole town came and our mamas cried
you said i do and i did too
take me home where we met so many years before
well rock our babies on that very front porch
after all this time you and i
ill be eightyseven youll be eightynine
ill still look at you like the stars that shine
in the sky oh my my myLyrics submitted by kayla
You with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like Im nothing
You with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when Im wounded
You picking on the weaker man
You can take me down with just one single blow
But you dont know what you dont know
Someday Ill be living in a big ol city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean
You with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I dont already see them
I walk with my head down
Trying to block you out cause Ill never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again
I bet you got pushed around
But the cycle ends right now
Cause you cant lead me down that road
And you dont know what you dont know
Someday Ill be living in a big ol city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I cant sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar and pathetic and alone in life
And mean and mean and mean and mean
But someday Ill be living in a big ol city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean yeah
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so
Someday Ill be living in a big ol city Why you gotta be so
And all youre ever gonna be is mean Why you gotta be so
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me Why you gotta be so
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean
You were in college working part time waiting tables
Left a small town never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin’
Wonderin’ why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say can you believe it
As we’re lyin’ on the couch
The moment I can see it
Yes yes I can see it now
Do you remember we were sittin’ there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine
Flash forward and we’re taking on the world together
And there’s a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I’m guarded
You say we’ll never make my parents’ mistakes
But we’ve got bills to pay
We’ve got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes yes this is what I thought about
Do you remember we were sittin’ there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine
And I remember that fight 230am
As everything was slippin’ right out of our hands
I ran out cryin’ and you followed me out into the street
Brace myself for the goodbye cause that’s all I’ve ever known
And you took me by surprise
You said I’ll never leave you alone
I remember how we felt sittin’ by the water
And every time I look at you it’s like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man’s careful daughter
She is best thing that’s ever been mine
Hold on you’ll make it last
Hold on never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine
Hold on do you believe it
Hold on We’re gonna make it now
Hold on I can see it
Yeah yeah I can see it nowLyrics submitted by Kate Maher
Shouldve burst through the door
With that baby Im right here smile
And it wouldve felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I wouldve been so happy
Ive got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how Ive been as I comb back through my memory
How you said youd be here
You said youd be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
As Im looking around the room
But theres one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know when theres something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
He said hed be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
And asking me about you
But theres one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
What do you say when tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know
And what do you do when the one who means the most to you
is the one who didnt show
And I wouldve been so happy
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
And theyre all standing around me singing
But theres one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
And say Im sorry I didnt make it
And I said Im sorry too
And that was the moment I knewLyrics submitted by Ariana Olvera
Your little hands wrapped around my finger
And its so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause youre dreaming
So I tuck you in turn on your favorite night light
To you everythings funny you got nothing to regret
Id give all I have honey
If you could stay like that
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up just stay this little
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up it could stay this simple
I wont let nobody hurt you wont let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up never grow up
Youre in the car on the way to the movies
And youre mortified your moms dropping you off
At 14 theres just so much you cant do
And you cant wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But dont make her drop you off around the block
Remember that shes getting older too
And dont lose the way that you dance around in your pjs getting ready for school
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up just stay this little
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up it could stay this simple
No ones ever burned you nothings ever left you scarred
And even though you want to just try to never grow up
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps remember the words said
And all your little brothers favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city they just dropped me off
Its so much colder that I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
Wish Id never grown up
I wish Id never grown up
Oh I dont wanna grow up wish Id never grown up
I could still be little
Oh I dont wanna grow up wish Id never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up just stay this little
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up it could stay this simple
Wont let nobody hurt you
Wont let no one break your heart
And even though you want to please try to never grow up
Oh dont you ever grow up
Oh never grow up just never grow up
We’re all bored we’re all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren’t coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me mine is better
We’re so young but we’re on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what we’re doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey life is just a class room
Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And everyday is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby we’re the new romantics
Come come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We’re too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby we’re the new romantics
The best people in life are free
We’re all here the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back it’s all in the timing
It’s poker you can’t see it in my face
But I’m about to play my ace
We need love but all we want is danger
We team up and switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey most of them are true
Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And everyday is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby we’re the new romantics
Come come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We’re too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby we’re the new romantics
The best people in life are free
So come come along with me
The best people in life are free
Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
It’s so romantic it’s so romantic
Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And everyday is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And everyday is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby we’re the new romantics
Come come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We’re too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby we’re the new romantics
The best people in life are free
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said This time Ive had enough
And youve called a hundred times
But Im not picking up
Cause Im so mad I might tell you that its over
But if you look a little closer
I say leave but all i really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
and me and my stupid pride were sittin here alone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread
So baby if you know everything
Tell me why you couldnt see
That when I left I wanted you to chase after me
Yeah I say leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
And Ill scream out the window
I cant even look at you
I dont need you but I do I do I do
I say theres nothing you can say
To make this right again
I mean it I mean it what I mean is
I say leave but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carry me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying was she worth this mess

After everything I must confess I need youLyrics submitted by Mackenzie

We were standing in an empty room
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I could have spent a life with you
But those days were over
You were calling my name when your face faded from view
And wasnt it you who told me the sun would always chase the day
And wasnt it you who told me
Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasnt it just like swimming out on the lake
And stars collide and the airs alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
I remember waking up with you
You meant more to me then than I think you ever knew
But you were gonna be a doctor movie star
A poet at a Nobel seminar
I hope the world never tore that out of you
Cause wasnt it you who told me the sun would always chase the day
Yeah wasnt it you who told me
Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasnt it just like swimming out on the lake
And stars collide and the airs alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
And what ever happened to the things you loved
And the songs we played and the indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away
Like Harold and Maude and singing
Like Harold and Maude and singing
I was waving as you drove away
You were writing backwards in a dusty window pane
Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasnt it just like swimming out on the lake
And stars collide and the airs alive
Or was it just like those promises that you made
On our last nightLyrics submitted by Rachel
In the front seat of his car
Hes got a onehand feel
The other on my heart
I look around turn the radio down
He says Baby is something wrong
How we dont have a song
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late tapping on your window
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date Man I didnt kiss her when I should have
And when I got home fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
And lost and thrown away
And the note that said
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late tapping on your window
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date Man I didnt kiss her when I should have
And when I got home fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Ive heard every album listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song
Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late tapping on his window
When were on the phone and he talks real slow
cause its late and his mama dont know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date Man I didnt kiss him when I should have
And when I got home fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
In the front seat of his car
And I wrote down our song Lyrics submitted by Angelica Besite
In the front seat of his car
Hes got a onehand feel
The other on my heart
I look around turn the radio down
He says Baby is something wrong
How we dont have a song
Our song is the slamming screen door

When were on the phone and you talk real slow
cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date Man I didnt kiss her when I should have

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
Hes got a onehand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around turn the radio down
He says baby is something wrong
I say nothing I was just thinking how we dont have a song
Our song is the slamming screen doors
Sneakin out late tapping on your window
When were on the phone and you talk real low
cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date man I didnt kiss her and I should have
And when I got home before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway well on my way to my lovin bed
I almost didnt notice all the roses
And the note that said
Ive heard every album listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song
I was riding shotgun with the hair undone
in the front seat of his car
Hes got a one hand feel on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
I look around turned the radio down
he says baby is something wrong
I was just thinking how we dont have a song
Our song is a slaming screen door
when youre on the phone
and you talk real slow
cause its late and youre mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
man I didnt kiss her and I should have
And when I got home
I was walking up the front porch steps
and lost and thrown away
I got to the hallway
and the note that said
Ive heard every album
Ive ben waiting for something to come along
that was as good as our song
Cause our song is a slaming screen door
when were on the phone
and he talks real slow
and his mama dont know
Our song is the way he laughs

and when I got home

Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here wed laugh about their vacant stares
But right now my time is theirs
Seems like theres always someone who disapproves
Theyll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jurys out my choice is you
So dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high the waters rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I dont care cuz right now youre mine
And youll say “So dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high the waters rough
But this love is ours”
And its not theirs to speculate if its wrong
And your hands are tough but they are where mine belong in
Ill fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
Cuz I love the gap between your teeth
I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored cuz my heart is yours
So dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they cant take whats ours
They cant take whats ours
The stakes are high the waters rough

It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
You took a Polaroid of us
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we out of the woods
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together back together
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldnt quite forget
When we decided we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying flying flying
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying baby I did too
But when the sun came up I was looking at you
Remember when we couldnt take the heat
I walked out and said Im setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
And when the sun came up you were looking at me
You were looking at me
You were looking at me
I remember oh I remember
I didnt know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason I know
I didnt read between the lines
And baby Ive got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you this aint the best view
On the outside looking in
Ive been a lot of lonely places
Ive never been on the outside
You saw me there but never knew
I would give it all up to be
A part of this a part of you
And now its all too late so you see
You couldve helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until its too
So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you this aint the best view
On the outside looking in
Ive been a lot of lonely places
Ive never been on the outside
So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you this aint the best view
On the outside looking in
Ive been a lot of lonely places
Ive never been on the outside
State the obvious I didnt get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that Im obsessive and crazy
Album version line Thats fine Ill tell mine that youre gay
Music video version line Thats fine you wont mind if I say

You never let me drive
Whos really bad at lying

From going out with all of your best friends

I dont know what I want so dont ask me
Cause Im still trying to figure it out
Dont know whats down this road Im just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though Im not the only one
Who feels the way I do
Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on my old blue jeans
And Im wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrows just a mystery oh yeah
Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Maybe Im just a girl on a mission
But Im ready to fly
Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on
Oh Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Oh Im just a girl
Oh Im just a girl oh oh

driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
trying to change your mind
once youre already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
so bright just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like Ive never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
trying to know somebody youve never met
But loving him was red
realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
and realizing theres no right answer
Regretting him was like
wishing youd never found out that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like Ive never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
trying to know somebody youve never met
But loving him was red
Tell myself its time now gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
when I still see it all in my head
Oh losing him was blue like Ive never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
trying to know somebody youve never met
Cause loving him was red
And thats why hes spinning round in my head
Comes back to me burning red
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead end streetLyrics submitted by M P
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Passionate as sin ended so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you’re already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like I’d never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody youve never met
But loving him was red
Touching him is like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there’s no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like I’d never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody youve never met
But loving him was red
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it’s time now gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
Oh losing him was blue like I’d never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody youve never met

I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor
Plastic dinosaurs I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand
Little man from even that moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
Come on baby with me
Were gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years
I remember the drive home when the blind hope
Turned to crying and screaming Why
Flowers piled up in the worst way
No one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died
And its about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear
Come on baby with me
Were gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room in this hospital gray
Come on baby with me
Were gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years
What if Im standing in your closet trying to talk to you
What if I kept the hand me downs you wont grow into
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through
But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you
Come on baby with me
Were gonna fly away from here
Come on baby with me
Were gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years
I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the moon and backLyrics submitted by hhhaley
Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words how little they mean when youre a little too late
I stood right by the tracks your face in a locket
Good girls hopeful theyll be and lonely will wait
We had a beautiful magic love affair
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
In dreams I meet you in long conversation
We both wake in lonely beds and different cities
And time is ticking a sweet summer race in you
And youve got your demons and darling they all look like me
Cause we had a beautiful magic love affair
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
Distance timing break down fighting
Silence this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me try to fix it could you just try to listen
Hang up give up for the life of us we cant get back
A beautiful magic love affair
What a sad beautiful tragic beautiful tragic beautiful
What we had a beautiful magic love affair
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
We had a beautiful magic love affair
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said Ill never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said Dont leave me here alone
But all thats dead and gone and passed tonight
The sun is going down
No one can hurt you now
You and Ill be safe and sound
Dont you dare look out your window darling
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the musics gone
The sun is going down
No one can hurt you now
You and Ill be safe and sound
You and Ill be safe and sound
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oh oh x7
Ill wait up for you
Think of all the boys
Next year I could be

Got nothing in my brain

But I cant make them stay
At least thats what people say mmmmmm

But I keep cruising
Cant stop wont stop moving
Its like I got this music
In my mind
Saying Its gonna be alright
Cause the players gonna play play play play play
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate
Baby Im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
I shake it off I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break break break break break break
And the fakers gonna fake fake fake fake fake fake
Baby Im just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
I shake it off I shake it off
I never miss a beat
Im lightning on my feet
And thats what they dont see mmmmmm
Thats what they dont see mmmmmm
Im dancing on my own dancing on my own
I make the moves up as I go moves up as I go
And thats what they dont know mmmmmm
Thats what they dont know mmmmmm

Its strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles the flowers everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong
And you say that youd take it all back given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes
You shouldve said no you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice before you let it all go
You shouldve know that word bout what you did with her
Would get back to me
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no baby and you might still have me
You can see that Ive been crying
baby you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same
You say that the past is the past give me one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes
I cant resist before you go tell me this

The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And Im a house of cards
Youre the kind of reckless
That should send me runnin
But I kinda know that I wont get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldnt see
What I was thinking of
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
My mind forgets to remind me
You touch me once and its really something
You find Im even better than you imagined I would be
Im on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know its no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me its just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Wont you whisper soft and slow
Im captivated by you baby like a firework show
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you though it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
Dont say yes run away now
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said speak now
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride to be
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me you wish it was me dont you
I hear the preacher say speak now or forever hold your peace
Theres a silence theres my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But Im only looking at you
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
And youll say lets run away now
Ill meet you when Im out of my tux at the back door
Baby I didnt say my vows so glad you were around when they said Speak NowLyrics submitted by deric
I said oh my what marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight
Like were made of starlight
I met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of 45
Picked me up late one night at the window
He was 17 and crazy running wild wild
Cant remember what song he was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
I said oh my what marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight
Like were made of starlight
He said look at you worrying so much about things you cant change
Youll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking away
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
Dont you see the starlight starlight
Dont you dream impossible things
Like oh my what marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight
Like were made of starlight
Ooh ooh hes talking in crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream
I said oh my what marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight
Like were made of starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Dont you see the starlight
Dont you dream impossible things
Im walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know is don’t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And I love the Sade’s are wrong
We learn to live with the pain
But this love is raging and wild
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same again
This is a state of grace
This is a worth while fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
This is the golden age of something good
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
This is a state of grace
This is a worth while fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and rightLyrics submitted by isabella lim
Im walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know is dont let go
We are in love just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs four blue eyes
So you were never a saint and I love that the shades are wrong
We learn to live with the pain mostly our broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of faith
This is the golden age of something good and right and real
And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same
And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and rightLyrics submitted by Tiah
Corys eyes are like a jungle
He smiles its like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
These pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as hes walking home
Youre really gonna be someone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your love will lead you back to my door
Oh but if it dont
Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
Im taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
Its hard to make a conversation
When hes taking my breath away
I should say hey by the way
Youre really gonna be someone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your love will lead you back to my door
Oh but if it dont
If you and I are a story
If what you are is a daydream
Ill never get to hold
Youre really gonna be someone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your love lead you back to my front door
Oh but if it dont
Oh but if it dont
Na na na na na

Im pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turnaway
This morning I said we should talk about it
Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
Thats when you came in wearing a football helmet and said okay lets talk
Ive been lovin you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay
Before you Id only dated selfindulgent takers
that took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now Im always laughin
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to
Ive been lovin you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay stay stay stay
You took the time to memorize me
my fears my hopes and dreams
I just like hangin out with you all the time
All those times that you didnt leave
Its been occurring to me Id like to hang out with you for my whole life
And Ill be loving you for quite some time
No one else is going to love me when I get mad mad mad
So I think that its best if we both stay stay stay stay stay stay
Ive been lovin you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay stay stay stay stay stay
Ive been lovin you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay
You come and pick me up no headlights
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Oh it’s been a while since I have even heard from you
I should just tell you to leave cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch it go round and round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And then we go crashing down we come back every time
We never go out of style we never go out of style
You’ve got that long hair slick back white tshirt
And I got that good girl fate and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style we never go out of style
He can’t keep his wild eyes on the road
Lights are off he’s taking off his coat
I say “I’ve heard that you’ve been out
And about with some other girl some other girl”
He says “what you’ve heard is true but I
Can’t stop thinking about you and I”
I said “I’ve been there too a few times”
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And then we go crashing down we come back every time
We never go out of style we never go out of style
You’ve got that long hair slick back white tshirt
And I got that good girl fate and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style we never go out of style
Yeah just take me home
Oh you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
We never go out of style we never go out of style
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
Its the same thing to me
Hes got his mothers eyes his fathers ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
And I know every word that you say yay
You smile and say how are you
I always forget to tell you I love you I love you forever
I watched superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today
To save the world ill be around
I watched superman fly away
Come back ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down
Hes complicated hes so irrational
But I hope someday you take me away and save the day yeeeeahhh
Something in his deep browns eyes has me sayin Hes not all bad like his reputation
I cant hear one single word they say
You really got places to be and Ill be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you I loved you from the very first day
I watched superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today
To save the world ill be around
I watched superman fly away
Come back ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down
And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you dont save some other girl
dont forget dont forget about me
Im far away but ill never let you go
Im lovestruck and looking out the window
Dont forget dont forget where ill be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
Cuz I loved you from the very first day
I watched superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today to save the world
Ill be around forever and ever
I watched superman fly away
I swear ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down

This is wrong but I cant help but feel like
There aint nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I cant
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
Id be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name
So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another
Wide eyed girl whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar
Morning loneliness comes around when Im not
When my world wakes up today
Youll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face Id be
Counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name
So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another
Wide eyed girl whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar
You played in bars you play guitar
Im invisible and everyone knows who you are
And youll never see you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio
So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another
Wide eyed girl whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar

Hit the ground hit the ground hit the ground oh oh
Only sound only sound that you hear is “no”
You never saw it coming
Except when you started runnning
And now you come undone I I I
Seen you fall seen you crawl on you knees eh eh
Seen you lost in a crowd seen you colors fade
Wish I could make it better
This pain you thought would last forever and ever
There you stand ten feet tall
I will say “I knew it all along”
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
Just a shot just a shot in the dark oh oh
All you got all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you’re on to something
What a sight what a sight when the light came on
Put me right threw me right when you put them front
And in this perfect weather
It’s like we don’t remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever
There you stand ten feet tall
I will say “I knew it all along”
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand next to me
All at once the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction fiction
I’ll be one of the many saying
Look at you now look at you now now
I’ll be one of the many saying
You’ve made us proud you’ve made us proud
I’ll be one of the many saying
Look at you now look at you now now
I’ll be one of the many saying
You’ve made us proud you’ve made us proud proud
And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I’ll be there time and again
‘Cause I you loved when
When you hit the ground hit the ground hit the ground oh oh
Only sound only sound that you hear is “no”
Now in this perfect weather
It’s like we don’t remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever
There you stand ten feet tall
I will say “I knew it all along”
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand next to me
All at once the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction fiction
Say you’re sorry that face of an angel comes out
Just when you need it to
As I pace back and forth all this time
‘Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on the days drag on
Stupid girl I should have known I should have known
That I’m not a princess
This ain’t a fairytale
I’m not the one you’ll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain’t Hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your White Horse
Baby I was naive got lost in your eyes
I never really had a chance
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings now I know
I’m not a princess
This ain’t a fairytale
I’m not the one you’ll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain’t Hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your White Horse
And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I’m so sorry
Cause I’m not your princess
This ain’t a fairytale
I’m gonna find someone some day
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it’s too late for you and your White Horse
Now its too late for you and your White Horse
To catch me now
Oh whoa whoa whoa oh
Try and catch me now Ohh
It’s too late to catch me nowLyrics submitted by emily

I took a chance I took a shot
And you might think Im bulletproof but im not
You took a swing I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are
Im sick and tired of your attitude
Im feeling like I dont know you
You tell me that you love me then you cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when youre around
And heres to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
You could write a book on how to ruin someones perfect day
Well I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what Im trying to say oh
Im sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when youre around
Heres to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Whydo you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Whydo you have to put down my dreams
So youre the only thing on my mind
Im sick and tired of your attitude
Im feeling like I dont know you
You tell me that you want me then cut me down
Im sick and tired of your reasons
Ive got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love then you push me around
Heres to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
I take a step back let you go
I told you Im not bulletproof
Ive got my big coat on
And look up smiling at you
Look now the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep
I dont know why all the trees change in the fall
I know youre not scared of anything at all
Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day
And dont know how my friends
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive
Until weve found a town
And we talk and windowshop
Until Ive forgotten all their names
I dont know who Im gonna talk to
I know Im laughing on the car ride home with you
Dont know how long its gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day
I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Hes better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And youre talking to me
Its the age of princesses and pirate ships
And youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine
And I didnt know if you knew
So Im taking this chance to say
That I had the best day
Found myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better
Right before your eyes
I’m breaking no past
Just you and me
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
When right before your eyes
I’m aching run fast
Just you and me…
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye…
This is the last time you tell me I’ve got it wrong
This is the last time I say it’s been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time I won’t hurt you anymore
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
This is the last time I’m asking you this this is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name on the top of your list name on the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why this is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye You break my heart…
This is the last time I’m asking you this
Time I’m asking you this
Time I’m asking you this
Time I’m asking you this
New to town with a made up name in the angel city
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties’ queen
Another name goes up in lights like diamonds in the sky
And they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
Yeah they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now you’re the lucky one oh oh oh
Now it’s big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you’re lucky
Cause you don’t feel pretty you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place
Another name goes up in lights You wonder if you’ll make it out alive
And they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
Yeah they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
Can you tell me now you’re the lucky one oh oh oh
It was a few years later I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square
And it took some time but I understand it now
‘Cause now my name is up in lights but I think you got it right
Let me tell you now you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now you’re the lucky one oh oh oh
Yeah they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
Yeah they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
And they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
I said this time ive had enough
and youve called a hundred times but im not picking up
cause Im so mad I might tell you that its over
but if you look a little closer
I said leave but all I really want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming Im in love with you
wait there in the pouring rain
and dont you leave cause I know all I need is on the other side of the door
Me and my stupied pride
goin through the photographs
I keep going back over
and I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread
so baby if you know everything
tell me why you couldnt see
that when I left I wanted you to
I said leave but all I really want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming Im in love with you
wait there in the pouring rain
and dont you leave cause I know all i need is on the other side of the door
and I scream out the window I cant even look at you
I dont need you but I do I do I do
I say theres nothing you can say
to make this right again and I mean it I mean it
I said leave but baby all I want is you
to stand outside my window throwing pebbles
screaming Im in love with you
wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
and dont you leave cause I now all I need is on the other side of the door
with your face and beautiful eyes
and the conversation with the little white lies
and the faded picture of a beautiful night
you carry me from you car up the stairs
and I broke down crying was she worth this mess
after everything in that little black dress
after everything i must confess
I need youLyrics submitted by Nathalie
I didnt know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason I know
I didnt read between the lines
And baby Ive got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you this aint the best view
On the outside looking in
Ive been a lot of lonely places
Ive never been on the outside
You saw me there but never knew
I would give it all up to be
A part of this a part of you
And now its all too late so you see
You couldve helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until its too
So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you this aint the best view
On the outside looking in
Ive been a lot of lonely places
Ive never been on the outside
I used to think one day wed tell the story of us
And the sparks flew instantly
The people would say theyre the lucky ones
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now Im searching the room for an empty seat
Cause lately I dont even know what page youre on
Oh a simple complication Miscommunications lead to fall out
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I cant break through
Now Im standing alone in a crowded room
And Im dying to know
Is it killing you
Like its killing me yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Howd we end up this way
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And youre doing your best to avoid me
Im starting to think one day Ill tell the story of us
how I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like I should have held me
Oh Im scared to see the ending why are we pretending this is nothing
Id tell you I miss you but I dont know how
Ive never heard silence quite this loud
Now Im standing alone in a crowded room
And Im dying to know
Is it killing you
Like its killing me yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battles in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you said youd rather love then fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
Now Im standing alone in a crowded room
And Im dying to know
Is it killing you
Like its killing me yeah
And I dont know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
And Im dying to know is it killing you like its killing me
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate cause were going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and its like
I couldnt ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And its 2am and Im cursing your name
Youre so in love that you act insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breakin down and coming undone
Its a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
Hes close to my mother
Talks business with my father
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And its 2am and Im cursing your name
Youre so in love that you act insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breakin down and coming undone
Its a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you
He cant see the smile Im faking
And my hearts not breaking
Cause Im not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Complicated got away by some mistake and now
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
Its 2am and Im cursing your name
Im so in love that I acted insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
Its a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you oh oh
And thats the way I loved you oh oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved youLyrics submitted by Leandra
High tides came and brought you in
And I could go on and on on and on and I will
Skies grow darker currents switch you out again
And you are just gone and gone gone and gone
In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this
This love is good this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me
Struggle through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on on and on
Lantern burning flickered in my mind for only you
But you were still gone gone gone
Been losing grip sinking ships
You showed up just in time
This love is good this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me
This love this love this love oh…
Your kiss my cheek unwashed you leave
Your smile my ghost I fell to my knees
When you’re young you just run
But you come back to what you need
This love is good this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
And this love came back to me
This love this love this love oh…

Hello UghLyrics submitted by Ronae
Seems the only one who doesnt see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking youre not pretty
But thats not true cause I know you
Hold on baby youre losing it
The waters high youre jumping into it
And letting go and no one knows
That you cry but you dont tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone
I guess its true that love was all you wanted
Cause youre giving it away like its extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh cause its not his price to pay
Not his price to pay
Hold on baby youre losing it
The waters high youre jumping into it
And letting go and no one knows
That you cry but you dont tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone
Hold on baby youre losing it
The waters high youre jumping into it
And letting go and no one knows
That you cry but you dont tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone
Youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone oh
With a smile baby baby
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said Thats a lie
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin stuck
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
September saw a month of tears
And thankin God that you werent here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
Its hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin back on all of that its nice to believe
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
I hope you think that little black dress

And Im back for the first time since then
Im standin on your street
And theres a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that youll read is
