Nas Pay homage respect
Uhnnh I dont know what you cats was thinking
Nas Pay homage respect
To step up on stage at CMJ mention my name
I hear these cats but I aint listening
A little faint dissing a little scratch a little paint missin
But I still gleam and glisten hot like a stream of piss n
Im about to have ya whole team wishing
That you never got this shit started
You about to be dearly departed you gotta be nearly retarded
To let me hear my name mention tryna gain attention
Now Im runnin through this game lynchin
And I heard a few cats tryna take shots on the low
These XFL rappers tryna fuck with a real pro
One thing who named yall the High and the Mighty
To me yall just sound like a couple of High Whities
You had to be on mad coke and XTC
To think for a second you can stand next to me
Look dont ever again mention my name in ya freestyles
Or I cut off ya transmission faster than Lee Miles
And I heard ya album this must be something youre new at
Cause I rather hear a Lil WayneLil Zane duet
My cellphone stay ringin like a slap in the ear
So I hope yall dont plan on making rap a career
Cause ever since Heav was in Vernon I been burnin
Next year yall be up in Rawkus interning
And I shoulda let it known what your government names are
To make sure you Take It Personal like Gang Starr motherfuckers
Guru I got one lyric pointed at your head for start
Another one is pointed at your weak ass heart
And that go for any other so called rapcats in the game
Guru Another fake jack I slay with my spectac rap display
And believe me I aint forget about him naw
Nope Nas Acknowledge the rep
Yo yeah I heard of the Boogiemann when I was a youth scary
And I found out that he was as fake as a toothfairy
Since my last mission this niggas been asskissing
I took a minute I gave your single a fast listen
Tell me this no pot to piss in How you dissin
You group holmes are about to report that you missing
And I dont know who was worse the track or the verse
Ima get to your producer but Im smacking you first
See I couldnt even find one nigga that heard of you
I did find a few cats that wanted to murder you
But I told em Chill I let em know you was my son
And I promise I can pay support to you twentyone
Consider me the clothes on your back and a warm meal
Who knows this might just get you a deal
And the day that your album go on sale for the first hour
Just remember like Nas nigga I Gave You Power
I figured I give ya some help cause you need lots
I make your producer change his name to Speed Nottz
Tell him I say Fuck him for doing the tracks
Matter of fact fuck Fat Beats for doing the wax
Ima diss you via email and then through a fax
Ima diss you by twoway I aint gon never relax
Ima diss you over fast slow track or no track
If your shit wasnt so wack I dissed you to yo track
You that little fish that I catch and I throw back
And by the way give 50 Cent his flow back
You that cat in the club that get hit with a bottle
Fuckin with me You better off trying to hit lotto
And dont answer back this is hard shit to follow
And you cant spit nigga so you obviously must swollow motherfuckerLyrics submitted by jeffrey
