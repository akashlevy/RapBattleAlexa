Catch ‘em by surprise x3
Bounce to the beat people hands up
Everybody in the place stand up
And jump it shake it bust the club
And there’s nothing you can do to hold ‘em off
And when the beautiful women be showing off
We’re ’bout to cause a riot in this house
Till we hear the fire alarms going off
Do we really got them all in a trance
Do we really got them all in a trance
Everytime time I come in
And I stumble on the feeling
And we lit the fires
So I hope you know we got our run on
Cause you gotta know that when we get
Ain’t gotta question if you gotta C’mon
And hurt ‘em up Give it to ‘em

Spark another match and let it flame

We made it even though we had our backs
See a nigga survived the worst
But my life is glorious uh
But I know that I leaped every hurdle
And Im so victorious uh
Take a look Im a symbol of greatness
Now call a nigga Morpheus yeah
As force securin the win but they
Believe Im so notorious yeah
You know that Ive been bout my bread
Even though we rappin now yes
We used to live on the strip even though
A nigga higher level trappin now oh
Superseded everyone of my little struggles and uh
So failure has never ever been an option trust
A nigga paper long like rush hour traffic
And Im about to take the hood shoppin get it
Together we made it sing we did it niggas
We made it even though we had our backs
Up against the wall come on
Forever we waited ah hah
And they told us we were never gonna
Get it all we took it on the road
To the riches on the road
To the ghetto on the road
In the projects to this bangin instrumental on the road
Ride with me on the road
Come and get it on the road
When it all got started we were steadily
And it seemed like nothin we could do
Could ever get us respected
At best we were stressed at the worst
They probably said were pathetic
Had all the pieces to that puzzle
Just the way to connect it
I was fighting through every rhyme
Never restin the question if I
Was out of my mind
It finally came time to do it or let it die
So we put the chips on the table and
Told them to let it ride sing it yeah
Together we made it sing we did it niggas
We made it even though we had our backs
Up against the wall come on
Forever we waited ah hah
And they told us we were never gonna
Get it all we took it on the road
To the riches on the road
To the ghetto on the road
In the projects to this bangin instrumental on the road
Ride with me on the road
Come and get it on the road
In case you misunderstand exactly what Im buildin
And shit that I could leave for
My children children children children
Now on the wake up I smile to see how far Ive come yeah
Fighting for sales when Im stripped
To negate the hustle from yeah
From nights in jail on a bench using my muscles son yeah
To countin money like Dre and Jimmy and Russel was yeah nigga
But now I live when I dream you see we finally did it oh
Lets make a toast to the hustle
Regardless how you get it sing it
