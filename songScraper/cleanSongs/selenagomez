When I think about you
With every breath I take
No matter what I do
My world is an empty place
Like Ive been wonderin the desert
Dont know if its a mirage
But I always see your face baby
Im missing you so much
Cant help it Im in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Dont know how Ill survive
A day without you is like a year without rain
I hear your voice in my mind
Cant you hear me calling
Like the ocean thats running dry
Its like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet
Theres gonna be a monsoon
When you get back to me baby
Im missing you so much
Cant help it Im in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Dont know how Ill survive
A day without you is like a year without rain
So let this drought come to an end
And may this desert flower again
And I need you here
But a day without you
Is like a year without rain
Im missing you so much
Cant help it Im in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Dont know how Ill survive
A day without you is like a year without rainLyrics submitted by jj

Di que sientes cuando pienso en ti una y otra vez
Cada instante que no estás junto a mí
Mi mundo está al revés
Camino en un desierto cuando tú te vas
No sé si es un espejismo te siento tan real baby
Quiero volverte a ver para calmar mi sed
Un día sin ti es como un año sin ver llover
Si esto pasa otra vez no sobreviviré
Un día sin ti es como un año sin ver llover
Contando estrellas oigo en mi mente tu voz
Mi corazón esta sufriendo la soledad
Camino en hojas secas si no estás aquí y mi vida
Regresa que un diluvio lloraré por ti
Quiero volverte a ver para calmar mi sed
Un día sin ti es como un año sin ver llover
Si esto pasa otra vez no sobreviviré
Un día sin ti es como un año sin ver llover
Soy un desierto sin tu querer
Vuelve pronto a mí no seas así porque
Un día sin ti es como un año sin ver llover
Quiero volverte a ver para calmar mi sed
Un día sin ti es como un año sin ver llover
Si esto pasa otra vez no sobreviviré
Un día sin ti es como un año sin ver llover Lyrics submitted by selena

Im going in Im ready to surrender
Like a diamond I need a little pressure
So press me down till I scream
If youre the flame Im kerosene
All I need all I need is your body heat
All I need all I need is your body heat
Oh my God it feels amazing when you hold me close
Know me like the summer baby dont let go
All I want is your body
Burn it up burn it up
So give it up give it up
All I need all I need is your body heat
Im restless Im craving your attention
My red lips have found a new obsession
Lets go all night just you and me
If youre the flame Im kerosene

All I need all I need is your body heat
Oh my God it feels amazing when you hold me close

And all of the stars above
You melt me and my body feels no shame
And I dont care tonight
If it burns too bright
Cause baby thats why I came
All I need all I need is your body heat
All I need all I need is your body heat

You threw in the towel I broke your heart
But theres a first time for everything
Who wouldve thought youd feel so cold
And all these memories seem so old
To think you were my everything
Remember when wed talk all night
But time aint easy on us how can love die
I got so much shit to say
But I cant help feeling like Im camouflage
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
But its good to see you here again
I dont wanna say goodbye
But its about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride
Riding alone on the 405
And lifes so fragile its like I could cry
If thats the last time Id see you again
But Ill never tell you just how I felt
You might just not care and it might just not help
What if the feelings just dont make no sense to you you
Remember when wed talk all night
But time aint easy on us how can love die
I got so much shit to say
But I cant help feeling like Im camouflage
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
But its good to see you here again
I dont wanna say goodbye
But its about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride
I got so much shit to say
But I cant help feeling like Im camouflage
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
But its good to see you here again
I dont wanna say goodbye
But its about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

I guess I shouldve known
It wasnt gonna end okay
Youre such a trouble maker
But I like you just that way
A bomb tick ticking with
Neither one of to blame
Just like a count down
Ready to blow
I sat around a lot and thought
About the world without you
And no matter what you think
Everything is not about you
You think Im still hung up on you
But baby its not true
Now look at me
Your memories turn to dust
Theres only one explanation
I wasnt really in love
I wasnt really in love
It was just a crush
It was just a crush
Sparks fly when we touch
It was never enough
It was just a crush
It was just a crush
You found one the things you need
Theres nothing left to lose
The things I never wanna be
I owe it all to you
You just cant help yourself
Its what you do
Cause this is real life
Now look at me
The memories turn to dust
Theres only one explanation
I wasnt really in love
I wasnt really in love
It was just a crush
It was just a crush
Sparks fly when we touch
It was never enough
It was just a crush
It was just a crush
Just find another girl
Until they all know what
Now look at me
The memories turn to dust
Theres only one explanation
I wasnt really in love
I wasnt really in love
It was just a crush
It just was a crush
Sparks fly when we touched
It was never enough
It was just a crush
It was just a crush It was just a crush
It was just a crush

Yo no quiero ser otra persona
Me dijo que no era lo suficientemente bueno
Pero ¿quién eres tú para juzgar
Cuando eres un diamante en bruto
Estoy seguro de que tiene algunas cosas
Que le gustaría cambiar de ti mismo
Pero cuando se trata de mí
Yo no quiero ser otra persona
Yo no soy reina de belleza
¿Quién dice que no eres perfecto
¿Quién dice que no vales la pena
¿Quién dice que es el único que está perjudicando
Ese es el precio de la belleza
¿Quién dice que no está muy
¿Quién dice que no eres hermosa
Selena Gomez Verse 2
¿Cómo no hay nada divertido cuando eres tú
Te digo lo que quieres decir
Pero siguen bacaladilla la verdad
Es como una obra de arte
Que nunca llega a ver la luz
No le permite tocar el cielo

Nada que temer nada que cambiar
Por ti me olvidé de quién yo era en realidad
Contigo me quedé como un diamante sin brillar
No quiero ser así espejo de tu vanidad
sin nada que temer nada que cambiar
Una flor de metal no no
que tu eres mi dueño
Quien no te madura todo el tiempo
Dices que hablo cosas tontas
Quien te crees que eres dime quién
Que no me quieras controlar
Permíteme vivir soñando ésta realidad
No ves que soy así distinta sin igual
Una flor de metal no no
que tu eres mi dueño
Quien no te madura todo el tiempo
Dices que hablo cosas tontas
Quien te crees que eres dime quién
Dices que soy una niña
Soy lo que me gusta ser
Mírame bien no estoy hecha de papel
que tu eres mi dueño

Sitting on my bed with just a tshirt on
Turning up the volume to my favorite song
What we did last night
You know its constantly replaying staying on my mind
Ill show you want I like boy boy boy
If you show me what you like boy boy boy
Ill show you what I like
Show you what I like like
If you show me what you like boy
If I had my way
Boy you know wed do it every single day
If I had a wish
And If I had my way
Boy you know wed do it every single day
Wish I didnt feel so hypnotized
But When I look at you baby its justified
So I take what I want
And give what I got
To help with all the rules that keep us civilized
Ill show you want I like boy boy boy
If you show me what you like boy boy boy
Ill show you what I like
Show you what I like like
If you show me what you like boy
If I had my way
Boy you know wed do it every single day
If I had a wish
And If I had my way
Boy you know wed do it every single day
No where Id rather be
Than anywhere alone just you and me
Ill be too gentle youll be my Clyde
Well be together forever well ride
I want you more and more
You gotta take that and the day before
No lie no lie no lie no lie
If I had my way
Boy you know wed do it every single day
If I had a wish
And If I had my way
Boy you know wed do it every single day
Ill show you want I like boy boy boy
If you show me what you like boy boy boy
Ill show you what I like
Show you what I like like
If you show me what you like boy
Well you know everything gonna be a breeze
At the end will no doubt justify the means
You can fix any problem with the slightest ease
But you might find out itll go to your head
When you write a report on a book youve never read
And with the snap of your fingers you can make your bed
Everything is not what it seems
When you can get what you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems
Everything is not what it seems
When you can have all you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is notwhat it seems Lyrics submitted by alafe
Like youre some new sensation
You dont need an invitation
You cant get no satisfaction
So you can get the right reaction
It wont be long my darling
Where are your friends now baby
Supposed to be there for
You and youre falling down
The world starts spinning out
You and youre falling down
No its not all about
You and youre falling down
You know Ill be around
When you look into the mirror
But the lies are getting clearer
Your smile is so elastic
But theyre all just made of plastic
It wont be long my darling
Where are your friends now baby
Supposed to be there for
You and youre falling down
The world starts spinning out
You and youre falling down
No its not all about
You and youre falling down
You know Ill be around
If theyre all about to trash you
You and youre falling down
The world starts spinning out
You and youre falling down
No its not all about
You when youre falling down
You know Ill be around
If theyre all about to trash youLyrics submitted by Y
Fly to who you are
You believe youll find your wings
A sprinkle of pixie dust circles the night
Fly to who you are
You believe youll find your wings
Your soul will find a home
Youll be free to spread your wings
Rise to the heights of all you can be
Soar on the hope of marvelous things
Fly to who you are
You believe youll find your wings
Your soul will find a home
Youll be free to spread your wings

I told I told I told myself again
Im never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but youre so
Far away so far away
Wont listen to the conscience in my head
Im conscious but Im lonely halfway dead
Tired of the things you never
You never said you never said
Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world
Knew my name my name my name my name
I know I know I know we cant pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would
Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world
Knew my name my name my name my name
I told I told I told myself again
Im never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but youre so
Far away so far away
Wont listen to the conscience in my head
Im conscious but Im lonely halfway dead
Tired of the things you never
You never said you never said
Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world
Knew my name my name my name my name
I know I know I know we cant pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would
Go away just go away
Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world
Knew my name my name my name my name
Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world
Knew my name my name my name my name
Turn my back to the door
Feel so much better now
Don’t even try anymore
As the voice that’s in the air
Sayin’ don’t look back no where
Theres a voice that’s always there
And I’ll never be quite the same as I was before
This part of you still remains oh it’s out of focus
Your just somewhere that I’ve been
And I won’t go back again
Your just somewhere that I’ve been
I’m breathin’ in breathin’ out
Ain’t that what its all about
Like I have the right to
No more words in my mouth
Nothin’ left to figure out
That I don’t think I’ll ever break through
The ghost of you
And I’ll never be like I was the day I met you
To naive Yes I was
Boy that’s why I let you in
Wear your memory like a stain
Can’t erase none of the pain
Here to stay with me forever
Breathin’ in breathin’ out
Ain’t that what it’s all about
Like I have the right to
No more words in my mouth
Nothin’ left to figure out
That I don’t think I’ll ever break through
One of these days
I’ll wake up from this bad dream I’m dreamin’
One of these days I pray that I’ll be overoverover you
One of these days I’ll realize that I’m to tired of
But for now there’s a reason
That you’re still here in my heart
Breathin’ in breathin’ out
Ain’t that what it’s all about
Like I have the right to
Know the words in my mouth
Nothin’ left for me to doubt
That I don’t think I’ll ever break through
Breathin’ in breathin’ out
Breathin’ in breathin’ out
Like I have the right to
No more words in my mouth
Nothin’ left to figure out
But I don’t think I’ll ever break through
The the ghost of you
Im on my 14 carats
Doing it up like Midas
Now you say I got a touch
Make you never wanna leave
Gonna wear that dress you like skintight
Do my hair up real real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating
Cause I just wanna look good for you good for you
I just wanna look good for you good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you good for you
Im on my marquise diamonds
Could even make that Tiffany jealous
You say I give it to you hard
Make you never wanna leave
Gonna wear that dress you like skintight
Do my hair up real real nice
And syncopate my skin to how youre breathing
Cause I just wanna look good for you good for you
I just wanna look good for you good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you good for you
Trust me I can take you there
Trust me I can take you there
Trust me I trust me I trust me I
Hold on take a minute love
Cause I aint trying to mess your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble round town pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I dont give a
I aint trying to mess your fitness up
And I aint trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin on me in the club
Any time I hit it know she feelin for it through
And any time we get up always end up on the news
Aint worried bout no press and aint worried bout the next chick
They love the way you dress and aint got shit up on you
Just met a bad miss without the ass shots
You look good girl you know you did good dont you
You look good girl bet it feel good dont it
Cause I just wanna look good for you good for you
Baby let me be good to you good to you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you good for you
Trust me I trust me I trust me I
Cant keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard Im trying to
I want you all to myself
Your metaphorical gin and juice
So come on give me a taste
Of what its like to be next to you
Wont let one drop go to waste
Your metaphorical gin and juice
Ohh cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And Im trying Im trying Im trying Im trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And Im trying Im trying Im trying but I
Cant keep my hands to myself
Cant keep my hands to myself
The doctor say youre no good
But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
Id breathe you in every single day
Ohh cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And Im trying Im trying Im trying Im trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other

Its the boy you never told I like you
Its the girl you let get away
Its the one you saw that day on the train
but you freaked out and walked away
Its the plane you wanna catch to Vegas
things you swear youll do before you die
Its the city of love that waits for you
but your too damn scared to fly
let the music move you
let the moment take you
Its the time that you totally screwed up
still youre trying to get it out your brain
Its the fight you had when you didnt make up
Its the past youre dying to change
Its all the money that youre saving
while the good life passes by
Its all the dreams that never came true
cause your too damn scared to try
Its a mad mad world
when you go all the way
let the music move you
So lets go go go go
yeah lets go go go go
from the floor to the rafters
Its a mad mad world
when you go all the way
let the music move you

It doesnt hurt when i think of you
And all the things well never get to do
I dont dream at night about the way we were
I tore up the pictures and crossed out all the words
Dont be fooled right on my tears cause everything is fine
And you can pick up all the pieces that you left behind
Cause i never think about you Im better off with out you
I dont miss you at all I dont miss you at all
You dont spin around in my head Its like you never existed
And i hope you dont call I dont miss you at all
And im not trying to fight it no im not trying to fight it
So you can cross my name right off the wall
I dont miss you at all
I go out 7 nights a week It feels good to finally be free
And i party like a never did before what in the world what was I waiting for
Everything is perfect now without you in my life
You can pick up all the pieces that you left behind
Cause i never think about you Im better off without you
I dont miss you at all I dont miss you at all
You dont spin around in my head Its like you never existed
And I hope you dont call I dont miss you at all
And Im not trying to fight it no Im not trying to fight it
So you can cross my name right off the wall
I dont miss you at all
I dont miss you at all
I dont miss you at all
Ill just tell myself well forget the past
No time for regrets no more looking back
Ill forgive you more every single day
Every step i take is getting better
Cause i never think about you Im better off without you
I dont miss you at all I dont miss you at all you
Dont spin around in my head Its like you never existed
And I hope you dont call and I dont miss you at all
And Im not trying to fight it no Im not trying to fight it
So you can cross my name right off the wall
I dont miss you at all
I dont miss youLyrics submitted by Chelsea

The way that you do
They say that were just too young
But Im sure heart and soul
That I am never letting you go

Every single time that we kiss
You make the angels sing
You give that songbird wings
Cause no one else can make me feel
The way that you do
Ill never let you down
Ill always hear you out
There is nothing you cannot confide
You listen when I speak
You make my knees go weak
And I just want you by my side

If time could tune in today and we left too many things to say
If we could turn it back what would we want to change but now’s the time to take a chance
C’mon we got to make a stand
What if we gotta lose the choices in our hands
And we can find a way to do anything if we try to
Live like there’s no tomorrow cause all we have is here right now
Love like it’s all that we know The only chance that we ever found
Believe in what we feel inside Believe in it and it’ll never die
So never let this life pass us by
Live like there’s no tomorrow
It never was a night at day and then the week will fade away
Let it be nothing less and let the dreams remain
Take a leap and fade and hope you fly feel what it’s like to be alive
Give it all what we’ve got and lay it all on the line
And we can find a way to do anything if we try to
Live like there’s no tomorrow cause all we have is here right now
Love like it’s all that we know The only chance that we ever found
Believe in what we feel inside Believe in it and it’ll never die
So never let this life pass us by
Live like there’s no tomorrow
Will you be by my side We’ll do this together
Just you and Me Nothing is impossible Nothing is impossible
Live like there’s no tomorrow cause all we have is here right now
Love like it’s all that we know The only chance that we ever found
Believe in what we feel inside Believe in it and it’ll never die

Just wanted to let you know that you are my princess
You are worthy of all of the love in the world

The trips we dream of takin
The tags left on the map
When all you had was nothing
When all we did was laugh
Even if we try to forget
We used to be inseparable
I used to think that I was irreplaceable
We lit the whole world up
Before we blew it up

Cae la noche yo a tu lado
Viendo estrellas que al brillar
Que al mostrar nuestro querer
Tú y yo seremos la pareja ideal
Y juntos volaremos hasta el más haya
Tú y yo libres como el viento
Tú y yo hasta el firmamento
Arriésgate y vera que pronto pedirás
Tu y yo dos sobrevivientes
Tú y yo siempre indiferentes
Que importa el que dirán
Ven y dime al oído
Que no puedes ya vivir
Sin estar cerca de mí
Son más fuerte cada vez
Te adueñaste de mí ser
Tú y yo seremos la pareja ideal
Y juntos volaremos hasta el más haya
Tú y yo libres como el viento
Tú y yo hasta el firmamento
Tu y yo dos sobrevivientes
Tú y yo siempre indiferentes
Que importa el qué dirán
Vámonos de fiesta y bailemos hasta que amanezca
Sí la noche es corta no me importa pienso disfrutarla
Quiero Más Más y Más
Tú y yo libres como el viento
Tú y yo hasta el firmamento
Tú y yo dos sobrevivientes
Tú y yo siempre indiferentes
Que importa el qué dirán
Drop down on a desert ride
Never felt more more alive
I got my chicas by my side
If we want it we take it
If we need money we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know were making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
I dont need a man
Me and my girls me and my girls
Me and my me and my me and my me and my girls
Me and my girls me and my girls
The night is dark but the moon is bright
Were staring at this summer night
Tan skin looks damn good in white
Stripping down by the Hollywood sign
If we want it we take it
If we need money we make it

Ooh all the rhythm takes you over
Takes you to a different place
Ooh the smoke is getting closer
I can feel our young blood race
And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But dont you play a song about love
When I move my body
I dont have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do its stuff
Til the energy is too much
Is the rhythm me and the rhythm
Yeah the rhythm me and the rhythm
And I know I know I know
I wont I wont I wont
I know I know I know
If I said I didnt need
Yeah the rhythm me and the rhythm
Ooh I start to feel it now
Feeling like Im truly free
Ooh the heats a common ground
No matter whats your history
And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But dont you play a song about love
When I move my body
I dont have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do its stuff
Til the energy is too much
Is the rhythm me and the rhythm

You left me spinning like a disco
Trying but I dont know
If it can stand straight
You took me left when you knew I was right
And now I gotta fight just to make it through the day
I never knew what you were capable of
Baby I wouldve kept my heart
But I gave it up
Baby I fell in love
Now I dont know what its done
Its so cold with nobody to hold me
Youre so wrong leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this
Alone but now Im walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
You left me broken like a record
Baby Im hurt and I dont want to play anymore
And I was waiting for more
I never knew what you were capable of
Baby I wouldve kept my heart
But I gave it up
Baby I fell in love
Now I dont know what its done
Its so cold with nobody to hold me
Youre so wrong leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this
Alone but now Im walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
You took my heart off my sleeve
But now Im taking it back back
You took advantage of me
I dont appreciate that that
You son of a gun
Its so cold with nobody to hold me
Youre so wrong when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Its so cold with nobody to hold me
Youre so wrong leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this
Alone but now Im walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhereLyrics submitted by hannah
Friday night and were just talking
Stars are crashing in the sky
Burning just for you and I
We dont need to over think this
Nothing is going to bring us down
Show them what were all about
All the way one hundred one percent touch down
Were gonna kill it lead the pack
Lets go what you wanna wait for
Lets take everything we ask for
Come on and turn it up
Lets tell them what we want
Lets go take over the dance floor
You be mine and I will be yours
Come on and let it play
Let me hear you say
Take my hand and pull me closer
Whisper nothings in my ear
Till the walls just disappear
Feel my heart beat like a drum
Baby youre the only one
All the way one hundred one percent touch down
Were gonna kill it lead the pack
Lets go whatch ya wanna wait for
Lets take everything we ask for
Come on and turn it up
Lets tell them what we want
Lets go take over the dance floor
You be mine and I will be yours
Come on and let it play
Let me hear you say
Come on everybody lets go party
Till they kick us out now
Once we get it started we wont stop
Until we get it all out
Lets go whatch ya wanna wait for
Lets take everything we ask for
Come on and turn it up
Lets tell them what we want
Lets go take over the dance floor
You be mine and I will be yours
Come on and let it play
Let me hear you say

You come from here
You rock out in your room
I rock a world premier
were more alike than anybody could ever tell
Friday were cool Monday were freaks
sometimes we cant even speak
But we can get up let loose and lol
it may seem cliche for me to wanna say that your not alone
and you can call me uncool but its a simple fact
Cuz were one and the same
were anything but ordinary
were one and the same
I think were almost legendary
you and the perfect team chasing down the dream
La La La La La
Im kinda like you
We write the same song in a different key
Its got a rhythm you and me can get along
Selena and it may seem cliche for me to wanna say that your not alone
and you can call uncool but its a simple fact I still got your back
SelenaI Still got your back
Cuz were one and the same
I think were almost legendary
you and me the perfect team shaking up the scene
were one and the same
Were anything but ordinary
Were something more than momentary
you and me the perfect team
you and me the perfect team
Were one and the same

Youve been riding this horse a long time
Why cant you find what you where looking for
Always greener on the other side
Always believe there must be something more
Never stay very long anywhere
As the next girl you leave gets smaller
Youre in outlaw running from love
Youre in outlaw running from love
If you tear her world apart
If there´s a key to your heart
No one has found it yet
Youre in outlaw running from love
Your reputatons gettin out of control
I can believe she believes one word you say
Before I let you take my girlfriend home
Ive got to warn her about the price on your head
It must feel so alone out there
Always running away from someone
Youre in outlaw running from love
Youre in outlaw running from love
If you tear her world apart
If there´s a key to your heart
No one has found it yet
Youre in outlaw running from love
Im from the Lone Star State
Im ready to bring you in
Im gonna see your face make you pay for all of your sins
Youve been riding this horse a long time
I´ve had my eye on you all night
I´m gonna find a way to make you mind
Youre in outlaw running from love
Youre in outlaw running from love
If you tear her world apart
If there´s a key to your heart
No one has found it yet
Youre in outlaw running from love
Stop runningLyrics submitted by hannah
Different inflection when you say my name
Kiss me but your kiss dont taste the same
Is it real or am I going out of my mind
Curious bout the company that you keep
Cause I hear you talking bout her in your sleep
And now youve got me talking bout her in mine
Ooh and I bet she has it all
Bet shes beautiful like you like you
And I bet shes got that touch
Makes you fall in love like you like you
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick its like Im kissing her too
How does she touch you Can I try it too
I know youre twisted but baby Im twisted too
I wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind
With the smell of her perfume
I could love her too like you like you
And I can almost hear her laugh
Curving on her back for you for you
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick its like Im kissing her too
I can see her body rushing into you
Burning within burning so deep deep
On your skin skin next to me
Shes crashing on your skin
Settling in burning so deep deep
On your skin skin while you sleep uh
I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick its like Im kissing her too
I dive into the future
But Im blinded by the sun
Im reborn in every moment
So who knows what Ill become
I feel like Ive awakened lately
The chains around me are finally breaking
Im becoming my own salvation
Showing up no more hiding hiding
The light inside me is bursting shining
Its my my my time to butterfly
What Ive learned is so vital
Ill walk through the fire Ill begin again
Ill burn through my skin
Cause I cause I wanna feel it
Reaching for the truth not afraid to lose
What shattered through me like a rifle rifle was a revival revival yeah
I admit its been painful painful
But Ill be honest Im grateful grateful
Its my my my time to realize
What Ive learned is so vital
This wont take too long youll see
Im just tryna get to me ooh
What shattered through me like a rifle rifle was a revival
What Ive learned is so vital
What Ive learned is so vital
This is my revival This is a revival
You can stand beside the madness like a falling tear
You can hold onto the sadness like a souvenir
Or you can close your eyes and see your life
You can tap into the strength you never knew you had
You can breathe into your faith no matter where you’re at
Just close your eyes and change your life
Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind you can hover
You can rise like the tide like the heat in the summer
Yes I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
The earth can pull you down with all its gravity
And the measure of your worth is sometimes hard to see
So just hold on when the night is done
Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind you can hover
You can rise like the tide like the heat in the summer
Yes I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can
So even when your bones feel like weights
And it’s hard to lift the smile on your perfect face
You can still find a peaceful place
Close your eyes until youre floating up in outer space
It’ll be alright they’re just jealous of your highs
So they can knock you down but
Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind you can hover
You can rise like the tide like the heat in the summer
Yes I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
Like the air you can rise
Like the air you can rise
You see me standing there
And act like you dont know me
But last night you were calling me
Saying you want me
Oh why you always make me feel
Like Im the one thats crazy
You feel my heart racing
My my heart racing
Boy I need you here with me
We cant go on this way
Im falling hard for you
All I can say
Were going round round
Were never gonna stop going round round
Well never get where were going
Well youre gonna miss me
Cause Im getting dizzy going
Round round round
You come to pull me close
And whisper in my ear
You always told me lies
Ive cried out all my tears
I push my feelings to the side
But then you bring them back
Now you got me singing
Love me or love me not
Im staring at the clock
I pick them flower petals off
And then I watch them drop x2
Were never gonna stop going
Well never get where were going
Well youre gonna miss me

But the beginning of time for you and I
I cant believe that my body is still moving
It makes me feel like were doing something right
Baby when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy you keep my heartbeat skipping
When you touch me even though
The time is ticking away
Just tell me its not over
And well never reach the end
But when the night starts slipping away

Put your lips on mine
In the burning sunlight I
I cant believe that my body is still moving
It makes me feel like were doing something right
Baby when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy you keep my heartbeat skipping
When you touch me even though
The time is ticking away
Just tell me its not over
And well never reach the end
But when the night starts slipping away
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day
Oh eh oh eh oh eh oh ah ah ah ah x3
But dont close your eyes eyes eyes
Baby when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy you keep my heartbeat skipping
When you touch me even though
The time is ticking away
Just tell me its not over
And well never reach the end
But when the night starts slipping away
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day

If there’s something to fix
take it to another level
Get out on the floor
It can get a little crazy
When the kick hits the floor
Don’t knock it til you rock it
We can’t take it not more
Take it up a notch
I’ve got something to say
When you’re dancin’ whit me
It’s like we go MIA
Don’t knock it til you rock it
We can’t take it not more
Take it up a notch
You gotta change it up
And if the days not right
Just brush it off tonight
Your in my pocket mood
And when you’ve had enough
Take it up a notch
Shake it upLyrics submitted by ashley
You know fairytales dont come true
Not when it comes to you
Open up for the first time
And you can bet that its the last time
And Im cool with laying low
Saturday night and Im staying home
Im feeling good for the first time
Its been a while since the last time
Ill wave goodbye when you say hello
Im sick of the sleepless never ending nights
I just dont care who was wrong or right
Im sick of the rumors and the alibis
Ill cut you down to size
Sick of all of your little lies
Sick of all the girls by your side
What you dont know
Is how great it feels to let you go
I cracked your game its so see through
You know Im way too good for you
Moving on to the next time
Drop the baggage and Ill be fine
When its time to reminisce
Youre gonna realize you miss this
Youre on my mind for the last time
And at the most you were a past time
Ill wave goodbye when you say hello
Im sick of the sleepless never ending nights

I just dont care who was wrong or right
Im sick of the rumors and the alibis
Ill cut you down to size
Sick of all of your little lies
Sick of feeling bad by your side
What you dont know
Is how great it feels to let you go
And Ill throw those memories out the door
Sick of all of your little lies
Im sick of the sleepless never ending nights
I just dont care who was wrong or right
Im sick of the rumors and the alibis
Ill cut you down to size
Sick of all of your little lies
So Im getting on with my life
What you dont know
Is how great it feels
To let you goLyrics submitted by lexi

Mr TSA Im ready for inspection

We fall for each other at the wrong time
Only for a moment but I dont mind
Guess I dont know where to draw the line the line the line
And well play the same game every night
Yeah you know how to make me want you
Oh I know yeah I know its over
You dont know how to love me when youre sober
When the bottles done you pull me closer
And youre saying all the things that youre supposed to
But you dont know how to love me when youre sober
Why is it so different when we wake up
Same lips same kiss but not the same touch
Dont you know that you do it just enough but not enough
But I know whats next and I want so much
Yeah you know how to make me want you
Oh I know yeah I know its over
You dont know how to love me when youre sober
When the bottles done you pull me closer
And youre saying all the things that youre supposed to
But you dont know how to love me when youre sober
I know I should leave I know I should should should
But your loves too good your loves too good good good
I know I should leave I know I should should should
But your loves too good your loves too good good good
You dont know how to love me when youre sober
When the bottles done you pull me closer
And youre saying all the things that youre supposed to
But you dont know how to love me when youre sober
Youve got a hold on me
Youre like a wasted dream
But you dont know how to love me when youre sober
Wake up to your dreams
And watch them come true
Ill make you whisper my name Ill never leave the room
Night and day Ill be your muse
No other girl can make you feel the way I do
I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere so meet me under there
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you
Dont be afraid close your eyes
Let me take you to places youve never been tonight
I thought by know youd realize I can do anything I put my mind to
I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere so meet me under there
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you
Everything I touch turns to love
Everything I do will open up heaven
Its dead steady theres falling and flying in love
Nothings forever because we are just stars dance
I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere so meet me under there
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you
I can make the stars dance
I can make the stars dance
I can make I can make I can make the stars dance
The sky is everywhere so meet me under there

Wild wild wild wild wild
Wild wild wild wild wild
You built me from a broken heart
With bricks you made from broken parts
Youve fixed the paint so we could start
So now whats mine is ours
I still have proof in form of scars
The first time always falls so far
Those healing wounds heal twice as hard
But now whats mine is ours
But now whats mine is ours
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors of the wild
We kept each others shooting stars
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors we are survivors

You got me sippin on something
I cant compare to nothing
Ive ever known Im hoping
That after this fever Ill survive
I know Im acting a bit crazy
Strung out a little bit hazy
Hand over heart Im praying
That Im gonna make it out alive
The beds getting cold and youre not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But Im not alive until you call
And Ill bet the odds against it all
Save your advice cause I wont hear
You might be right but I dont care
Theres a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every seconds like torture
Hell over trip no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby baby no I cant escape
The beds getting cold and youre not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But Im not alive until you call
And Ill bet the odds against it all

Youre a sexy machine youre a hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Lets drop out of this crowd somewhere no ones allowed
All to myself I want you all to myself
You dont need no other lover we can keep it undercover
Find me in the shadows
And put the shades dow until tomorrow
And make sure that nonobody follows
You dont need no other lover we can keep it undercover
You dont need no other lover we can keep it undercover
I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark
And you can never get me like the math that you know by heart

Oh but even if I fall in love again
It could never be the way I loved you
making me feel so cold yeah
And I’ve been trying to make
But that makes it worse yeah
See I’m a wreck inside
My toung is tied and my

The future may be all I really need
And it might be wonderful yeah
It might be magical uh oh
It might be everything I’ve waited for
Oh but even if I fall in love again
It could never be the way I loved you
the one and only true love
wasn’t directly all over my taste yeah
I loved you like you loved me oh
Like something pure and holy
Like something that can never be replaced
And it was be wonderful
It was everything I’ve waited for
And if I should ever fall in love again
Oh It could never be the way
No It will never be the way
If Im with you for the night
Hope you dont mind
If you stay by my side
We can drive in your car
Pull over and watch the stars
We can dance We can sing
As long as Im with you
When we are together

Cause we sleep when we die

But I dont care I dont care
Well end up and thats okay

How nothing’s funny when it’s you

Keep you beneath the stars
Won’t let you touch the sky
