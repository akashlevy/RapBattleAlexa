Its okay its okay Im gonna make it anyway
Sometimes I just feel like
Why do I put up this fight
Why do I still write
Sometimes its hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skills like
Sometimes I just hate life
In case of the stage fright
Uhh But if I fall It aint my fault Breakin eyeballs My insides crawl
And I clam up SMASH
I just cant do it
My whole manhoods just been stripped
So I must been dipped
Man fuck this shit yo
Im goin the fuck home
Rollin my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Rd
Ima make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once Im over these tracks man
I dont like where Im goin
Aint no followin no footsteps
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd
Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
Fore I go back to the same crap SMASH
Mamas got a new man
Sits in front of the TV burys her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother her mother and dad
Aint no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Cuz I aint blew up yet
Its like I grew up but I aint grownin two nuts yet
Dont gotta rap my step
The pressures too much man
Im just tryin to do whats best
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I wont tell a lie
Not a moment goes by
That I dont pray to the sky
Please Im beggin you God
Please dont let me be pigeon holdin on regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
Yo Im tellin you dog
Im bailin this trailor tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
Say whenever you need me baby
But yo I gotta get out there
The only way I know
And Ima do that for you
On the second that I blow
Ill make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Rd
Ya gotta live it to feel it
If you didnt you wouldnt get it
Well see what the big deal is
Why it wasnt it still is
To be walkin this border line of Detroit citys limit
Its different its a certain significant certificate of authenticity
But its everything to me
Youve never seen heard smell or met an MC
Whos incredible and on the same pedistool as me
Sit on the porch with all my friends who kick dumb rhymes
And servin MCs in the lunch line
But when it comes crunch time
Where do my punch lines go
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I aint havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlit
Im startin to doubt shit
Im feelin a little scepticle
Of who I hang out with
I look like a bum
Yo my clothes aint about shit
Tryin to salvage and outfit
Tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like Im only stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up
And one thing I dont want
Is pity from no one
The city is no fun
Sometimes I feel like Im just being pulled apart
Being torn in my limbs
By each one of my friends
Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not what Im doin
My head is a stove top
The kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I dont got
Its time for me to UTurn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burnt
I can no longer play stupid
All I need is the courage
Like I already got to beat
All I need is the words
Suddenly a new verse of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders
I am no longer scared now
Im free as a bird
And I turn and cross over

Cause sometimes you feel tired Feel weak
And when you feel weak
You feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you
You gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that sht out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
No matter how bad you just wanna fall flat on your face
Till I collapse Im spilling these raps as long as you feel em
To the day that I drop youll never say that Im not killing them
Cause when I am not then Im a stop pinning them
And I am not hiphop and I just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop
Amoxacilin is just not real enough
The criminal cop killing hiphop filling minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
Your coming with me feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us
You hear it a lot lyrics the shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fck
Till the roof comes off till the lights go out
Till my legs give out can’t shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps
Ima rip this sht till my bone collapse
Till the roof comes off till the lights go out
Till my legs give out can’t shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out
Ima rip this sht till my bone collapse
Music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when your real
and you spit and people are feeling your sht
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
cause you may never get it again
So while you’re in it try to get as much sht as you can
and when your run is over just admit when its at its end
Cause Im at the end of my wits with half this sht that gets in
I got a list heres the order of my list that its in
It goes Reggie JayZ Tupac and Biggie Andre from Outcast Jada Kurupt Nas and then me
But in this industry Im the cause of a lot of envy so when I’m not put on this list the sht does not offend me
Thats why you see me walk around like nothings bothering me
Even though half you people got a fcking problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you’ve got to give me
The presss wet dream like Bobby and Whitney Nate hit me
Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC’s heart
what is he thinking How not to go against me Smart
And its absurd how people hang on every word
I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic I act like I’m an addict
I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers
But I don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I’m launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
Cause I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if Im not the baddest
give out from underneath me
Feels like no one could beat meLyrics submitted by David
Too late for the other side
Too late for the other side
I cant keep chasing em
Taking my life like that
I dont think she understands the sacrifices that I made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I wouldve stayed
But ive already wasted over half of my life I wouldve laid
Down and died for you I no longer cry for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
Imma take control of this relationship
Command it and imma be the boss of you now goddamnit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you totally devoted to you while ive stayed
Faithfull all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you I aint heard you yet
Not even once say you apreciate me I deserve respect
Ive done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this Ill no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
And I wont be coming back so dont hold your fucking breath
You know what youve done no need to go in depth
I told you youd be sorry if I fucking left
Id laugh while you wept
Hows it feel now yeah funny aint it you neglected me
Did me a favor though my spirit free youve set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
Too late for the other side
Too late for the other side
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that aint good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
All I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side
I have no life outside of that
Dont I give you enough of my time
You dont think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why im married to you still man I dont know
But tonight im serving you with papers
Go marry someone else and make em famous
And take away there freedom like you did to me
Treat em like you dont need them and they aint worthy of you
Feed em the same shit that you made me eat
Im moving on forget you oh
Now im special I aint felt special when I was with you
All I ever felt was dissed
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
And still I stick with this
Im sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
Your addicive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make em
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away from
To the pain the stress the drama
Im drawn to this so I guess imma mess
Im climbing out this abiss
You screaming as I walk out that ill be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list
Im leaving you my life sentence is served bitch
Too late for the other side
Too late for the other side

There is no escaping yoyooo
Theres no place to hideyoooyooo
Yes please someone save meyoyooo
But they dont pave no mind yooo yooo
Your walkin down a horror corridor
Its almost 4 in the mornin
So he can corner ya
Out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run
All you want is to rest
Cause you cant run anymore
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
Is watchin in the party applauding it
Here I sit while Im caught up in deep thought again
Contemplading my next plot again
In and out on the autumn and
Holdin onto the pill bottle then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at mcdonalds
Guess I must of just blacked out again
Its 3 am in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I dont remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Its 3 am in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I dont remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Sitting nude in my living room
I wonder whats on the tube
Maybe theyll show some boobs
Until I find hannah montana
Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin
Bust all over the wall panel and dismantlin
Every candle on top of the fire place
Grab my flannel and my bandana then
Kiss the naked manakin man again
You can see him standin in my
Whos use to usin hallicinogens
Cutting and bruising the skin
Raise the scissors and pins
Jesus when does it end
Phases that I go through
Dazed and Im so confused
Days that I dont know who
What am I gone do
Its 3 am in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I dont remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Its 3 am in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I dont remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
I duck and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I cant quite remember when I
Off a half pint of the jack
My last vic and a half
I remember the first time
I dismembered a family member
December I think it was
I was having drinks with my cuz
Pushed him into the stinkin tub
Cut him up into pieces
Then just when I went to drink his
I thought I outta drink this bath water
Thats when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me
That might be an artery son
Just dont seem to bother me none
So you should probably run
A secret passage way around here
Man theres got to be one
Oh no theres probably none
He can scream all that he wants
It aint no stoppin me from choppin him upup
Cause its 3 am in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I dont remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Its 3 am in the mornin

None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC you better become me

Yo some people say Im whack now if thats right
Im the freshest whack MC that you ever heard in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy Im the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold diggers succubus my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic Im like a dyke cant no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming bitch
We elevated to new heights premeditated
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MCs and I ate it
So I take it thats the reason Im hated
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MCs would not be impitant
But pimping it and acting like you could rock a show so
Harder than LLs Rock the Bells but you is a ho now
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blasterate and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered turned on like an appliance
Defiance no we wont have that
You want your shit to blow up
Well Ima stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hiphop
I drop beats and you aint singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldnt hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo you need to come with the real skills and act like you know
So what you know about a sweet MC in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see
EyeKyu Now what you know about a sweet MC from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be the sweet MC you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see
So what you know about a sweet MC in the 313
You dont know shit so when you see one flee
You can be RunD youll never beat the MC
Ill stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
Im sure your bound to agree a sweet MC crashes the spot
Ill make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot so just in case you dont remember me
Ill run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
Its either them or me man kill or be killed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans packed to capacity
Ill send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If hes acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldnt go out with a bang
I showered the slang simple as ABCs
Skip over the Ds and rock the microphone with Es
Dethrone MCs and Ima max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
Im greeted with flocks of fellow followers singers
You couldnt make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their
But you can bring yours lets see what you got
But dont front and never try to be what youre not
Cause you can be quick jump the candlestick burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill but you still aint Jack
So what you know about a sweet MC from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC youll never becomeLyrics submitted by tom
Its okay its okay Im gonna make it anyway
Sometimes I just feel like
Why do I put up this fight
Why do I still write
Sometimes its hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skills like
Sometimes I just hate life
In case of the stage fright
Uhh But if I fall It aint my fault Breakin eyeballs My insides crawl
And I clam up SMASH
I just cant do it
My whole manhoods just been stripped
So I must been dipped
Man fuck this shit yo
Im goin the fuck home
Rollin my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Rd
Ima make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once Im over these tracks man
I dont like where Im goin
Aint no followin no footsteps
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd
Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
Fore I go back to the same crap SMASH
Mamas got a new man
Sits in front of the TV burys her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother her mother and dad
Aint no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Cuz I aint blew up yet
Its like I grew up but I aint grownin two nuts yet
Dont gotta rap my step
The pressures too much man
Im just tryin to do whats best
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I wont tell a lie
Not a moment goes by
That I dont pray to the sky
Please Im beggin you God
Please dont let me be pigeon holdin on regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
Yo Im tellin you dog
Im bailin this trailor tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
Say whenever you need me baby
But yo I gotta get out there
The only way I know
And Ima do that for you
On the second that I blow
Ill make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Rd
Ya gotta live it to feel it
If you didnt you wouldnt get it
Well see what the big deal is
Why it wasnt it still is
To be walkin this border line of Detroit citys limit
Its different its a certain significant certificate of authenticity
But its everything to me
Youve never seen heard smell or met an MC
Whos incredible and on the same pedistool as me
Sit on the porch with all my friends who kick dumb rhymes
And servin MCs in the lunch line
But when it comes crunch time
Where do my punch lines go
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I aint havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlit
Im startin to doubt shit
Im feelin a little scepticle
Of who I hang out with
I look like a bum
Yo my clothes aint about shit
Tryin to salvage and outfit
Tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like Im only stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up
And one thing I dont want
Is pity from no one
The city is no fun
Sometimes I feel like Im just being pulled apart
Being torn in my limbs
By each one of my friends
Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not what Im doin
My head is a stove top
The kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I dont got
Its time for me to UTurn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burnt
I can no longer play stupid
All I need is the courage
Like I already got to beat
All I need is the words
Suddenly a new verse of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders
I am no longer scared now
Im free as a bird
And I turn and cross over
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd
Sometimes I just feel like quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight why do I still write
Sometimes its hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skills like
But Im still white sometimes I just hate life
Somethin aint right hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright drawin a blank like
Daduhduhdada it aint my fault
Great then I falls my insides crawl
and I clam up wham I just slam shut
I just cant do it my whole manhoods
just been stripped I have just been vicked
So I must then get off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit yo Im goin the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road
Im a man Ima make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once Im over these tracks man Ima never look back
8 Mile Road And Im gone I know right where Im goin
Sorry momma Im grown I must travel alone
aint gon follow the footsteps Im making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
Im walkin these train tracks tryin to regain back
the spirit I had fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant and the same pants
Tryin to chase rap gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan mommas got a new man
Poor little baby sister she dont understand
Sits in front of the TV buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Aint no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset cause I aint blew up yet
Its like I grew up but I aint grow me two nuts yet
Dont gotta rep my step dont got enough pep
The pressures too much man Im just tryin to do whats best

On everything I own Ill make it on my own
Off to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road
You gotta live it to feel it you didnt you wouldnt get it
Or see what the big deal is why it wasnt the skillest
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
Its different its a certain significance a certificate
of authenticity youd never even see
But its everything to me its my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
whos incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet Im still unsigned havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time where do my punchlines go
Who must I show to bust my flow
Where must I go who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I aint havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet Im startin to doubt shit
Im feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum yo my clothes aint about shit
At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit
And its cold tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like Im on stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up but one thing I dont want
is pity from no one the city is no fun
There is no sun and its so dark
Sometimes I feel like Im just bein pulled apart
From each one of my limbs by each on of my friends
Its enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot sometimes I just know not
what Im doin I just blow my head is a stove top
I just explode the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I dont got
But Ive learned its time for me to Uturn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Aint no fallin no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat all I need is the words
Got the urge suddenly its a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now Im free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road
Hi My name is what My name is who
My name is scratches Slim Shady
Hi My name is huh My name is what
My name is scratches Slim Shady
Can I have the attention of the class for one second
Hi kids Do you like violence Yeah yeah yeah
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids Uhhuh
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did Yeah yeah
Try cid and get fucked up worse that my life is Huh
My brains dead weight Im trying to get my head straight
But I cant figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate Ummmm
And Dr Dre said Slim Shady you a basehead
Uhuhhh So whys your face red Man you wasted
Well since age twelve Ive felt like Im someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lees tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Cmere slut Shady wait a minute thats my girl dog
I dont give a fuck God sent me to piss the world off
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot next semester Ill be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers Owwwwwwww
Walked in the strip club had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender then stuck my dick in the tip cup
In a space ship while they screaming at me LETS JUST BE FRIENDS
Ninetynine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do Damn
I told her Id grow up to be a famous rapper

Now I dont really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where Im gonna go
Still I ball like theres no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote
Your staring straight into a barrel of hate Terrible fate
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah youre late your train left
Mascara and eggs smeared on your face
I thought that I told ya the spilled nut aint nothing to cry over
Never shoulda came within Range of my Rover
Shoulda known i was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick whos dumb enough out there I blind fold her
She still comes back to my crib Must want me to mess with her mind hold up
She mustve took me for some high roller
But i wont buy her a soda Unless its rock n rye cola Faygos cheaper
Buy you a bag of fritos I wouldnt let u eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldnt dye for ya
Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars
You get your eyes swole up Im on my straight grizzly
So why would i buy you a gay ass teddy bear bitch youre already bipolar
Now I dont really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where Im gonna go
Still I ball like theres no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote
Man TIP told me on this hoe tip
Best tip I could give you to hip you
Never let these traits trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love slut shit
Take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
Shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick its you but fuck it TIP its cool
Im chillin like a Villain
Like the penguin in its fucking igloo eating fudgesicles
Id rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
before I tie a fucking knot Id tie you in one bitch
you think this is some Nintendo game how fucking dumb is you
Ill give you some mumps before I split some lump sums with you
So heres a penny for your thoughts but it wont buy you a cheeseburger although a nickle might just get you one pickle
Fuck it its official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue
theres a bombshell scud missile
Like I just cuss at you to fucking cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was some motherfucking stud
Slut this will teach you not to come drunk stumbling my way fo shizzle
I still live like I bought you the Gilbert slot checks stob bizzle
So fuck scissors these checkers are bust like a blood blister
Now I dont really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where Im gonna go
Still I ball like theres no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote
Yeah I guess life is a bitch aint it TIP
And each one thinks Say this shit
Shirt off my back I wouldnt give you the dirt off my handkerchief
Im giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
Im sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didnt
This is so bad put a sticky note to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock come racing in double time
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say Kmarts like theres an apostrophe S on it dog
And they say McDonalds isnt a restaurant well I guess Im wrong
But if you gonna tell me that the AW aint the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the F on dawg
Now I dont really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where Im gonna go
Still I ball like theres no tomorrow

Yeah cant stop now
This maybe the last chance I get to be famous
You dream of trading places I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches you run around defenceless
There is too much to lose You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous
But be careful what you wish for
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist they call me Slim Rothelsberger
I get beserker than a fed up post office worker
A murker with a mossberg Im pissed off get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter squirted a frankfurter
For a gangsta you should of shit your pants when you saw
The chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel
I faced her around when his fangs come out get your brains blown out
Thats what I call blowing your mind when I come back like nut on your spine
Im a thumbtac that you slept on son
Now here I come screaming attack like I just stepped on one
Lowering the totem til he showed em defiance giant scrotum
He dont owe them bitches shit his bridges he out wrote em
Hes so out cold hes knocked out at the south pole and
Nobody fucks with him rigamortis and postmortem
Hes dying of boredom take your best rhymes record em
Then try to thwart him hell take your punchlines and snort em
Shit stained drawers you gon fuck with the guy that licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips em in PF changs sauce
Games off homie hang it up like some crank calls
You think Im backing down you must be out your dang skulls
You dream of trading places I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches you run around defenceless
There is too much to lose You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous
But be careful what you wish for
Im back for revenge I lost the battle that aint happening again
Im at your throat like strep I step strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand some are distorting my memory
Some are wrote on a napkin do what I have to to win
Pulling out all stops any who touch a mic prior
Is not even Austin Powers how the fuck are they Mike Myers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the whacko for
I take a shit in his jackolantern then smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick dicks too short of a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism you prick
Dont call me the champ call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the challenger matter of fact I need a lawyer
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
Yall are Eminem backwards youre menimes
See hes in awholenother weight class his slugs your BBs
Your bean bag bullets youre full of it you were dissing his CDs
Laughed at Infinite now hes back like someone pissed in his wheeties
No peace treatys hes turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EPs got the attention of the might DRE
You dream of trading places I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches you run around defenceless
There is too much to lose You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous
But be careful what you wish for
Now there he goes in Dres studio cupping his balls
Screaming the wood off the panelling cussing the paint off the walls
Spewing his hate to these haters showing no love for these broads
He aint giving em shit hes scissor pinch a penny so hard
Hell leave a bruise on the brawn so dark
You can see the mark when it scars til Abraham Lincoln is screaming out AHHH
His metaphors and similies aint similar to them not at all
If they dont like they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by
Like David Carridy they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it hes fucking had it
Hes mad at the whole world so go to hell and build a snowman girl
The bullies become bullied the pussies get pushed
They better pull me take me back to 9th grade to school me
Cause I aint looking back only forward this whole spot blowing
Who coulda known hed grow to be a poet and not know it
And while Im being poetic let me get a stork
And raise the bar higher than my opinion of these women
So bare witness to some biblical shit
As the cold wind blowing this world aint gonna know what hit it he did it he made it hes finally famousLyrics submitted by Tim
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go bezerker than a fedup postoffice worker
A merk her with a Mossberg
Im pissed off get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
For a gangster you shoulda shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
But his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
Thats what I call blowing your mind
Like nut on your spine
That you slept on son
Now here I come screaming attack like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem till he showed em
He dont owe them bitches shit
His bridges he out growd em
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breath whenever you gone
Cant turn back now Im haunted
I lost a battle that aint happening again
Im at your throat like strep
I step strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand
Read some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pull at it all stops any who touch a mic priors
Not even Austin Powers how the fuck are they Mike Meyers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the whack before I take a shit in his JackOLantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick
Dicks too short a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentariani sm you prick
You call me the champ call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the challenger matter fact I need a lawyer
I displaced my clause with enough plaster
To make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like burn choyder
Youre the Eminem backwards youre minime
See hes in a whole nother weight class
He smokes your BBs you beat back bullets
Youre full of it you were just in his CDs
Left at Infinite now hes back like someone pissed in his wheaties
No peace treaties hes turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EPs got the attention of the mighty D R E
Im haunted Im dead your gone
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Wont finish what you started
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breath whenever you gone
Cant go back Im haunted
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought Id see it break
Never thought Id see it
Attention all units attention all units
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat we have an APB on a man with green hair
Hes armed with a knife I repeat hes armed with a knife
Proceed with caution watch your back fellas
He could be coming at your girlfriend next
Theres a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
Hell stab you with a sword dont be fooled by his charm
Hes probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm look for a man with green hair
Check at your girls house he was last seen there
Hes has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks
I make you think youre a backstabber
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a backstabber
Stay away from him he aint no good
We got the walkietalkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
Protectors and be sure that you stand close
Watch each others backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that hes wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys
I make you think youre a backstabber
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a backstabber
Stay away from him he aint no good
Im on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him unmercifully
For what he first did to me
Its sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
Im mad as hell on the trail of the tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
Give me your girlfriend or Im gonna kill ya
I make you think youre a backstabber
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a backstabber
Stay away from him he aint no good
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust and swinging at the spiderwebs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth then the lights in the place went
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where Im at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume
I make you think youre a backstabber
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a backstabber
Stay away from him he aint no good
Dealing with backstabbers there was one thing I learned
Theyre only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone
Attention all cars attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
Hes going back to the crazy home I repeat
Hes going back to the crazy home how about that
I make you think youre a backstabber
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a backstabber
Stay away from him he aint no good
I make you think youre a backstabber
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a backstabber
Stay away from him he aint no good
I make you think youre a backstabber
Hit a bitch snake from the back I make you think youre a backstabber
Stay away from him he aint no goodLyrics submitted by Scotty
It’s like Im in the dirt digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you it won’t work
All it takes is one song on the radio you’re right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burned spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I am coming for closure
Don’t suppose an explanation I’m owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh you thought it was over
You can just close the chapter
And go about your life like it was nothing
You ruined mine but you seem to be doing fine
I’d never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
bout to go through’s tougher than anything I have suffered
Can’t think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges mind is saying let it go fuck this
Heart is saying I will once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
Oh you had me pegged the first time
You cant see the truth
But its easier to justify
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
And to think I used to think you was the shit bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
Not this time you better go and get sewing kit bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow nitwit
Thought some time had past and I forget it forget it
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him Pretend he never existed
Maybe gone but hes not forgotten
And dont think cause hes been out the pictures so long
That Ive stopped the plottin and still aint coming to get ya
Youre wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him same shit you did to me
Have you any idea that shit Ive gone through
Feelings I harbor all this pain of resentment I hold on to
Not once you called to ask me how Im doing
Letters you dont respond to em
Fuck it Im coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you
The cause to my problems
My life is garbage and Im bout to take it out on you
Ive been driving around your side of the town
Like 9 frickin hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address park in your drive
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life
And its now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and Im ducking on the side of your house
See its sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But aint here for ya empathy I dont need your apology
Or your friendship of sympathy its revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential I peeked
Continue to peep still bent low
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way round to the back porch
Man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this
You dont plan for intruders before hand
Surprised to see me Cat got your tongue
Gag chloroform rag gag almost half of a lung
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Stick to the core plan drag to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans irony spectacular huh
Now whos a faggot you punk
And heres your Bronco hat you can have that shit back as they suck
Its just me you and the music now Slim
I hope you hear it we are in a car right now
Wait here comes my favorite lyric
Im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey heres a sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
Hows this for publicity stunt This should be fun
Last album now cause after this youll be officially done
Matthew Mitchell bitch I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
Since you love your city so much
I figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits town is quite near
I hope we dont get stopped no license I fear
That sirens I hear Guess 90 on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial
Slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car
Well gotta go almost at the bridge haha big bro its for you
Slim this is for him and Frank Ocean hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again
I also represent anyone normally seen on the end of these jokes of a beat
Im the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
Im your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
No its hopeless Im the denial that youre hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again
Backs to the wall I’m stacking up all them odds toilets cock
Yeah ‘cause I’m talking a lot of shit but I’m backing it all up
But in my head there’s a voice in the back and it hollas
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I’m the ringing in your ears
I’m the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I’m your time that’s almost up that you haven’t acknowledged
Grab for some water but I’m that pill that’s too jagged to swallow
I’m the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you every woman you insult there
With the doublestandards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mather’s the rapper’s persona’s have a facade and
Matthew and Stan’s just symbolic of you not knowing what you had until it’s gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them
Im the hindsight to say “I told you so”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
Im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don’t stop after they call you
The biggest laughing stock of rap who can’t call it quits
But it’s time to walk away
I’m ever guilt trip the baggage you had
But as you gather up all your possessions
If theres anything you have left to say
Unless it makes an impact dont bother
So before you rest your case
Better make sure youre packing a wallop
So one last time I’m back
Before it fades into black and it’s all over
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up the last Mathers’ left offLyrics submitted by Kamyab Tizro
People say that im a bad influence
I say the worlds already fucked im just addin to it
Cmon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it
Beam me up and land me in space
Ima sit on top of the world im here
And shit on brandy and mase
Scarier than a white journalist in a room with lauryn hill ahhh
But with a lot funnier plot
And people goin feel me cuz ima still be
The mad rapper whether i got money or not yup
As long as im on pills and i got plenty of pot
Ill be in a canoe paddlin makin fun of your yacht
But i would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in the source
And a wardrobe i can afford
Otherwise i might get sent up backstrike in a ford
And you wonder what the fuck i need more vicadive
Everybodys pissin me off even a no limit tank looks like
A middle finger sideways flippin me off
No shit im a grave danger to my health
Why else would i kill you and jump in a grave and bury myself
People say that im a bad influence
I say the worlds already fucked im just addin to it
Cmon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it
Im the illest rapper to hold the cordless patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
Im meaner in action than rosco beating james tar senior
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments ouch ouch
I grew up in the wild hood as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that i used as an excuse
And aint shit changed i kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that i failed 9th grade
You probably think that im a negative person
Dont be so sure of it
I dont promote violence i just encourage it cmon
I laugh at the sight of death
As i fall down a cement flight of steps ahhhh
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again
Shit why not blow your brain out
Fuck it you only live once you might as well die now
People say that im a bad influence
I say the worlds already fucked im just addin to it
Cmon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it
My basic disk will make you take a razor into your wrist
Make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains
Are rippin out your skull so bad
And sew you back and be a waste of stitches
Im not a role model i dont wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl and hailey jade is shadys business
And shadys just an alias i made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when gil was payin me to dishwash
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You may be gettin a bigger attitude than maybe kims got
And the shits almost got the same fate that gradys bitch got
I know that just the two of us would make you hate me this much
And just the two of us
That aint got shit to do with us and our personal life
Its just words on a mic
So you can call me a punk a pervert or a show business pig
But the funny shit is that i still go with the bitch
People say that im a bad influence
I say the worlds already fucked im just addin to it
Cmon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it

Lately Ive been hard to reach
Ive been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me
Im reaching out for you
Im just so fucking depressed I just cant seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises took my lumps fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
in order for me to pick the mic back up
I dont know how or why or when I ended up in this position Im in
Im startin to feel distant again so I decided to just pick this pen
Up to try to make an attempt to vent but I just cant admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet
And I know some shits so hard to swallow
but I just cant sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow but I know one fact Ill be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow Ill be one tough act to follow
Here today gone tomorrow but you got to walk a thousand miles
In my shoes just to see what its like to be me
Ill be you lets trade shoes just to see what itd be like to
Feel your pain you feel mine go inside eachothers minds
Just to see what we find look at shit through eachothers eyes
But dont let them say you aint beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
Dont let them say you aint beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
I think Im starting to lose my sense of humour
Everythings so tense and gloom I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room
Just as soon as I walk in Its like all eyes on me
so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that it then it opens the door for conversation
Im not looking for extra attention I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I dont need no fuckin man servant
tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of them aint even funny
Marshall youre so funny man you should be a comedian god damn
Unfortunately I am I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why dont you all sit down listen to the tale Im about to tell hell
We dont gotta trade our shoes and you aint gotta walk no thousand miles
In my shoes just to see what its like to be me
Ill be you lets trade shoes just to see what itd be like to
Feel your pain you feel mine go inside eachothers minds
Just to see what we find look at shit through eachothers eyes
But dont let them say you aint beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
Dont let them say you aint beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands were dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip them dont expect no help
Now I could of either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which Im placed in and get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never
I just wanted to fit in in every single place every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me keep making that face til it gets stuck like that
Meanwhile Im just standing there holding my tounge
Then I stuck my tounge on that frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson then
cause I wasnt trying to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story not just based off my description
Cause where you see it form where youre sitting
I guess we would have to walk a miles in eachothers shoes at least
What size you wear I wear 10s lets see if you can fit your feet
In my shoes just to see what its like to be me
Ill be you lets trade shoes just to see what itd be like to
Feel your pain you feel mine go inside eachothers minds
Just to see what we find look at shit through eachothers eyes
But dont let them say you aint beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
Dont let them say you aint beautiful
They can all get fucked just stay true to you
Lately Ive been hard to reach
Ive been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me
Im reaching out for you
Yeah to my babies stay strong dad will be home soon
And to the rest of the world God gave you them shoes to fit you
So put them on and wear them be yourself man
be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
dont ever let no one tell you you aint beautifulLyrics submitted by Elizabeth
I can feel the heat rising
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now Im on the inside
Im standing in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Find the light find the light find the light
Im standing in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Find the light find the light find the light
Yesterday was the tornado warning today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half you wake and lets wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and youre still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter its like an enormous a
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didnt poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses stopped to inhale cant even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast the more asserted
Never looking back may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve as you steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster lucky no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad its like they murdered your a
And threw dirt on your casket but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have you just converted to gasoline
And while youre burning the past standing at inferno and chant
Im standing in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Find the light find the light find the light
Im standing in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Find the light find the light find the light
So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time they take your heart and steal your life
And its as though you feel youve died because youve been killed inside
But yet youre still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because youre weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that youre seeking it begins to seep in
Thats the only thing keepin you from leapin off the motherfreaking deep in
And Im pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that youre willing
To forgive them even after all that s you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building youre sealed in
But youre fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof youre just chillin and you look down
Cause youre so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin
As time passes things change everyday
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow todays goin down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place
So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
Its like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But youve extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies you scream
Im standing in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Find the light find the light find the light
Im standing in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Find the light find the light find the light
Feel the burn watch the smoke as I turn
Rising a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly
Im standing in the flames
Its a beautiful kind of pain
Find the light find the light find the light

Now this shits about to kick off this party looks wack
Lets take it back to straight hiphop and start it from scratch
Im bout to bloody this track up everybody get back
Thats why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the rahag
Just like I did with addiction Im bout to kick it
Like a magician critics I turn to crickets
Got em still on the fence whether to pick it
But quick to get impaled when I tell em stick it
So sick Im looking pale well thats my pigment
Bout to go ham ya bish shout out to Kendrick
Lets bring it back to that vintage Slim bitch
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I dont mean Stimpys friend bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym bitch
Take your shoes off let your hair down and go berserk all night long
Grow your beard out just weird out and go berserk all night long
Were gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud cause its mayhem til the am
So baby make just like KFed and let yourself go let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Lifes too short to not go for broke
So everybody everybody go berzerk shake your body
Guess its just the way that Im dressed aint it
Khakis pressed Nike shoes just crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it aint
That aftershave or cologne that made Em just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game check mate
But girl your bodys banging jump me in dang bang bang
Yes sir Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kids rock baw with da baw dang dang
Ppppow chicka pow chicka wow wow
Got your gal blowin up a valvvvvalvalve
Aint slowin down throw in the towel tttowel towel
Dumb it down I dont know how how how how
At least I know that I dont know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Were gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud cause its mayhem til the am
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Lifes too short to not go for broke
So everybody everybody go berzerk get your vials
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
Lamar oh sorry yo we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though thats the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I aint got no money to borrow
But I am tryin to find a way to get you a loan car note
Oh Marshall Mathers shit head with a potty mouth
Get the bar soap lathered Kangols and Carheartless Cargos
Girl you’re fixin to get your heart broke don’t be absurd man
You birdbrain baby I ain’t called anybody baby since Birdman
Word Rick word man you heard but don’t be discouraged girl
This is your jam unless you got toe jam
Hook 2xLyrics submitted by Slither
Better watch out sucker now I got ya where I want ya
onslaught coming and Im packing in my lunch up
bunch a missile launcher and a bunch a contra
van van full of ganja now come on jump
man stop marchin marshall on my gotcha
doin’ the cha cha and the kucharcha with a quadriplegic
boogieing down to Frank Sinatra
Lyndsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya
who da knew the puda do ta me whats its done
such cynicism when this isn’t in my system
blunt hypnotism lift the spliff up to my lip son
so much on my hands i got to give my kids a fist pump
Christopher Reeves swimming in my swim trunks
Mister “help me” whats he said to me and then sunk
women skinning them and cutting them up in chunks
in comes the woman with cocoa butter skin ones
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill
skin em up hym em
sew em up in those kilts up in those kilts
upa upa up in those kilts
man you don’t want to go up in those hills
up in those hills uppa up in those hills
You better beware stay clear of buffalo bill buffalo bill
Always you can see em lurking in the hallways
carcasues of caucasion females in his draw space
how the hell did he fit em all in such a small space
hide em in the wall but how long will the dry wall take
well fck it then I got nothing but time I’ll wait
until its dries for the moment i guess your all safe
after I sand it and buff it I guess that I’ll paint
my chainsaw’s outta gas my regular saw aint
now here I come again damn stomach rumbling
you can even hear the evil spirits coming from within
someones in the back of my damn house rummaging
its a girl she looks pretty thin but I want to skin
been on the hunt again when will it ever end
Evelyn why you trying to fight you will never win
severing legs arms damn there goes another limb
pull the lever then trap door death is evident
Now what you know about Buffalo Bill
fcking hoe you better fcking hold still
make sure none of that lotion in that bucket don’t spill
cut em gut em and just keep stuffing those girls
man I think she had enough of those pills
sedate her then I wait her come back later just to clutch on those steel blades
braids baby when I cut ya dont squeal
I hate the loud noises I fcking told you
I keep hearing voices like
wouldn’t you like to go and get ya put ya knife
and push it right through it while ya put ya shishkebab skewer
into a barbecue or would ya do to her what you usually do to a girl who’s skins newer
In a World of Sin doer this is turning into a torment tournament of sorts
I”ll be sure to Gensu ya til there’s no more skin to ya
boo ya who ya think you fcking with
duck because here he comes again
Yo check it out its fucked up and I dont see either one of us budging
Im withholding my anger
Though Id like to be the strangler
Of this punkass little pussys puny neck
Its my right to insist
That he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect
Thats what he says to himself
As he uses magazines to trash me
As he sits with both feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed
And starts imagining things
And he just cant see that hes manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy
It just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He dont exist in this world
So he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins till he runs himself in a race
And its destroying him slowly
Cuz he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself
He has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now hes acting like a bully
So he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he cant pull me so hes mad
He has no choice but to scream
And raise his voice up at me
Cuz it annoys him to see that I aint scared
You aint no motherfucking bully
And I aint bowing to no motherfucking bully
I wont allow it aint no coward to no bully
Ill be damned if I dont stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionally
Now Im not trying to make no more enemies
Theres so many motherfuckers that just are
They just keep pounding at me
Now that Im down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja laughter
But his ass is such a puppet
Irv could stick his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But shookass Irvs on a string
And Irvs so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that hes so tough
And Murder Incs the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
But our buildings made out of bricks
So you aint taking out shit
I know you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull a race car
And it backfires in your face hard
Cuz you know we dont play that black and white shit
Plus this guy that you fucked
When you was ecstasied up
Was just a man whos dressed up as a white bitch
You must be taking to much E
Now what bothers me the most
About hiphop is we so close
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J
Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugs Slayed Son and Freaky Ta
Its like a neverending cycle
That just seems to come full circle
Everyones gotta be so fucking hard
Im not excluding myself
Cuz I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men
We learn to let shit go but then again
Theres only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold
When someone steps on our toes
Its no exception it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck
About Ja like he claims he does
Hed wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feeding him pills
So if that E doesnt kill him
Someone from GUnit will and I aint buzzed
Dawg Im talking to you straight
If the situation escalates
Any worse were gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap
I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Halies name
Irvine get your boy off that E
Get at me dawg
Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy internet computer hiphop head
Me and you Clef were gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and lets paint my ass
Hey mister would ya care to bare witness to
The asswhippin Im about to administer
To this asskissin little vaginal blister
Stanabis little Marshall Mathers sister
And in this corner we have the mister
Not havin it its the mad sinister
Dr Evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonist faggot dicksuckin
ExLL Cool J fan from Windsor
Im bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniffsta
You bastard I aint wanna have to diss ya
Canabis where the fuck you at I miss ya
Where for art thou Canibitch
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin with
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
Now at first I aint really understand the shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin in the BatMansion and relaxin
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
Its Canibitch on some Stan Lives shit
It creeped me out at first Man this is sick
For me being just a sick this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were tellin me shit
Like you respect me like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask how come I aint return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me
The fourth letter Slim you really startin to upset me
The fifth letter told me you were comin to get me
The sixth letter theres a bomb threat in our building
This crazy motherfuckers really tryin to kill me
So I went back and read the first few letters that said
Some shit about a message you left
Oh shit thats not an E thats an A
This dude wants to leave me a massage hes gay
Right away Im on the phone with Dr Dre
We got a bogey Marshall Im on the way
Where for art thou Canibitch
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin with
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada Oh Canibitch
So in two seconds flat Dres at my crib
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
Shit Oh Dre wait a mintue thats it
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost
We can fly over the border Lets go WOOSH
So were off to Toronto and were gainin speed
BOOSH What was that Oh Jermaine Dupri
Fuck It keep goin no time to waste
Wait backup hit him one more time in case
Okay fuck now hes draggin under the car
Oh well only 30 more thousand miles
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin to conversate
Just tryin to find a reason for the constant hate
And tryin to figure out what happened to Germaine Propaine
He couldnt have fell off that hard Aint no way
What happened to the way you was rappin when you was scandalous
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist
Plus he raps with his regular voice BOOSH BOOSH
BOOSH BOOSH What was that Pet Shop Boys
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin but his ass was rotted
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figure if I stick him with a fork hes done
So I stabbed him twice kept jabbin Christ
He wont die this guys like a battered wife
Hes like Kim he keeps comin back for more
But he wont fight back I cracked his jaw
Hold up Bis quit foldin up
Punch me in the chest Make my shoulders touch
Do somethin At least one punchline
Cmon till the meter reads 999
tynine percent of my fans are blonde
Bis cmon answer me man respond
Tell me bout the sun rain moon and stars
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars
Raw to the floor raw like Reservoir Dogs
Bite another line from Redmans song
Suddenly the stub from a dead mans arm
From a midget reaches out from under the car
Its JD this motherfucker wont die neither
Dre starts sprayin him with cans of ether
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again
Compton Detroit bitch Talk some shit again
Stomp him switch feet Stomp him switch again
Dre alright hes dead dog quit kickin him
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again Damn
He disappeared yo hes gone he did it again
Where for art thou Canibitch
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin with

And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
Shit Oh Dre wait a mintue thats it
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost
We can fly over the border Lets go WOOSH
So were off to Toronto and were gainin speed
BOOSH What was that Oh Jermaine Dupri
Fuck It keep goin no time to waste
Wait backup hit him one more time in case
Okay fuck now hes draggin under the car
Oh well only 30 more thousand miles
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin to conversate
Just tryin to find a reason for the constant hate
And tryin to figure out what happened to Germaine Propaine
He couldnt have fell off that hard Aint no way
What happened to the way you was rappin when you was scandalous
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist
Plus he raps with his regular voice BOOSH BOOSH
BOOSH BOOSH What was that Pet Shop Boys
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin but his ass was rotted
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figure if I stick him with a fork hes done
So I stabbed him twice kept jabbin Christ
He wont die this guys like a battered wife
Hes like Kim he keeps comin back for more
But he wont fight back I cracked his jaw
Hold up Bis quit foldin up
Punch me in the chest Make my shoulders touch
Do somethin At least one punchline
Cmon till the meter reads 999
tynine percent of my fans are blonde
Bis cmon answer me man respond
Tell me bout the sun rain moon and stars
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars
Raw to the floor raw like Reservoir Dogs
Bite another line from Redmans song
Suddenly the stub from a dead mans arm
From a midget reaches out from under the car
Its JD this motherfucker wont die neither
Dre starts sprayin him with cans of ether
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again
Compton Detroit bitch Talk some shit again
Stomp him switch feet Stomp him switch again
Dre alright hes dead dog quit kickin him
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again Damn
He disappeared yo hes gone he did it again
Where for art thou Canibitch
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin with
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada Oh CanibitchLyrics submitted by BYB
This is what I wished for
This isnt how I envisioned it
Fame to the point of imprisonment
I just this shitd be different
But something changed the minute that i got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it smell it started sniffing it
And it became my cocaine I just couldnt quit
I just wanted a little bit
Them it turned me to a monster
I was raking in the dough
Had the game hemmed up like a sowing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was no one for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in between
You either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a 3 then 3 years later they go back and rerate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didnt have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just aint pass yet
A couple more years that shitll be illmatic
And 8 years later Im still at it
A felona father sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk
So be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold
I said be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might ot know
What to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold
I got a letter from a fan that said
Hes been praying for me
Everyday and for some reason its been weighing on my mind heavy
Cause I dont read every letter I get
But some thing told me to go ahead and open it but
Why would someone pray for you when they dont know you
You didnt pray for me when i was local
And as i lay these vocals
I think of all the shit i had to go through
Just to get to where Im at
Ive already told you atleast a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but ive already got God on my side
And its been one hell of a ride hasnt it
Just watching it from an opposite stand point
Man boys got to look nuts
And thats the only word I can think of right now on how
Its just like a vibe you get
Go ahead and bop to it just watch what you wish for cause i got the shit
Repeat ChorusLyrics submitted by joe
You know technically im not even realy supposed to be here right now
so Fuck it I might as well do the most of it
Amen Amen Amen Amen repeated
some of us dont get a second chance
But I aint blowin this one
shit I feel like I can do it again now
Who can catch lighting in a bottle set fire to water
Comin out the nozzle on a fire hose cry it and swallow
Smash an hour glass grab the sand takes his hands and cup em
Spin around to freeze a clock take the hands of time and cuff em
Theres a storm comin that the weatherman couldnt predict
Ive start to ball prick you better flea cuz I get ticked
its a rap I was down when I was down I was kicked
I got up Im back to punch ya to the ground ya trick
Its a trap fuck my last CD that shits in my trash
Ill be God damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if its my last
You can die in a blink of an eye so betcha Ill last
So keep winkin and blowin kisses cuz ur flirtin with death
Im destroyin ur livelihood I aint just hurtin ur rep
I catch a flow and get goin
No remorse Im showin they slowin for no one knowin there is nothing you can do about it
Zeroin in on my target like a marksman the target is you
Ill shut your lane down if you can spot the parked in at 2
Arsenic flower lighter fluid saliva what can you do
Go get ur crew hype you up stand behind you like woooooooo
That boys hot enough to melt hell burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See you can hate him he dont blame you frankly he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him how bout you
He came to the ball in his wife beater lost his nike shoe
Its in ur ass hes in ur ass hes all up in ur psyche too
If I had a time machine
Music is my time machine
Fuck catchin lighting he struck it
Screamed shut up at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
Rewound the future to the present
Paused it dont ask how
Fuck the past motherfucker hes the shit right now
Cinderella man sent to fell Shady dey
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane
Raise hell from hell he came
But didnt come to bore you with this Cinderella story
nor did he come to do the same or cant afford to be a lamo in this day and age
And at this stage in the game mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say bye to the old HI to the new Que Sera
Consider it his last hurrah
The coupe de gras raise em high in the sky
People are tryin to bring this place alive
Thanks for bein patient I will make no more mistakes
shit my Potatoes baked homie the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin weed yea faggot the stakes are high
Shit I aint even supposed to be here by the grace of God
By the skin of my teeth and the hair on my nuts I skated by
Now yall are on in ice with ankle weights I hate to lie
Now how fuckin irritated are you how much in ur face am I
And there aint shit you can do but fear it
Proof is here in spirit and Im a spittin image I mirror it
When I stand near it ur pussy lyric I couldnt hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists
He came to the ball in his wife beater and lost his nike shoe
Its in ur ass hes in ur ass hes all up in ur psyche too

Just why you came back again you hate the fame
Love the game cold as ice you remain

Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know

All you gardeners freeze up put your hoes down shady ease up

Rap is a land fill drop the anvil
These are shoes that you can’t fill
shit the day that happens the world’ll stop spinning
And Michael J Fox’ll come to a stand still
During an earthquake urine in your face
Cause you’re fake ahh what the fuck that hurt wait
Ahh what the fuck I just got struck by lightening
Alright then I quit god I give up
Call it evil that men do lord forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins I cleanse you
You can repent but I warn you if you continue
To hell I’ll send you and just then the wind blew and I said
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I’m as cold as the cold wind blows

So long til then i drop the fucking bombs
Like I miss the pass when I went long
If you don’t like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along slut this slut that learn the words to the song
Oh bches don’t like that homie I’ll be nicer to women
When aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming
lyrics courtesy of killer hip hop dot com
Man I’m a cold soul I roll solo so
So don’t compare me to them other bums over there
It’s like apples to oranges peaches to plums yeah
I’m bananas pussy cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear you try to diss me I’ll slaughter you
I put that on everything like everyone does with autotune
That last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty below
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blobloblobloblobloblows

I don’t know I don’t know by I probably be this way til my dying day
I don’t know why I’m so I’m so cold beat bangs I don’t need to say
I guess this is how you made me
The moment you’ve all been waiting for
In this corner weighing 175 pounds
with a record of 17 rapes 400 assaults and 4 murders
the undisputed most diabolic villain in the world
So crack a bottle let your body waddle
Don’t act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
Uhoh Uhoh bitch3s hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where’s the rubbers Whose got the rubbers
I notice there’s so many of them
and there’s really not that many of us
And ladies love us my posse’s kicking up dust
It’s on till the break of dawn
and we’re starting this party from dusk
Back wit Andre the giant mister elephant tusk
Picture us you’ll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt Lick the fumunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
Its a must I redeem my name n haters get mushed
Bitch3s lust Man they love me when I lay in the cut
Fist the cup The lady gave her eighty some paper cut
Now picture us Its ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the sht
gets worse then worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect works every time
Every verse every line as simple as nursery rhymes
Its elementary The elephants have entered the room
I venture to say were the center of attention its true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here’s the signal
Of the bat symbol The platinum trio’s back on you hoes
So crack a bottle let your body waddle
Don’t act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uhoh Uhoh bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now wheres the rubbers Whose got the rubbers

Its on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk
Ladies and gentlemen Dr Dre
They see that low rider go by theyre like Oh my
You ain’t got to tell me why you’re sick cuz I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick em Dre
I’m an itch that they cant scratch they sick of me
But hey what else can I say I love LA
Cuz over and above all its just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I’ll be dammed just fcked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Lets cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl
Garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though
So crack a bottle let your body waddle
Don’t act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uhoh Uhoh bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now wheres the rubbers Whose got the rubbers
I notice there’s so many of them
and there’s really not that many of us
And ladies love usmy posses kicking up dust
Its on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk
And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent
The money ain’t a thang when you party with me
Its what we into its simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn’t believe
I’m the napalm the bomb the don i’m King Kong
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
I’m so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
Bring the shaun dawn burn marajauan do what you want
Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man i’m caking you know i don’t give a fck
I spend it like it don’t mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown

Fat ass burgundy bags classy sht Jimmy Cho shoes
I say move a bitch move
So crack a bottle let your body waddle

Cause we came here to set this party off right
And if they dont let us in thru the front well come thru the side
Cause I dont ever wanna leave the game without a least sayin good bye
So all my people on the left all my people on the right scream one last time
Get your ass up for the Doctor
One more time Get your ass up for the Doctor
come on now here we go
cliffhanger its another club banger
got you hangin on the edge of your seat
Times up games over you lose i win
bout to show these knuckle heads how to do this here
look whos got you goin crazy again
im a trend i set one every time im in
i go out and just come back in full circle again
if you a fad that means its something that we already had
but once your gone you dont come back
too bad youre off the map now
radar cant even find you
we stay on the grind
you slip we out grind you
you walk around mad you let your anger blind you
we walk around just playin the violin behind you
enough with all the pissin and moanin whinin and bitchin
sit observe listen youll learn if you pay attention
why im sittin multiplatinum later 3 diamond worldwide
were on the charts with a bullet and still climbin
When Dr Dre says Crunk you will get it crunk get it crunk crunk crunk
and when 50 Cent says Jump you will get on one foot and jump jump jump jump
Applause is tremendous we drop you all the senses
i dont gotta promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches
we keep the party rockin off the hinges
we aint showin off were just goin off popular consensus
but critics say that Doc is soft Doc is talk Doc is all washed up
knock it off Who the fuck is Doc impressin
Doc is this Doc is that
you got the wrong impression
you must be on the cockadock cause Doc left you all guessin
so DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record What
we gonna have this muthafucka hoppin in a second uh huh
thats why we always save the best cut last
to make the scratch and mix for it like fresh cut glass
We swam with the sharks wrestled with alligators
spoke to an generation of angry teenagers whom if it wasnt for rap
to bridge the gap may be raised to be racists
who may have never got to see our faces
grace the cover of Rollin Stone pages
broke down barriers of language and races
just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
to pass the mic dont need ta play back and forth like
the hot potato game or somethin
you know how we do we make the club jump everywhere we go
its no secret everybody know
when Dres involved theres plenty of money involved
and plenty honeys involved
its sunny Sundays and palm trees Cali
every day is just another party from The Valleys
all the way to the make my alleys lets rally
Hands up for the Grand Finale
now raise up out your seat Dres about to speak
blaze a pound of weed 6 days about the week
you can catch me in the studio bangin out the beatsta
provide ya with the heat that keep blazin out the speakers
so never say never cause Shady Aftermath together along with GUnit
records presents the return of the The Doc OShay
no one can do it better we tear that club up and leave without a shred of evidence
yeah haha Still Aftermath 2006
And dont worry bout that Detox Album its comin
We gonna make Dre do it Ha ha

As i fall deeper into a manic state
Im a prime canidate for the gene to recieve the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of night quil then i salivate
Start off with the night quil like i think ill just have a taste
Couple sips of that then i gradually graduate
Too a harder perscription drug called valium like ya thats great
I go to take just one and i end up like having eight
Now i need something in my stomach cuz i havent ate
Maybe ill grab a plate of nachos and ill have a steak
And youd think with all i have at stake
Look at my daughters face
Mommy somethings is wrong with dad i think
Hes acting weird again hes really begining to scare me
Wont shave his beard again and he pretends he doesnt hear me
And all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat
Sometimes i feel so alone
I just dont know feels like i been down this road before
So lonely and cold Its like something takes over me
Soon as i go home and close the door
kinda feels like deja vu I wanna get away from this place i do
But i cant and i wont say i tried but i know thats a lie cuz i dont
and why i just dont know
Maybe just a nice cold brew whats a beer
Thats the devil in my ear i been sober a fuckin year
And that fucker still talks to me he is all i can fuckin hear
Marshall come on well watch the game its the cowboys and buccaneers
And maybe if i just drink half ill be halfed buzzed for half of the time
Whos that mastermind behind that little line
With that kind of rational man i got half a mind
Too have another half of glass of wine sound acinine
But i never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch im about to fall
I missed the couch and down i go looking like a bouncing ball
Shit must have knocked me out cuz i aint feel the ground at all
Wow what the fuck happend last night where am i
Man fuck am i hungover and god damn i got a head ache
Shit half a vicodin why cant i
All systems ready for take off please stand by
Sometimes i feel so alone
I just dont know feels like i been down this road before
So lonely and cold Its like something takes over me
Soon as i go home and close the door
kinda feels like deja vu I wanna get away from this place i do
But i cant and i wont say i tried but i know thats a lie cuz i dont
and why i just dont know
So i take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh
A couple weeks go by it aint even like im getting high
now i need it just not to feel sick ya im getting by
Wouldnt even be taking this shit if deshaun didnt die
Oh ya theres an excuse you lose proof so you use
Theres new rules its cool if its helpin you to get through
Its twelve noon aint no harm in self inducing a snooze
What else is new fuck it what would elvis do in your shoes
now here i am 3 months later full blown relapse
Just get high untill the kids get home from two homes relax
And since im convinced that im insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so i take 3 naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day lets see
Thats an ambian each nap how many valium 3
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
Ok so now you see the reason how come he
Has taken 4 years just too put out an album b
See me and you we almost had the same outcome he
Cuz that christmas you know the nomonia thing
It was bolognya was it the methadone ya think
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
your vcr tape cases with you ambian cr great places to hide aint it
So you can lie to hailie im going beddy bye whitney baby good night elaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor
Sometimes i feel so alone
I just dont know feels like i been down this road before
So lonely and cold Its like something takes over me
Soon as i go home and close the door
kinda feels like deja vu I wanna get away from this place i do
But i cant and i wont say i tried but i know thats a lie cuz i dont
and why i just dont knowLyrics submitted by rick
feat Royce da 59 Big Sean Danny Brown Dej Loaf Trick Trick
Tell em if they want it they can come get that static
I swear I love my city I just want a little static
See me they salute me they aint ready for that static
I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And I think its changin a lot he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin or not
Its simple as the alphabet
He F with me that G shall surely see
He definitely is bout it its retail fraud hes weak
The honest gesture the trigger finger round the diamond tester we tail flaw with heat
The same soldier its me myself and I
Ridin round shootin my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover this aint the squash beef state
You thinkin makeup we thinkin Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagles an Aries coupe might as well ride by in an ambulance
My parachute like skydivin in Hammer pants
So call it siblin rivalry
Take his life call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin a grudge is like
Lettin somebody just live inside of your head rent free
Real talk I dont got time to evict these clowns
Yall niggas been bitches thats none of my business but I dont sip tea
Thats Nickel Ride around his block
All he knows is pitfalls thats why hes always climbin out his drop
I got a question Do you wanna ride or die
Boy I need no halves and halves I want the game in entirety
100 percent cut no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion
Dont worry man them bullets will still be at your ass firin
I still call it safe I would suck if I was umpirin
Boy I hit the beat I just treat that shit like a diary
Im offended if you hear my new shit and you aint rewindin me
Self made I never needed your bail or a wire see
Im never callin collect I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet
Plus Im so loyal that that paper boy is all that I fetch
Got the ball in my hand and the ball in the net
Bitch Im the D cant no offense dunk on me
Im Mr Big Shot these hoes get drunk off me
Im overrespected my mama gated communitys overprotected
So futuristic Im already over my next bitch
Reminiscin on listenin to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day Im hittin new primes
Now the stakes high niggas surprised at the new lines
Or takin down my number like you still aint got a new line
Nah its the same weve been laborin for years
I know it took way longer than nine months but fuck it its all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein a Beatle though
Dont want to I need to gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but aint peaceful
This is just part one wait til the sequel
Tell em if they want it they can come get that static
I swear I love my city I just want a little static
See me they salute me they aint ready for that static
Comin from them streets where they thirsty starvin to eat
Just a step away from felon thats why they call it the D
On your bleeder ho reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll but honor the Phantom stripper pole
Cause Im a Linwood nigga them young niggas say
Put a stack on your head youll bleed a lake on Grand River
And to think yall hood harder then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Molly
In a blink Ill hit your kisser bet you ass aint rememberin
They say my citys tougher than two fat bitches scissoring
So nigga Im a veteran retire my letterman
I had Ks in front ya school but I aint go to Kettering
Cough up a line 313 where Im from
Xan got me cross eyed like Bernstein’s son
And these niggas try to copy but I hold on this time
Its us vs them Detroit vs Everybody
Lately it seems as if its me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like AB filler
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing made me celebrate me
And if I may reiterate I aint even need a script
But I made it to radio eat a dick
I still never ABC the shit
Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it Im crazy Ill always be real
Dont make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from rampage
You crazy for me to flip
Whats makin you think I need a switch Cause Im Adrian Peterson
When hes raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track I spank like he just did
DETROIT I cant never leave this bitch
Sick of bein treated like me and shit
But Jesus I can just see why people quit callin me to do features
And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasnt me
I probably wouldnt want to play with me neither shit
Seems to be reachin this fever pitch
180 degrees in here trying to wait for the cedar chips
MCs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and genius this inconvenience
And for the record you wont want this kind of static in your life
When Im makin you cling to it
They consider tryna reinsulate yah when its maybe in for another crazy winter
Its so cold in the D it is as days begin to tick away
But aint this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde
Dont make me unleash this shit release this Pit
May even seem as if
Im yankin your chain a bit or maybe the way in which Im sayin shit
Is playin with your relation changin it
Its still the same and Shadys still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter
With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
Its like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety descent
Awaiting anyone who aint affiliated it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters when you came here
And I came to kill em
Tell em if they want it they can come get that static
I swear I love my city I just want a little static
See me they salute me they aint ready for that static
What up though its the godfather Trick Trick
You either ridin with us or gettin rolled on
That means Detroit vs Everybody
Hey Em let me get that instrumental
Take it down to the hood
Let the little hoodies get this remix crackin
Eminem Were gonna shove it up Ja Rules ass
Im about to get rid of some hoes its simple
I put the Murder Inc with lead and Im not talking about a pencil
Look at what the fuck you dun got into
I see you found your nitch youre just a bitch with a menstral
Claiming you a murderer and spelt it wrong
You put the E before the D because thats all you on
You on Pacs dick bitch you a replica guy if he were still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry bitch keep it real life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins 3 deals that another nigga got you they didnt see
And I aint playing your a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be praying on his cover cause he need it
And you niggas hating shut your mouths
Its just the real niggas aint buying that shit you put out
Doe Rae Me but we dont sing motherfuckers
So Murder Inc do your thing motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team who expects nothing less then R n B coming from that regime
Regime is a little extreme neck to neck with soldiers motherfucking marines
Ja sold his soul to sing we have witnessed teen on the TV screen chase the dream
Now that you embrace the green dont fuck with the triple beams
Youre a motherfucking actor slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billy Holiday how it happen
Artists with repituares saw him in action Pacs assassination
Def jam grabbed him told him reenact him youll go platinum
They seen it for sure I know that Afeni Shakur dont enjoy Jeffrey Atkins
Reenacting her boy saw him click clacking his toy
Match and destroy Shady slash Aftermath in Detroit motherfucker
Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da
Dont play me cause your washed up lost your spot
Mama say mama sa Macosaca
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
Doe Rae Me cause were hot and youre not
Going at me is the only shot you got
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
You can get popped after all that shit you talk
Now we can skip past the mean mugs get to the slugs
To grievance and the crying and intimate hugs
We dont take you serious nigga you shook
Youre half of a halfway crook nigga get off X dick go sing a hook nigga
And you cant replace the late great one and when your gone youll only be the late fake
Nigga please stick the script before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino you aint shit but a bitch fucking old ass ignorant innocent looking senior citizen
Built up slap you like renaissance sicitive wait a minute hold on
Is it me or do we look like a banana with braids and clothes on
A bitch made man now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream holla and curse and go ahead and respond
Pull that pen and pad up out of your purse
Slim set an impulse to get at the wanktas
He told me to let loose and spit at the ganstas
What up gotti were in this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the drama for stucky and bush stones
Whats wrong didnt think were strong with real niggas
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
This real witness you all aint caught the concept
Youre talking non sense to walking bomb threats
Contacts were blown by Benzetta in the Source
Threatening at the boss youre gonna see me on your porch
Now Ive got the nerve to try serve on us
But Detroit niggas curve and they stirs to bust
Do I gotta get my nigga bugs punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscience and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Whos behind ya Caddillac Pac or that transvestite that dress like a Lil Kim Fox
Your just like a little wind box when I press tight on the trigger of this glock
Thats right on the little shit you got left to help you eat
You not Pacs songs without laws will help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying to mock pac your mockavelli get your own identity
Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da
Dont EVER say my little girls name in a song again
Dont play me cause youre washed up lost your spot
Mama say mama sa Macosaca

Ill meet you down there
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend proof
That if I went gold Id go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum Id just laugh at him
Thats not happening that I cant fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
Im living in a house with a fucking elevator
Haters getting mad they done had enough of shady
You slay me nothing you say matters enough to touche me
Rappers try to play me they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsa that a fucking daisy
Thats a nono who even she knows dadas fucking crazy
Fucking animal cookoo bananas fucking A B
Maybe its because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think its cause of the way that I was brought up
But its all caught up to me now karmas in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesnt creep upon ya but it all does
You wouldnt listen man I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brains all haunted cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought itd come to this I ought to just be honest but
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend proof
That if I went gold Id go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum Id just laugh at him
Thats not happening that I cant fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
Im living in a house with a fucking elevator
Sorry Lance Mr Lambert and Aiken aint gonna make it
They get so mad when I call them both faggots
Its all these fucking voices in my head I cant take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up fore I shake it
Youre standing adjacent to Jasons last slut theyre facing
Together makes em a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the weiner schnitzel up his ass hopped away some
Body please stop the patient get the cops to mase him
Homie Im the sheisse pass Doctor Dre some
I cant leave the game I just cant walk away son
No nota now not a chance not today son
I cant believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussys queef all over the rap game naked
And use a leaf to clean up the crap stains feck it
I just keep saying the same exact saying check it
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend proof
That if I went gold Id go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum Id just laugh at him
Thats not happening that I cant fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
Later Im living in a house with a fucking elevator
Elevator in my house Ill smell ya later
I blew the fuck up a hamster in a microwaveI
Think about an escalator now steps I hate em
Told the neighbor step away then I just pepper sprayed em
Yeah for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker try now to sleep
Lie down motherfucker try countin sheep
And youre tryna find out why now theres beef
Mase in your face bitch cry now pussy
This is my house all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouses teeth
Then I shove em in the elevator take em to the top
Stand above emjust to cut the fucking cable let em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator get a pop
While I let em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with my friend proof
That if I went gold Id go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum Id just laugh at him
Thats not happening that I cant fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
Im living in a house with a fucking elevator
Fucking son of a bitch I cant believe this shit
This must be all that there is this must be it

Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwashers so big when Im pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it

Look if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip
Yo his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
There is vomit on his sweater already
But on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drops bombs but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words wont come out
Hes choking how Everybodys jokin now
The clocks run out times up over BLOW
Snap back to reality oh there goes gravity
Oh there goes Rabbit he choked hes so mad
But he wont give up that easy no he wont have it
He knows his whole backs to these ropes
It dont matter hes dope he knows that
But hes broke hes so sad that he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home
Thats when its back to the lab again yo
This whole rhapsody better go capture this moment
And hope it dont collapse on him
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go oh
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go oh
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
Souls escapin through this holes that is gaping
This world is mines for the taking
Make me king as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring
But superstardoms close to post mortem
It only grows harder homie grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows hes known as the Globetrotter
He knows hes grown farther from home hes no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold ya nose cuz here goes the cold water
These hoes dont want him no mo hes cold prada
They moved on to the next shmo who flows
Who nose dove and sold nada
And so the so proper
His toll it unfolds and I suppose its old partner
But the beat goes on
Duh duh doe duh doe dah dah dah dah
No more games Ima change for due called rage
Tear this muthafuckin roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin in the beginnin the mood all changed
Ive been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin and stepped writin the next cipher
Best believe somebodys payin the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I cant get by with my nine to five
And I cant provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz man these goddamn food stamps dont buy diapers
And theres no movie theres no Mekhi Pfifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And its gettin even harder tryin to feed and water
Caught up between bein a father and a premadonna
Baby momma drama screamin on her
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot
Another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point
Im like a snail Ive got to formulate a plot
Or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only muthafuckin option failures not
Momma love you but this trailers got to go
I cannot grow old in Salems Lot
So here I go its my shot
Cause maybe the only opportunity that I got
You can do anything you set your mind to manLyrics submitted by Sara

I representin the A town
Im comin from the A town
Soon as the song comes on
Knockin crowds off the floor
When I walks through the door
Act stupid and lose it
Sippin cognac between two beautiful
Two bitches at the club
Talk shit at your funeral
I came to get a buzz and crunk
Cause my temperature is thirty below
Im checkin the scene for new cunt
You know this thing dont stop till I say so
Keep that ass on the floor
You know this club dont close till I say so
Keep that ass on the flow
Keep that ass on the floor
Keep that ass on the floor

Your life if you wanna be wifey
So I can support you
And support you by any means

But we can leave the club tonight
Long as you know when I bust

Except what time your ride pickin you up
You know this thing dont stop till I say so
Keep that ass on the floor
You know this club dont close till I say so
Keep that ass on the flow
Keep that ass on the floor
Keep that ass on the floor
Go on and do somethin do somethin girl

Lately I really feel like I’m rolling for like Philly
I feel like I’m losing control of myself
I sincerely apologize if all that I sound like is I’m complaining
But life keeps on complicating an’ I’m debating
On leaving this world this evening even my girls
Can see I’m grievin’ I try and hide it
But I can’t why do I act like I’m all high and mighty
When inside I’m dying I am finally realizing I need help
I can’t do it by myself too weak 2 weeks I’ve been having ups and downs
Going through peaks and valleys dilly dallying
Around with the idea of ending the shit right here
I’m hatin’ my reflection I walk around the house tryin’ to fight mirrors
I can’t stand what I look like yeah I look fat but what do I care
I give a fuck only thing I fear is Hailie
I’m afraid if I close my eyes I might see her
I lock myself in the bedroom bathroom nappin’ at noon
Yeah dad’s in a bad mood he’s always snappin’ at you
Marshall what happened at you you can’t stop with these pills
And you’ve fallen off with your skills and your own fans are laughin’ at you
It become a problem you’re too pussy to tackle get up
Be a man stand a real man woulda had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out homie just swift out and bust
Nah it ain’t like Doody to do that
He wouldn’t fuckin’ shoot at nobody he fights first
But dwellin’ on it only makes the night worse
Now I’m poppin Vic’s perks and Methadone pills
Yeah Em tight verse you killed it
Fuckin’ drug dealers hang around me like “yes man”
And they gon’ do whatever I says when I says it
It’s in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin’ best friend so fuck it I guess then…
Don’t know what I’m gonna do
but I just keep on going through changes
My friends can’t understand this new me
That’s understandable man but think how bananas you’d be
You’d be an animal too if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody’s lookin’ at you what you want me to do
I’m startin’ to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame startin’ to give me an excuse to be at a all time low
I sit alone in my home theatre watchin’ the same damn DVD
Of the first tour the last tour he was still alive
And it hurt sore fast forward sleepin’ pills’ll make me feel alright
And if I’m still awake in the middle of the night
I just take a couple more yeah you’re motherfuckin’ right
I ain’t slowin’ down for no one I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma yeah homie come on dole em out
Daddy don’t you die on me daddy better hold your ground
Fuck don’t I know the sound of that voice
Yeah baby hold me down
Wake up in the hospital full of tubes plus somehow I’m pullin’ through
Swear when I come back I’ma be bulletproof
I’ma do it just for Proof I think I should state a few
Facts cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through
I think about the things I would never got to say to you
I’d never get to make it right so here’s what I came to do
Hailie this one is for you Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother that’ll never change
Think about her every day we just could never get it together
Hey wish there was a better way for me to say it
But I swear on everything I’d do anything for her on anyday
There are just too many things to explain when it rains
Guess it pours yes it does wish there wasn’t any pain
But I can’t pretend there ain’t I ain’t placin’ any blame
I ain’t pointin’ fingers heaven knows I never been a saint
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history
But just today I looked at your picture almost hate to say
I miss you self consciously wish it didn’t end this way
But I just had to get away don’t know why
I don’t know what else to say I guess I’m…
Feels like a close its coming to
Fuck am I gonna do
Its too late to start over
This is the only thing I thing I know
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called Hi My Name Is dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent of a modernday Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment dog
Had to change my style they said Im way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that Ive went against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldnt amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game I pondered
I just wanna play my part should I make waves or not
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I dont wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin its your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah
Feel like Ive already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme
What I really wanna say is if theres anyone else that can relate to my story
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to…
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out
Afraid Id never be found
I dont wanna go another round
An angry mans power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear the time is near
Guts over fear I shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear guts over fear
Feels like a close its coming to
Fuck am I gonna do
Its too late to start over
This is the only thing I thing I know
I know what its like I was there once single parents
Hate your appearance did you struggle to find your place in this world
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasnt until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain Ive caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
And the lights go out in that trailer park
And the window is closing and theres nowhere else that I can go with flows
And Im frozen cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same old song
But Id rather make Not Afraid 2 than make another motherfucking We Made You uh
Now I dont wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
Cause I cant explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you ma cause that gave me the
So when they empty that stadium
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who alls they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her anyone similar you are the reason that I made this song
And everything youre scared to say dont be afraid to say no more
From this day forward just let them aholes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when Im gone
And to think I was gone
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way ooout
Afraid Id never be found
I dont wanna go another round
An angry mans power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear the time is near
Guts over fear I shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear guts over fear
Mom I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and Im fucked up
And Mom I know hes not around
But dont you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink yeah
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
Never thinking about who what I said hurt in what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far
Cleaning Out My Closet and all them other songs
But regardless I dont hate you cause Ma
Youre still beautiful to me cause youre my mom
Though far be it for you to be calling my house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb equivalent to Chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree dont mean shit to me
Youre kicking me out Its 15 degrees and its Christmas Eve little prick just leave
Ma let me grab my fucking coat anything to have each others goats
Why we always at each others throats
Especially when dad he fucked us both
Were in the same fucking boat youd think that itd make us close nope
Further away it drove us but together headlights shine a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go back to grandmas house its straight up the road
And I was the man of the house the oldest so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
And thats when I realized you were sick and it wasnt fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though but
Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
Cause you aint even get to witness your grand babies grow
But Im sorry Mama for Cleaning Out My Closet at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so never meant that far to take it though
cause now I know its not your fault and Im not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time its on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medications taken over
And your mental states deteriorating slow
And Im way too old to cry that shits painful though
But Ma I forgive you so does Nathan yo
All you did all you said you did your best to raise us both
Foster care that cross you bear few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you Debbie Mathers oh what a tangled web we have
cause one thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But Id have flipped every mattress every rock and desert cactus
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa kidnap them
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me her and Nate we introduced you hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths
And I saw your headlights as I looked back
And Im mad I didnt get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So Mom please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest
I hope I get the chance to lay it before Im dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt I guess were crashing
So if Im not dreaming I hope you get this message that Ill always love you from afar
I want a new life start over
One without a cause clean slate
So Im coming home tonight yeah
Well no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew cant wake me up
Well just know that Im alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh even if theres songs to sing
Well my children will carry me
Just know that Im alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girl
So I never say Goodbye cruel world
Just know that Im alright
I am not afraid to die
I want a new life
I want you to understand something
that when I come up in this btch I want the fans jumping
I want the fist pumping in the air
I dont look like a millionnaire
but I feel like a million bucks

try to restrain us you cant contain us
we still gonna make a statement no matter what we do
everywhere we go it seems were looking for any excuse to just cut loose
so this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
This is when shts hits the fan

A murderer in the flow liquid courage im finna blow

Hello Hello allow me to introduce myself myself
So nice to meet you So nice to meet you
Its been a long time long time sorry Ive been away so long so long
I never meant to leave you Never meant to leave you
You see that chick in the gym checking me out
Any second Im bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a Ill and Im wrecklessly wrecking the house
That was suppose to be wreckless where the heck is it now
Heres the necklace I lost right next to Stephanies blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Maybe somewhere in the depths of your couch
Oh Jackpot Yea Open Sesame mouth
Down the hatchet the feeling you cant match it
A raptaptap on your door with the damn wratchet
A tattactac in the hall with the damn hatchet
A napsackpacked with like 40some Zanexs
Shorty come back Im tryin to score me some lapdances
Im bout to relapse so maybe pour me some Jack Daniels
Formula 4040 and 40s with mad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch and back atya
Well I dont mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And are you menstruating baby my lil friends waiting to say Hello
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty shakin like Jello
Girl I dont mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
My equilibrium is off must me the Lithium
I dont need to buy any drugs man people give me em
It just becomes everyday extracurriculum
No reason in particular it was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
51 people asleep in my damn living room
Scuse me hun But what is your name Liddyyoung
I want up next to ya naked and uh did we umm
Of course we did but didnt I strap Jimmy hun
Im looking for the torn wrapper but there dont seem to be one
No offense baby girl I dont mean any harm
But disease is something Im trying to keep my penis free from
I find the fact that you Im cool I immediately run like Speedy Gon
Zalez to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of threes Im fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum
Well I dont mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And do you happen to have anything on you that make my mood mellow
Some are open and some are pink some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I dont mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
Oh those were the days they certainly were
Its hurtin me to know that Ill be closing that curtain for good
I second that and a third rush to emergency sur
gery to try to flush me because of the drugs that he purged
Hes sees the loner getting the threehundred bucks for these Percagains
Busters getting to be where he lustfully surged it in
Pain it hitting his knee and his muscles be hurtin him
Childishly on the phone tryin to rustle up muscle relax
ants for his back and a couple of packs
Since now hes doubling backwards and he stumblin back
Slipped and fell hit his backbone heard something go crack
Now hes up in the bathroom like hes busting a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
Im just busting my own chops while Im bustin a rap
Resuscitated and rejuiced so fuck it Im back
Hello Hello allow me to introduce myself myself
So nice to meet you So nice to meet you
Its been a long time long time sorry Ive been away so long so long
I never meant to leave you Never meant to leave youLyrics submitted by Leandra
Take this 2 guns cock
You ready 1 2 3 2 shots
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me I just love you more
You dont want me I just want you more
I buy you flowers you throw em at me
I know its sad but its making me happy
The more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
Cause you love me and I love you more
Its sick but who could ever predict
Wed be doin the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we dont
We do it for us its lust
Cause neither one of us trusts each other
So we fuck til we bust
Then we cuss each other out
We know what its about
Shout til I throw you out the house
You throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch
Punch you in the mouth
Fist fight til we turn this mother OUT
Were back in the same chapter again
And its sad but its true
When Im layin here with you
There aint nothin anyone could ever say ever do
Cause I hate you do you hate me
Good cause youre so fuckin beautiful when youre angry
It makes me wanna just take you
And just throw you on the bed
And fuck you like I dont even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You a slut but Im equal Im a mutt
Were both evil in our ways
But neither one of us would ever admit it
Cause one of us would have one up on the other
We can make accusations people spread rumors
But they aint got proof
Til they do its just the two of us
Its you and me cause any chick can say that shes screwin me
But you gotta believe me to a degree
Cause true indeed if you didnt I wouldnt be hittin it
Yeah I would cause the sex is too damn good
If I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm
So its off and on usually more off than on
But at least we know that we share this common bond
Youre the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope the only reason that I cope
Is cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that
I could never understand it
Thats why I dont try
From junior high until we both die
Its silly ho why must we try
Is it really so rough
That we must always call each others billy goats gruff
Try to pull each others legs
Thats the beauty of it yeah
Cause we truly love each other
Thats why we always fight
And all we do is shove each other
And its clear it aint gonna change
We both feel like weve been upstaged by someone else
Problem is neither one wants help
Its an addiction and it cant be fixed
Theres a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle dont fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesnt know shit
And theyre probably just tired of hearin it all the time
On every song every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoopla all of the whoopdy whoop
What you put me through fuckin whoopdy doo
But I wont be made a fool of
If this is true love
You do it again Im fucking you up
What you say what you do
Ima hunt you down til I find you
No matter where you run Ill be right there
Right behind you in your nightmares
All the flowers and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
You told me you hate me youre gonna hate me more
When you find out cant escape me whore
Oh yeah this is Eminem baby back up in that motherfucking ass
One time for your motherfucking mind we represent the 313
You know what Im saying cause they dont know shit about this
Aiyyo my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin cause they be actin maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son you mainly lack attraction
You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
Im sliming pills or roaches we sprayed and disinfects
and twist the necks of rappers till their spinal column disconnects
We disinfect then check the monologue turn your system up
Twist them up and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
Hits a snare and bass in a track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion there aint no time to be stare and gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now Im trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat Im tempted to make another attempt at it
Bust it I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince some fruit to stompand then two feet to rinse
I greet intensive ladies I spoil all your fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MCs are feeble I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MCs and stand the only one
Imitator Intimidator Stimulator Simulator of data Eliminator
Theres never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My a capella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis
And eases you mentally gently sentimentally instrumentally
With entity dementedly meant to be Infinite
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now Im trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat Im tempted to make another attempt at it
Man I got evidence Im never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the MO
So Im assuming all responsibility
Cause theres a monster will in me that always wants to kill MCs
Mic messaler slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is speacialer My skill is intergalactical
I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool it wasnt practical
Id rather let a tractical tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact I cant see or cant imagine
A man who aint a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
This is for my family the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be cause once you make an instant hit
Im tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now Im trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat Im tempted to make another attempt at it

I was born with a dick in my brain
Yea fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
Til one night he snuck in and said
Were going out back I want my dick sucked in the shed
Cant we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead
After I fuck you in the butt get some head
Bust a nut get some rest
The next day my mother said
I dont know what the fucks up with this kid
The bastard wont even eat nothing he scared
He just hung himself in the bedroom hes dead
Debby dont let that fucker get you upset
Go in there stick a fucking cigarette to his neck
I bet you hes faking it
I bet you Ill bet he prolly wants to see how upset you would get
Ill go handle this of course unless you object
Ah go fuck his brains out if any is left in his head
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know Ive completely lost it
Is he nuts No hes insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know Ive completely lost it
Is he nuts No hes insane
You get it No I just tried to bite my face off
I just got fucking chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw bit the fucking blades off
Ate the blades stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face let the thing pop
Took his eye out picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfuckers got nuts like king kong
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he layed all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants he took every fucking thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
Aint he raw Yea maniac that Shady dog
Man that motherfuckers gangsta aint he dog
Shady dog what be going through that fucking brain of yours
Say no more what the fuck you waiting for Sing along

And check out the man he goes by the name of er
Slim Shady brain dead like Jim Brady
Im a M80 you Lil like that Kim lady
Im buzzin Dirty Dozen naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You aint gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it fuck it while we coming out in the open
Im doing acid crack smack coke and smocking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers Im an alcoholic Hi Marshall
I have a disease and they dont know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause Im coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch Im coming out swinging so fast itll make your eyes spin
You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The Proof is in the puddin just ask the Deshaun Holton
Ill slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screaming Fuck the World like Tupac
I just dont give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back dirty mackin
telling your boys that Im on crack
I just dont give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just dont give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon get stuck stoned and snuffed
Cause I just dont give a fuck
Im Nicer than Pete but Im on a Search to crush a Miilkbone
Im Everlasting I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
Im ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
Im colder than snow season when its twenty below friezing
Flavor with no seasoning this is the sneak preview
Ill diss your magazine and still wont get a weak review
Ill make your freak leave you smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady Eminem was the old initials Byebye
Pathological liar blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest zaniest spontaneous sporadic
Impulsive thinker compulsive drinker addict
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an Afghan
Somebody let me out this limousine hey let me out
Im a caged demon on stage screaming like Rage Against the Machine
Im convinced Im a fiend shootin up while this record is spinning
Clinically brain dead I dont need a second opinion
Fuck droppin the jewel Im flippin the sacred treasure
Ill bite your motherfucking style just to make it fresher
I cant take the pressure Im sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while Im washing dishes
In school I never said much too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam thats when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade raped the womens swim team
Dont take me for a joke Im no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snorting coke and smocking weed again
Im going up over the curb driving on the median
Finally made it home but I dont got the key to get in

Okay children quiet down quiet down
Children Id like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
His name is Mr Shady
Chidren quiet down please
Brian dont throw that shut up
Mr Shady will be your new substitute while Mr Kaniff is out with Pneumonia hes got AIDS
Good luck Mr Shady
Hi there little boys and girls fuck you
Today were going to learn how to poison squirrels
But first Id like you to meet my friend Bob huh
Bobs 30 and still lives with his mom
He dont got a job cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When its late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drags them into the woods and goes straight to the chopping block
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be just so afraid theyd drop the charge
Til one night Mrs Stacy went off the job
When she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk
But Stacy knew it was Bob and said knock it off
But Bob wouldnt knock it off cause hes crazy and off his rocker
Crazy good as Slim Shady is off the block uh
You couldnt even take him to Dres to give Bob a doctor
Grabbed Stacy by the legs and chopped them off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacy went off the job they never found her
And Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And thats the story of Bob and his marijuana
Doing what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels warned you its bad for you
See children drugs are bad come on
And if you dont believe me ask your dad raise your hand
And if you dont believe him ask your mom thats right
Shell tell you how she does him all the time she will
So kids say no to drugs thats right
So you dont act like everyone else does uh huh
And theres really nothing else to say sing along
Drugs are just bad mkay
My penis is the size of a peanut
Have you seen it
Fuck no you aint seen it
It the size of a peanut huh
You know what else is bad for squirrels
Esctasy its the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you dont do it
Kids two hitsll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final you wont get it back
So dont get attatched itll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach 21 years old
After hanging out with some friends at a frat party he gets bold
And decides to try five when hes bribed by five guys
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull
His back arches up looks like the McDonalds arches
Hes on Donalds carpet
And everyone in the apartment starts laughing at him
Hey Adam Zach is a jackass look at him
And they took it too so they think its funny
So theyre laughing at basically nothing
Except maybe wasting their money
Meanwhile Zachs in a coma
The action is over and his back and his shoulders hunched up like hes practicing yoga
And thats the story of Zach The Ecstasy maniac
so dont eat that the squirrels say its bad for you
See children drugs are bad thats right
And if you dont believe me ask your dad thats right
And if you dont believe him ask your mom you can
Shell tell you how she does him all the time she will
So kids say no to drugs smoke crack
So you dont act like everyone else does thats right
And theres really nothing else to say uh huh
Drugs are just bad mkay
And last but not least
One of the most humongous
Problems among young people today is fungus
It grows from cow manure
They pick it out wipe if off bag it up
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it
And then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of em
And sometimes you see things that arent there like what
Like fat women in gstrings with orange hair
Mr Shady whats a gstring
Its yarn Clair women stick them up their behinds go out and wear them
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops did I say magic mushrooms I meant fungus
All swolled up like a cows tongue How come
Cause it comes from a cows dung
See drugs are bad its a common fact
But your mom and dad know
Thats all that Im good at
But dont be me
Cause if you grow up and go and OD
Theyre gonna come for me and Im gonna have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide
Cause itll be my fault
So dont drugs and do exactly as I dont because Im bad for you
See children drugs are bad uh huh
And if you dont believe me ask your dad put that down
And if you dont believe him ask your mom you can ask
Shell tell you how she does him all the time and she will
So kids say no to drugs say no
So you dont act like everyone else does like I do
And theres really nothing else to say thats right
Drugs are just bad mkay
Sing along children Suck my motherfuckin dick
Drugs are just bad drugs are just badSouth Park is gonna sue me
So dont do drugs Suck my motherfuckin penis
so therell be more for me Hippie God damnit

Tell me where to go tell me what to do
Ill be right there for you
Tell me what to say no matter if its true
Ill say it all for you
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired Am I a martian
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
Because I dont belong in this world
That’s why Im scoffing at authority defying often
Flying off at the handle with my mom no dad
So I’m non complying at home at school I’m just shy and awkward
And no I don’t need no goddamn psychologist
Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve them
I’m outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself
Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet
Trying not to be noticed because Im crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I aint talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
And he said that I eyeballed him
And if you fall Ill get you there
Ill be your savior from
All the wars that are fought
Please have faith in my words
Cause this is my legacy legacy here
This is my legacy legacy here
There’s no guarantee it’s not up to me you can only see
This is my legacy legacy
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired in my nogging
Cause sporadic as my thoughts come its mind boggling
Cause I obsess on everything and my mind is small shit
Bothers me but now my father he said sayonara and then split
But I don’t give a shit Im fine as long as
Theres batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
Shit look at the bright side at least I ain’t walking
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten speed which Ive acquired parts that I
Found in the garbage a frame and put tires on it
Headphones on straight ahead and kids tryin to start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even try and put up a fight its nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about those rhymes Ive been jottin
They are kinda giving me confidence
Instead of tryina escape through my comics
Why dont I just blast a little something like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like thats right fights on bitch
Who wouldve knew from the moment I turned the mic on
I could be iconic and my conquest is
Is word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest
This is my legacy legacy here
This is my legacy legacy here
There’s no guarantee it’s not up to me you can only see
This is my legacy legacy
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Now I think the fact that Im differently wireds awesome
Cause if I wasnt I wouldnt be able to work
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemys words as strength
To try and draw from and get inspired off em
Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
Now you shut up bitch I am talking
Thought I was full of horseshit and now
You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
Me against the world so what Im Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
Its the body bag game bitch Im supplying coffins
Cause you dicks butt kiss a bunch of Brian Baldingers
You gon die a ball licker Ive been diabolical
With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
You dont respect the legacy I leave behind yall can
Suck a dick the day you beat me pigsll fly out my ass
And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I aint halting
Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I am me Im a fire marshall and this is my
This is my legacy legacy here
There’s no guarantee it’s not up to me you can only see
This is my legacy legacy

Step by step heart to heart left right left
Step by step heart to heart left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
Im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I aint never supposed to show it my crew aint supposed to know it
Even if it means goin toe to toe with a Benzino it dont matter
Id never drag them in battles that I cant handle unless I absolutely have to
Im supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em
If some shit ever does pop off Im supposed to be beside em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
Theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailies name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy this shit went way beyond some Jayz and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it honestly Im exhausted
And Im so caught in it I almost feel Im the one who caused it
This aint what Im in hiphop for its not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasnt my intentions my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin Suge
And that was just out of respect for not runnin my mouth
And talkin about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef
So I did I just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
While hes all over tv down talkin a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it i understand this is business
And this shit just isnt none of my business
But still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute cause
Step by step heart to heart left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin
But now its elevated cause once you put someones kids in it
The shit gets escalated it aint just words no more is it
Its a different ball game callin names and you aint just rappin
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin
Me and Dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash em mash em and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention is pullin in other directions
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that Ill be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now hes fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin
Well fuck it that motherfucker can get it too fuck him then
But Im so busy being pissed off I dont stop to think
That we just inherited 50s beef with Murder Inc
And hes inherited mine which is fine aint like either of us mind
We still have soldiers thats on the front line
Thats willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us strictly to show they support us
Well maybe shout em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show them we love em back and let em know how important it is
To have Runyan Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I aint tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
It aint worth it I cant think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love yall too much to see the verdict
Ill walk away from it all before I let it go any further
But dont get it twisted its not a plea that Im coppin
Im just willin to be the bigger man
If yall can quit poppin off at the jaws well then I can
Cause frankly Im sick of talkin
Im not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cause
Step by step heart to heart left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit torn apart we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiersLyrics submitted by terri
Look if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wantedOne moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip
His palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy
Theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti
Hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgettin
What he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words wont come out
Hes choking how everybodys joking now
The clocks run out times up over bloah
Snap back to reality Oh there goes gravity
Oh there goes Rabbit he choked
Hes so mad but he wont give up that
He wont have it he knows his whole backs to these ropes
It dont matter hes dope
He knows that but hes broke
Hes so stagnant that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home thats when its
Back to the lab again yo
He better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him
You better lose yourself in the music the moment
You own it you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
The souls escaping through this hole that its gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring but superstardoms close to post mortem
It only grows harder only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows hes know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads God only knows
Hes grown farther from home hes no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
His hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose its old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da
No more games Ima change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepwritin the next cypher
Best believe somebodys paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I cant get by with my 9 to 5
And I cant provide the right type of life for my family
Cause man these goddam food stamps dont buy diapers
And its no movie theres no Mekhi Phifer this is my life
And these times are so hard and its getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama dramas screaming on and
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point Im like a snail
Ive got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option failures not
Mom I love you but this trailers got to go
I cannot grow old in Salems lot
So here I go is my shot
Feet fail me not cause maybe the only opportunity that I got

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that’s alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that’s alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie
I can’t tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now it’s a steel knife in my windpipe
I can’t breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it’s like I’m in flight
High off of love drunk from the hate
It’s like I’m huffin paint I love the more I suffer
Right before I’m bout to drown she resuscitates me
She fuckin hates me and I love it wait
We’re runnin right back here we go again
It’s so insane cause when its goin good its goin great
I’m superman with the wind at his back she’s lois lane
But when its bad its awful
I feel so ashamed I snap
“Who’s that dude” I don’t even know his name
I laid hands on her I’ll never stoop so low again
I guess I don’t know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that’s alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that’s alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever loved somebody so much
You can barely breathe when your wit em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling yea them chills used to get em
Now you’re getting fucking sick of lookin at em
You swore you’d never hit em never do nothing to hurt em
Now you’re in each others face spewin venom in your words when you spit em
You push pull each others hair scratch claw bit em
Throw em down pin em so lost in the moments when you’re in em
Its the rage thats the culprit controls you both
So they say its best to go our separate ways
Guess they don’t know you cause today
That was yesterday yesterday is over its a different day
Sound like broken records playin over
But you promised her next time you’d show restraint
You don’t get another chance life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that’s why they call it window panepain
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that’s alright cause I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that’s alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now I know we said things did things
And we fall back into the same patterns
But your temper is just as bad as mine is
You’re the same as me
But when it’s comes to love you’re just as blinded
Baby please come back it wasn’t you
Maybe our relationship isn’t as crazy as it seems
Maybe that’s what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I’ll know is that I love you too much to walk away tho
Come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don’t you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball
Next time I’m pissed ill aim a fist at the drywall
Next time there won’t be no next time
I apologize even though I know its lies
I’m tired of the games I just want her back
I know I’m a liar if she ever tries to fucking leave again
I’m a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that’s alright cause I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that’s alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie
I love the way you lieLyrics submitted by Nancy

And Im ready to DROP BOMBS
Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca Rebecca
Its the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
Its my sector homosexual disector come again rewind selecta
I said nice rectum I had a vasectomy Hector
So you cant get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lector and a guy sex and I bet ya
I tantlize you and in less than 5 seconds I get ya
They say once bitten and twice shy
Well Im next to the guy with nine ecstacy pills and 5 extra
Boxes of ripped condoms in quantities why yes sir
I took the rest of the lunesta pills from my dresser
Its my kinda vibe what else should I try Lester
Drop kicked the bitch before her second trimester
Performed a home abortion with dexter then I guess I
Dig a fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her
I guess its time for you to hate me again
Lets begin now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball youre all in
I said I guess its time for you to hate me again
Lets begin now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball youre in my medicine ball friends
All my westside bitches throw it up
Put a baloon inside your pussy queef and blow it up
Man I think that he just fell off the teet and show enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwin up
Man youve seen it all before youre all too familiar with it
Theres a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know youre with it girl dont front oh no you didnt
I wont rape all the pussycat dolls Nicole you kidding
I pee on Rihanna see man I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room crazy glueing Madonna to
The lazy boy sofa fold her in two then sit on her
Imagine the visual for that man who woulda thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeance
But the chicks so old she looks like she out lived a life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you werent so defensive it wouldnt be youre so sensitive
I guess its time for you to hate me again
Lets begin now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball youre all in
I said I guess its time for you to hate me again
Lets begin now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end
My medicine ball youre in my medicine ball friends
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand

Youll never fill my shoes my Superman costume

Everyday I hate you more and more throw down the cardboard
Lets breakdance if you think youre hardcore

I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey what daddy always tell you
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about
Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When Im gone but Im trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see youre sad even when you smile even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes deep inside you want to cry
Cuz youre scared I aint there
Daddys with you in your prayers
No more crying wipe them tears
Daddys here no more nightmares
We gon pull together through it we gon do it
Laney uncles crazy aint he
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
Were all we got in this world
When it spins when it swirls
When it whirls when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin puzzled in a daze
I know its confusing you
Daddys always on the move mammas always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy dont want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us
I dont see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But its just something we have no control over and thats what destiny is
But no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day well wake up and this will all just be a dream
Now hush little baby dont you cry
Everythings gonna be alright
Stiffen that upperlip up little lady i told ya
Daddys here to hold ya through the night
I know mommys not here right now and we dont know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
But i promise mommas gon be alright
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck em under the tree and said some of em were from me
Cuz daddy couldnt buy em
Ill never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Cuz daddy felt like a bum see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mommas heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And thats when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the TV and momma didnt like it
And you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin stone momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
Im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now Im sittin in this empty house just reminiscing
Lookin at your baby pictures it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown its almost like youre sisters now
Wow guess you pretty much are and daddys still here
Laney Im talkin to you too daddys still here
I like the sound of that yeah
Its got a ring to it dont it
Shh mommas only gone for the moment
And if you ask me too
Daddys gonna buy you a mockingbird
Imma give you the world
Imma buy a diamond ring for you
Imma sing for you
Ill do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird dont sing and that ring dont shine
Imma break that birdies neck
Id go back to the jewler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat dont fuck with dad hahaLyrics submitted by trayuka

we aint even have to say shit
dont ever make the first move
just let em come to you
cause they always gunna see and do what the other one do
so let em come to you
the rest of us follow suit
if they really want it bad enough well then they gunna come
now here they come as we expected now we just set em up
for me to raise such a stink up
when motherfuckers hate your guts
you aint even gotta say much
for me to put a pen to a blank sheet of papers
like smearing blood stains with a paint brush
i cant explain what it is my brain does
but however it works its insane
and it aint just my brain thas dangerous
its a whole combination of things
and im not affriad to raise the stakes up
i got a million bucks in the banks and 8 trucks
for anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
im patiently waiting for the day
to see the look on ya fake mugs
when you thugs go bankrupt
whatever you drank musta just turned ya into some gangstas
this is me talking motherfucker
you wanna pop shit wakeup then makeup
its too late chump now face up
i pray for the day that someone who spits with the calliber that nas and jay does
opens up his jaw to say something or rattle my name off
or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
so i can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw
and give him the surgery that he came for
till i pull the paint off
but i think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth
cause ive always came off
when they try to rush him and lost
and came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
the only thing i wait for
is day that i dont gotta report to probate court
cause ima give ya all the reason to hate more
cause ive been holding my tounge till i got a sprained jaw
alot of rappers on my list that just aint ja
and ima read that motherfucker off from april
you pussies think i went soft since 8 mile
when i come back ill be shootin more than just paint balls
dont ever make the first move
just let em come to you
cause they always gunna see and do what the other one do
so let em come to you
the rest of us follow suit
if they really want it bad enough well then they gunna come
now here they come as we expected now we just set em up
this shit is all day man its too easy
we playin chess you playin checkers
you bout to get ya motherfuckin asses jumped
we aint just talking to one person
we talking to everymotherfuckingbody who wants to bring it cause we bringin it to anybody who wants to bring it

Youre not afraid of the dark are ya
You hear the beat As it makes ya Not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakotas door Its locked so I go to creep
round the back with binoculars Not cause I want to peep
But because Im hungry She smells like tacos I want to eat
Visions of hot chocolatey marshmallows Also sweet
With sugar plums Oh look here comes Marshall hes on your street
Hes placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on em Hes dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey A holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast With strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers With Jon Benet Rams
I guess a modern day jack the ripper Is all that I am
Cause when the lights are off I see the girls asleep
But i can hear u my love you keep calling me
I want the world to know you mean the world to me
So when you call me to come I will answer
Cause when the lights are off I see the girls asleep
I hear my music box playing a song for me
So wont you whirl around and do a whirl for me
And want you be my private dancer
I almost look comatose Who wants to be sobered gross
I foam like a doberman mouth open I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes and I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size eyes are so bugged I know
I put on my mothers make up get naked and run around
Wavin the gun around I think Im down to a hundred pounds
Theres thunder I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out
The devils upset with his wife they must be sluggin it out
I must be buggin the fuck out but what the fuck about
Voices are leading me up to the attic I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest but what do I do its locked
I pick it and open it but its stuffed full of human parts
I dig til I find it I wind it up and the tune just starts
Its playing a song so beautiful and the room is dark
The moon is full I smell a funeral guess Ill loom in the park
Cause when the lights are off I see the girls asleep
But i can hear u my love you keep calling me
I want the world to know you mean the world to me
So when you call me to come I will answer
Cause when the lights are off I see the girls asleep
I hear my music box playing a song for me
So wont you whirl around and do a whirl for me
And want you be my private dancer
Im fixated on asphyxating and breakin this little chicks
Neck like a pixie stick
The sick Satan worshippin bitches get horsewhippins
Im in the back through the back door slip in
Through the crack leavin the corpse drippin
The mortition of love sent from above
Forced entry the more wenchy the more stingy I become
Been doin this for more than a quarter century Im just numb
Am I dreamin is it real Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up gotta roll me the ladder
Id had enough of the chatter climb up to the window look at her
And climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her
with the bat a matter of fact that will splatter her
But before I do that Ill have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments backtoback like Tabatha
Im your secret admirer Im back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight but youre no match for Dracula
Prolonging her plight as I go back to stabbin her
Dismember her limbs simple as that cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens then pan back the camera
Stand back cuz here comes your man Jack so Pamela
Cause when the lights are off I see the girls asleep
But i can hear u my love you keep calling me
I want the world to know you mean the world to me
So when you call me to come I will answer
Cause when the lights are off I see the girls asleep
I hear my music box playing a song for me
So wont you whirl around and do a whirl for me
And want you be my private dancerLyrics submitted by rebecca
