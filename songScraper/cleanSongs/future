The coolest dj in the world
I put spikes around my jacket
And Im strapped up with a ratchet
A nigga set my nigga up
The game is full of madness
Sometimes I wanna get inside that Escalade and crash it
My pain running deeper than the ocean it is
My pain running deeper than the ocean no tears
My pain running deeper than the ocean I can take it
Pain running deeper than the ocean
Im spiked up like a bad drink
I work hard and it came out
Then I went from dead broke
To laying up in a penthouse
I woke up the evening
And I seen a demon
Im on that rare codeine
Trying to clear my thoughts
Niggas wont feel my pain
All they see is fame
I should have went to Harvard
I put spikes around my jacket
And Im strapped up with a ratchet
A nigga set my nigga up
And game is full of madness
Sometimes I wanna get inside that Escalade and crash it
My pain running deeper than the ocean it is
My pain running deeper than the ocean no tears
My pain running deeper than the ocean I can take it
Pain running deeper than the ocean
Taking three drugs at one time
And you niggas start hating on future
I commit a million crimes
That aint enough for you
Ima say a million rhyme
All the shit Ive been through
Niggas try to hold me back
They didnt wanna see me with the plug
They didnt wanna see me with the sack
Niggers try to chase the paper
Then you got to take his life
Then they put a hit on your head
Then you walk around with a price
Million aint way what you see
Better go good on sight
I put spikes around my jacket
And Im strapped up with a ratchet
A nigga set my nigga up
And game is full of madness
Sometimes I wanna get inside that Escalade and crash it
My pain running deeper than the ocean it is
My pain running deeper than the ocean no tears
My pain running deeper than the ocean I can take it
Pain running deeper than the ocean Lyrics submitted by maceo

Go tell em its a homicide murder
Go tell em its a homicide murder murder
Go tell em its a homicide murder murder

Be so scared for ya life you call the police on ya
You ready say you ready
You gon starve or you want fetti Yo lifell change a second

Just so I can give you the good advice

And when you in the streets thats how it goes
When you in the kitchen cooking white
You go through hell to get to paradise

Just so I can give you the good advice

And I just slowed down on my pocketloss
And when you in the streets thats how it goes
When you in the kitchen cooking white
You go through hell to get to paradise
When you in the game playing file
I hit a lick for hundred eightythou
Blow it in 3 months Im going out of town
Get two bad bitches and hit greyhound
I had to cut the couch down
They tried to burn the cross down
They even tried to bring god down
We shootin for the stars now
We live above the ground
Go from town to town
They treat you like Diddy
With all these crimes shooter committed they must be winning
And we aint even finish I came from the highway
Right where the lighty city
I go through hell so walk with you
Im taking chances when I talk to you
Just so I can give you the good advice
We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on my pocketloss
And when you in the streets thats how it goes

Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time at the same damn time
At the same damn time at the same damn time
Im on Pluto Im on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa popping bottles at the same damn time
Gucci made in Italy Bally belt Im killing shit
The way I rock a jimmy Choos the word got out Im dealing it
I fuck her she a immigrant
Dont touch her she got benefits
Fucking up on Louie kicks thats the way Im kicking it
Puerto Rican Japanese we laid up at the Double Tree
Yellow ice a bumble bee pinky ring a quarter key
Iphone a metro twerking off the whole thing
My ear ring a jelly bean gangster lean and ireine
Red eyes no visine Im locd out on the bean
Horse shoes on my jeans robbing jeans with the wings
Yellow bone on the team trafficin that Yao Mings
Space boots with the spikes go to AZ on a flight
Mail a hundred over night Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I wear Gucci I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone cooking dope at the same damn time
Selling white selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time at the same damn time
At the same damn time at the same damn time
Im on Pluto Im on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa popping bottles at the same damn time
Im in Fifs with the sack going crazy
Got some diamonds around my neck no flugazy
Bad bitches in the suite trying to bathe me
Just a young hood nigga streets raised me
Working with a unit try and stretch it to another one
Drinking on that active and it taste just like some bubble gum
Thumbing through a check boarding on the jet
Talking on the iPhone sipping out the Styrofoam
That dirty got my mind gone that money got my mind blown
VVS and white stones VVS and white stones
Im rolling like a rolling stone
Free Bands on Al Capone
And my cash way long turned up
I see a bunch of clones
I wear Gucci I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone cooking dope at the same damn time
Selling white selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time at the same damn time
At the same damn time at the same damn time
Im in Pluto Im in Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa popping bottles at the same damn time
Give me an apartment and some water and I can swim
Got that gambino jumping out the gym
My young nigga serving jays outside crim
Jump across from me you know your chances slim
In my Aviator Gucci like Im driving planes
Flying cash in cash money smell like cocaine
Doing Birdman numbers making flips like Jackie Chan
Walk inside the jeweler drop a bail on ya rinng
Spent so much at Louie gave me free champagne
In Bel Harbor shopping and they doing the same thang
And I keep my cup with me like a pimp
I check a Magic Don Juan take a glimpse
Spike Lee need to get this shit on film
I wear Gucci I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone cooking dope at the same damn time
Selling white selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time at the same damn time
At the same damn time at the same damn time
Im on Pluto Im on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa popping bottles at the same damn time Lyrics submitted by Jason Young Williams
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Is that her in the VIPline
With the Vuitton and Yves saint Laurent
Used to drive the Nissan now she in a Beamer
I dont want er cause she from the corner
And I heard that Beamer was a loner
Her old man the owner
And I dont even drink Coronas
Were the type to drink tomorrow
On dirty Sprite forever
You can come sit with me
If youd like to change the weather
If you wanna live better
We can buy a crib wherever
Dont get too thirsty get used to this cheddar
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see er fore I do tell er I wish that Ive met er
Turn on the lights
Im lookin for er too
I heard she keep her promises and never turn on you
I heard she aint gone cheat and she gon never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need er she come through
Turn on the lights
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Turn on the lights
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Im lookin for er
Send er my way
Tell er Ive been lookin for er in the broad day
Hangin with the dope boys in the hallways
And I know to keep er man you gotta get that cake
Turn on the lights
Im lookin for er too
I heard she got a pretty face and stand up like a stallion
I heard that she a precious jewel you treat her to medallions
I wanna be the one to find out if I go to probly
And if I get the number you know I cant wait to dial it
And if we get together girl you know we gon be wylin
And when we get together we make magic and its ours
Whenever you up here aint nothin nobody can do about it
She a hood girl
But she a good girl
She will miss me
Now she ready for the world
I want your energy
To take control of me
Ive tried to go to sleep
And seen er in my dreams
Just in case I run across her today Im a stay clean
Just in case she recognize a face send er to me
And tell er Ive been lookin for er with a flashlight
You cant tell her nothin else because I got my cash right
And tell er if she honest and promise she stay true
Make sure when you tell er tell er we go out past the moonLyrics submitted by avonlea
