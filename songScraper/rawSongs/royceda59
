[Intro Sample]
When I woke up this morning
I found myself alone
I turned to touch her hair
And she was gone, she was gone
And there beside my pillow
Were her tears from the night before
She said give up your guns and face the law

I robbed a bank in Tampa
And I thought I had it made
But the hounds picked up my trail within the glades
So I ran
And I stumbled on this cabin
And she came to me to me once more
She said give up your guns
She said give up your guns
She said give up your guns
And face the law

[Royce Da 5'9"]
This is a stick up, stick up
Pistols will lift up, lift up
If you don't get up, get up
Your hands
Kwe tell 'em

[Talib Kweli]
Sucome to the violence
And we get numb and get silent
Get my gun into firing
I'm never runnin' or hidin'
[X2]

Verse One [Royce Da 5'9"]
About a hundred any minute bullets runnin' from the guns
In front of any one of y'all youngins
We ain't trippin in the winter
Still killin' spring chickens
We ain't slippin, we ain't sittin'
You ain't listen this is me
Bitch this Is Nickel bitch
I'm G
With my nigga Kweli
Get back gettin' stacks since 03'
No strings yo swing wack
Spittin' crack makin' tracks
Like a dope fiend oh
Me and my team hot
Dream team I done seen
Obscene fiends seein'
Nigga whole backdrop
Like a green screen stuck before its cream
So they stuck him up in Sing Sing
I know what you mean dog
I been caught between walls
I don't kill (I'm the boss)
I just make Scream calls
I don't aim I don't give a speech in the streets
Like I'm livin' in the movie
I just let the thing off
Hittin' up my funds while I'm rippin up the slums
With the only pistol left
Cause they givin up they
Guns

Chorus:
And now I'm in this cabin where my own true love should be
Instead there lies a note she wrote to me
And it said: though you can't live by the bullet
But you sure as dead can die
My love give up your guns or say goodbye
Goodbye
And the sheriff now is calling with a shotgun at my door
Son
Give up your guns
And face the law

[Royce Da 5'9"]
This is a stick up, stick up
Pistols will lift up, lift up
If you don't get up, get up
Your hands
Kwe tell 'em

[Talib Kweli]
Come to the violence
And we get numb to get silent
Get my gun into firing
I'm never runnin' or hidin'

[X2]

[Verse Two: Talib Kweli]
Hell naw my niggas don't make speeches
Cause we ain't no fake preachers
Or follow fake teachers
Soon as the state releases
You from the bank
You not a citizen
You quickly learn the difference
Between rights and privileges
Nothin' like Deliverence
Remember when Sai got shot?
Yo it was winter he layed on the ice shiverin'
Comfortably numb
He was killed for being hungry and young
Violently is how the company run
They dump in the slum
See the flashing lights and the gun
At the end of the tunnel no rebuttal to run
The blood is the sum of the equation
When you add up the factors
The splatters attractive
Life don't matter to rappers
So we glorify and glamorize
Talk about our plans to die
And learn to always stay inside the motherfuckin' camera's eye
Get my good side, murder is so sexy
But the hood cried every time one of us would die

[Verse Three: Raekwon]
Give up my guns never you crazy?
I'm all blazey
All 80 fly out
Put you right out lets try it out
Save the babies
Bressed to impress
Blow a hole in your vest
With suitcase money I roll up the stretch
High powered 9's Mausbergs
Squeeze faster than new V's
Fresh new bags of bullets or bean
Got my paper poppin' and plottin'
I blow a hole right through your stocking
Come out your back and scratch up your lockin'
We real killas and don dons
Pop through the vagabond tons
Boulevards where niggas will pull a card
Wrong songs don't play me lady killas
Baby guerrillas with hate feelings
That'll spray up the ceilings
The best ninjas in the business
Mind your business
Staten judicious
Malicious team we live in the kitchens
And dis niggas go the fuck home
Bring better biscuits
Come to the rally and flash if you with this

[Outro: Raekwon]
I'm not playin'. We shoot niggas. All day. Keep them hollows nigga. They got
New little guns. New little joints with long baby missiles in it. Them the
Joints we play with nigga. The Einsteins is on nigga. Hard bottoms in
The hoodie. Ice Water nigga. Word up. General Shala Raekwon. All day
E'day. A professional. Yeah. Get that money niggas. Don't never give up
Them guns. You stupid? ---Lyrics submitted by koalby owens.

[Eminem - Intro]
 Yeah, yeah
 I don’t know what else to say
 I can’t, I can’t think of nothin’
 I’m stumped
 Here we go (Here we go)

On your feet (On your feet)
 Stand up (Stand up)
 Everybody hands up (Hands up)
 Uh, man, I dunno, man
 Everytime I go to think of something played out to say
 You already said it

[Verse 1 - Royce da 5’9″]
 I ain’t calling names cause all of y’all the same, plus
 I’m the king, all my past pain all done changed up
 All these plains, all these lames, since the Slaughter’s came up
 Cause they know they hands tied, feet ball and chained up
 N-ggas be quick to call me the new 50 Cent
 Because of my relationship with Marshall
 Used to make me a little partial, but here’s the brain f-ck
 We the same cuz
 I’m probably about to fall out with a young buck
 While I attempt to f-ck the f-cking game up
 Bitch, splat, only thing I fear in here is chit-chat
 You are hearing bars like your ear against a Kit Kat
 Shady guys like the Navy, drive, wavy bye-bye
 Maybe my Glock can turn your top to baby’s Maybach
 My shit is powerful, literally sick, trust me n-gga
 It’s ugly to kill a thing if the bigger I get
 The more disgusting and f-ckin’ disfigured it gets
 N-ggas expect me to go pop, oh, stop
 Y’all about the champagne, I’m about the toast
 I, only f-ck with mailmen with heroin from Boca
 N-ggas that’ll smoke you while you staring in your postbox
 Only incense he enlightens when he’s thinkin’
 While that sinks in, I got a Brinks ink pen
 I’m back, muthaf-cker
 Notice the flyness on the cover of the XXL
 I’m back from the dead like Tobey Maguire from the Brothers
 How y’all realer? (How y’all realer?) If I said it, I did it
 If I didn’t, I seen it first-hand like a car dealer
 Give up the throne, your lease up, I am the Mona Lisa
 That decoded Da Vinci Code, you throwin’ your piece up
 Is a waste of fake like a phony B-cup
 N-gga, the mistake was like my only teacher
 Wait ’til they get a load of me ’cause

I’ve got Gucci’s on my feet
 Diamonds on my neck
 Diamonds on my wrist
 Bitches on my dick
 But y’all already said that

Choppers in the trunk
 Models in the front
 Bottles in the club
 But I don’t give a f-ck
 But y’all already said that

[Eminem]
 Cause sometimes I feel like it’s so hard
 For me to come up with shitty to say (Ayyyyyy)
 I’m at a loss for words ’cause y’all already said it all
 I think I’m runnin’ out of cliches
 I’m gettin’ writer’s block
 Psyche!

[Verse 2 - Royce da 5'9'']
 When I stand up in this booth, n-ggas notice it
 Sittin’ on the same boat that Noah built
 Floatin’ on the same water Moses split
 Poetry in motion, but we sittin’ on your grave site, overkill
 Aren’t you tired? Why are you so loud? Quiet!
 Real dudes move in silence like a mute drivin’ a new hybrid
 You dudes is too excited
 You a dude that’d try to sue a dude that’s suicidal
 You will just be another victim
 I am like a nickel of weed rolled in a doobie, I’m a little twisted
 I roll like the end credits in movies, y’all just got scripted
 Got y’all n-ggas’ bitches bobbin’ to this one when she witcha
 When she wit’ me, she bobbin’, not vibin’
 Tryna put her mind into the inside of my zipper
 I’m a sperate with a purpose, havin’ problems?
 Not a problem I’ve encountered
 I have found elephants, lions, clowns
 Will jump through hoops like they workin’ for the circus
 At the fire round the circle’s right in front of them, fire rounds
 Pun intended, gun extended, what are you mark’s askin’?
 Car’s Aston, started as a hard-top and I saw past it
 Since I decided to start Class diss
 All black, all glass, panoramic roof been gettin’ marked absent
 I authorize my own all-access
 Your bitch a whore, I’m a catch, she ball-catchin’
 Her jaw’s been broadcasted all across the globe from the store to Japan
 Her p-ssy need to blocked and reported as spam
 Bong! Interscope up in this dope and I sell it
 My voicemail is full, got bitches screamin’ inside of envelopes
 And they tryna mail ‘em to me, tryna reach my phone
 I don’t know which one is harder
 Tryna not to take your bitch or tryna get rid of my own

[Hook]
 I got Gucci’s on my feet
 Diamonds on my neck
 Diamonds on my wrist
 Bitches on my dick
 But y’all already said that

Choppers in the trunk
 Models in the front
 Bottles in the club
 But I don’t give a fuck
 But y’all already said that

[Eminem]
 Cause sometimes I feel like it’s so hard
 For me to come up with shitty to say (Ayyyyyy)
 I’m at a loss for words ’cause y’all already said it all
 I think I’m runnin’ out of cliches
 I’m gettin’ writer’s block
 Psyche!

Man, get the bozac
 We need to start bringin’ that shit back (Mad flava)
 Man, f-ck it, I’m ’bout to catch some wreck (We in effect, money!)
 Mad props to Royce for keepin’ it real
 On the strength, no diggity
 I’m ’bout to go pull some hoes, get my mack on

Haters get the gasface!
