What if the sky was turning red
I know we'll be safe
Right here in my bed
Layin' face to face
Ooh, girl I love the way you sound
When you rain on me
So tonight let's act it out
Show you how it's gonna be

I'm gonna kiss your other set of lips
Hold yo body by yo legs and hips
The world can't end until the finish
Cause we gonna

We gonna do it's bout to be the end of the world
And they dependent on us
To make earth shake in love
As we lay down
Lay down down 

Tellin' to go harder (Go harder)
Ya tellin' me to go deeper (Go deeper)
I feel yo knees gettin' weaker and weaker (We can go longer if you try to lay down) Lay down down

All these vibrations from ya legs
Massaged my back
I got ya body shiverin'
Cause we covered in sweat
And girl I like the way it opens up
When you throw it back, baby
Girl, it might be too much, ohh
Baby, if you keep doin' that

I got that pillow for your knees right here
Baby, can you make it disappear
Your voice is the last thing your gonna hear
Then I wanna make you holla

We gonna do it like it's bout to be the end of the world
And they dependent on us
(To make) the earth shake of love
(And we) Lay down
Lay down (Tellin' to go harder)
Go harder
You tellin' me to go deeper (Go deeper)
I feel yo knees gettin' weaker and weaker
As we lay down
Lay down down

Do it like we only got one (Got one)
Baby, let's pretend we only got one (Night)
One last time
Let me take my time
Do it to you right
Buildin' them bridges may be fallin' down
But that won't stop me
From turnin' that thing around
Girl, yea
Won't ya on come over

And we can treat it like it's the mother fuckin'
End of the world
dependent on us
To make the earth shake in love
As we lay down 
Lay down down
Tellin' me to go harder (Go harder)
(A nigga goin' harder in the paint) Tellin' me to go deeper (go deeper)
(So deep you can feel my submarine) I feel yo knees gettin' weaker and weaker
Lay down
Lay down down---Lyrics submitted by Clayvonte Abner.

Your body's an isosceles
And I'm just tryna try angles
Your love is trigonometry
Just tryna solve the whole equation

What's it about you (about you)
I wanna love you
Picking you up, picking you up
So I can touch you
Should we do that? Can I do that? (baby)
Answers are usually in the back

Substitution, add me in
Multiply my love
Is that too much?

Add me in

Baby just add me, baby just add me in

Divide your legs and count to 3 (3, 2, 1, come on)
He's just not the answer baby
And that's just my hypothesis

How did you get so young
I heard you were born today
Heard that you came and found
The sky and i just wanna say
Welcome the world is glad youre here to stay
Have fun is time to give another day

: 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
If I have a moment 
I'd capture that moment 
You would be right here next to me 
If I had the secret 
The secret to your love 
I would plant your treasure beneath my heart 
Lock it all up 
Throw away the key 
I would never give it up 
Cause I was just a fool 
A fool for you 
And I loved you so childishly 

Chorus: 
And I want it all back 
I want it all 
I want it all 
Girl I want it all back
I want it all back
I want it all 
I want it all 
Girl I want it all 
You never miss a good thing til its gone 
I want it all now, I want it all back 

If there is a green light 
And its bout to turn yellow 
Pedal to the floor cause I know your heart is turning red 
If I had the minutes I would turn them into hours
And make love to your mind and not your body instead 
I was just a fool 
A fool for you
That didn't know what I had until I lost you 
Every single moment that you're not here 
Its evident to me that everything just seems all clear 

(Chorus)

Bridge:
Now everything isn't everything 
If everything, everything isn't with you 
And I want it all back 
I want it all 
I want it all 
Girl I want it all back 
I want it all back 
I want it all 
I want it all 
Girl I want it all 
You never miss a good thing till its gone 
I want it all, now I want it all back 
Now I want it all back, now I want it all back 
Now I want it all back---Lyrics submitted by Mateo.

Cause I'mma love you anyway
Cause I'mma love you anyway

I know you probably never had somebody
Loving you like I do, someone that's there for you
Don't judge ya cause I know we only human
I must be stupid babe, letting you slip away

If you show me all your flaws, I'll show you mine
I'll claim your baggage, no longer need to hide

Cause I'mma love you anyway
Cause I'mma love you anyway
Cause I'mma love you anyway
Cause I'mma love you anyway

I wish that you could see you like I see you
It's like that you're no good, you're just misunderstood
Now it's my job to make you a believer
Them boys ain't like this man, can't love you like I can

If you show me all your flaws, I'll show you mine
I'll claim your baggage, no longer need to hide

Cause I'mma love you anyway
Cause I'mma love you anyway

You don’t even call anymore
It’s so different from the way it was before
Everyday I’d hear your pretty voice
I’ve had no choice but to be all alone without you

There are so many mistakes we make in love
Cuz still I’m think this is something we can solve
I’ll take all the blame for breaking your heart
But you can’t let it tear us apart because

(Chorus)
She didn’t mean anything to me (nothing)
She wasn’t the one I see in my dreams (ohh nooo)
And you know it aint true, if you believe (yeaa)
Please accept my apology (please accept my apology baby)
I didn’t mean to hurt you girl

I didn’t see myself settling down
But I knew from the first time you came around
From the moment I looked into your eyes
I’d never wanted to see you cry over me

But I knew if we got serious in love
We would never ever wanna break it up
I wasn’t ready for until this day
Could you believe when I say that she

(chorus)
She didn’t mean anything to me (no she didn’t)
She wasn’t the one I see in my dreams (no she was not)
And you know it aint true (yea),if you believe
Please accept my apology (baby I didn’t mean)
I didn't mean to hurt you girl

She didn't mean anything to me (nooo)
She wasn't the one I see in my dreams
Girl you know it aint true,if you believe
Please accept my apology (whoaa)
I didnt mean to hurt you girl---Lyrics submitted by Jaedon.

(feat. Kendrick Lamar)

If you leave this time I fear that you'll be gone for good
So I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and
He said he'll be back with that same
Tone that you just said you'll stay forever with

It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
It's safe to say you're the only reason for it

I've been bleeding in your silence
I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves and fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God
He must be mad with me, it's coming
I'm confused to who'll I'll spend my forever with

It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
It's safe to say you're the only reason for it

So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it
And I poke and I poke and I poked at it
But it stayed stagnant then I poked at it some more, some more
And in my notepad, man I wrote and I wrote
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it
If it don't chip then a toe tag is, one last
I'm a hope, I'm a hope so the iceberg don't float
If I do manage to do damage to you dammit
It'd be grandest, ten grammies or my granite still standing
With a note, a note that read "granted, don't you panic"
When you make mistakes the most, the most
One day it'll make you grow, you grow
When you outlandish and you lose manners
To God you shall consult, consult
When the bright cameras are still cramming
In your face and it provoke, provoke
You to act manic, just stay planted
Cause you reapin' what you sowed
Keep positivity in your heart and
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just know, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you re-new your vision
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, what the fuck would you do to a critic, my nigga?
Yeah, yeah, tell me, when doves cry do you hear 'em love?
Do you hear 'em love? Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live even when we mustard the gift
When it gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me
Don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord

It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
I feel like you're the only reason for it
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
It's safe to say you're the only reason for it---

I know it's late, I know it's late
And baby I can't focus, focus
I just flew in to town today
I'm hoping that you notice, did you notice?
I just posted my landing, oh
Wondering if the same old understanding, stands

I know you got work pretty early, I'll be around 'bout 3:30
Usually you done by one, so baby when I wake you up

Just let me rock, fuck you back to sleep girl
Don't say a word no, don't you talk
Just hold on tight to me girl
Fuck you back to sleep girl rock you back

Now where you at? Just dropped my bags
I'm coming through to meet ya, oh yeah, to meet ya oh
I know you're almost half asleep but you know I might need ya
Girl I need ya, oh
Gon' gimme that spare key, oh
But if you keep the door unlocked, be ready, oh

I know you got work pretty early, I'll be around by 3:30
Usually you're done one, so baby when I wake you up

Don't say a word no, girl don't you talk

Just a few hours ago
We had the TV on (drowning out your screams)

I'ma make you beg for it, beg for it
Go on and whisper your wishes to me, beg...

Not gonna lie to you, wasn't expecting you to (have me on my knees, yea..)
I'm gonna make you cry, tears from your paradise..
And, love your ass to sleep, yea..

You got my favorite, secrets on

Girl what you sayin, speak your mind
Tell me what you like...

I'ma make you beg for it, beg for it
I'll give you what you need, only if you say please
I'ma make you beg for it, beg for it
Go on and whisper your wishes to me, beg...

Baby I'ma make you scream yea..

Twenty more seconds (ohh..)

Some people have to learn
some people wait there turn
some people have to fight
some people give it up

[Chipmunk - Verse 1]
They wanna hold you back, tell ‘em pee off
whenever they say you can’t, take the T off
I remember when they told me I couldn’t be famous
now my dream and reality is simultaneous
and work your own way to the top
if they put you on a pedestal they can take you off
and there’s a higher level than the top
you gotta make more, don’t do with what you got
yeah, so get it in go sunny
not everybody gets a second chance at getting money
or even getting lucky so you gotta feel
the hunger in your tummy

[Chris Brown]
I’m always pushing myself to the limit
making sure I stay ahead
you made me who I am, from the words you said

Some people have to learn
some people wait there turn
some people but not me
I was born a champion

some people have to fight
some people give their lives
some people don’t believe
I was born a champion
but I was born a champion
but I was born a champion

[Chris Brown - Verse 2]
This gon be the realest shit I ever wrote
off the record, no camera’s, forget a quote
some of my family doing good, most doing dope
I from Virginia where they hang the n-ggas by rope
I used to see my momma getting beat down!
Is that the real definition of me now?
I fell off, back on my feet now
headed to the sky, can’t even see down
award shows, I poured my heart out
and people still steady trynna point my flaws out
and I’d be lying if I said it ain’t get to me
but I’m a champion, legend, history

[Chorus]

[Chipmunk - Verse 3]
Imagine you was the one, that couldn’t get a look in
couldn’t get a booking
couldn’t get a push in when you needed a shove
or your buttons they be pushing
so now they tryna shush him
it’s only you believing in you
they turn you into a bastard than moment you rude
attitude a little out of tune
but thats how champions move
yeah so go and get it in sunny
not everybody gets a second chance at getting money
or even getting lucky
so you gotta feel the hunger in your tummy

[Chorus]

[Chipmunk - Verse 4]
No-one wants to help
I guess you’re on your own
build a foundation with the bricks they throw
in a black and white World, True colours show
change if you want,e verybody grows
life’s like an ill, but try and get a hold
opinions aint fact, take em and let em go

[Chris Brown]
You made me who I am from the words you said

Some people have to learn
some people wait there turn
some people but not me
I was born a champion (champion)

some people have to fight
some people give their lives
some people don’t believe
but I was born a champion

Some people have to learn
some people wait there turn
some people but not me
I was born a champion (champion)

Some people have to learn
some people wait there turn
some people but not me
I was born a champion
but I was born a champion---Lyrics submitted by Chloe.

Daily I’ve been waiting, for the time to pass and let it fade in,
but baby my patience, it’s driving me crazy making me fall apart,

What you do, when the truth is ain’t quit enough
They lookin at you, telling you,
we need to break it up,
You need to do what you do, cause you need love.

[Chorus]
But imma make it up to you and show the world,
im a changed man.
cause you mean that much to me,
I dont wanna be done.
I doin all that I can and everybody hates Chris,
they can never understand.

Can we love (x5)
Can we love again.

Girl I know I told you, baby this ain’t over,
this ain’t over,
it ain’t over.

I remember ya touch, God, I miss you so much.
Please believe me, baby Im sorry.
And all of this money im thinking can never amount to every morning when I see your face

What you do, when the truth is ain’t quit enough
They lookin at you, telling you,
we need to break it up.
You need to do what you do,
cause you need love.

[Chorus]

Girl I know I told you, baby this aint over,
this aint over,
It aint over.

Saying sorry doesn’t make it all right, ( I know, I know)
I believe it we can make it, if we try, if we try!

Imma a changed man,
Cause you mean that much to me,
I dont wanna be done.
I doin that all again, everybody hates Chris,
they can never understand.

Can we love,
Can we love,
Can we love,
Can we love
Can we love,
Can we love,
Can we love again

Girl I know I told you, baby this aint over,
this aint over,
It aint over.---Lyrics submitted by monica.

All that bullshit's for the birds
You aint nothin but a vulture
Always hopin for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You’ll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free
Ohohohohohohohoh… x2(Chuckin up them(deuces)
I told you that im leaving (deuces)
I know you mad but so what?
I wish you best of luck
And now im finna throw them deuces up

[Chorus]
Im on some new shit
Im chuckin my deuces up to her
Im moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her [x2]

[Tyga Verse]
Uh, Use to be valentines
Together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
Its like I sent my love with a text two times
Call cause I care but I aint get no reply
Tryna see eye to eye but its like we both blind
Fuck it lets hit the club, i rarely sip but pour me some
Cause when its all said and done,
I aint gon be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love Im tired of tryin
My heart big but it beat quiet
I don’t never feel like we vibin
Cause every time we alone its a awkward silence
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit is over, whatchu trippin for?
I don’t wanna have to let you go
But baby I think its better if I let you know

[Chorus]
Im on some new shit

[K Mc verse]
Look, my shorty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we aint got no future in tomorrow
I’m a dick, so it shouldn’t be that hard to swallow
The other chick Im with never complain
She make wanna leave the one im with Usher Raymond
Probably didn’t register, don’t trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she aint you
She paula patton thick She give me déjà vu
And all that attitude, I don’t care bout it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon hear bout it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But im just puttin two up, chuckin up the deuce now

[Chorus]
Im on some new shit
Im chuckin my deuces up to her
Im moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye, say bye bye, say bye bye to her [x2]---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.

Everybody sees it's you
I'm the one that lost the view
Everybody says we're through
I hope you havn't said it too

So where do we go from here
With all this fear in our eyes
And where can love take us now
And we've been so far down
We can still touch the sky

If we crawl 
'till we can walk again
And we'll run
Until we're strong enough to jump
And we'll fly
Until there is no end
So let's crawl...crawl....crawl
Back to love
Yeah
Back to love
Yeah

Why did I change the pace
Hearts were never meant to race
Always felt the need for space
And now I can't reach your face

So where are you standing now
Are you in the crowd of my folks/voice?
Love can't you see my hand
Lend me one more chance
We can still have it all

So we'll crawl
till we can walk again
And we'll run
until we're strong enough to jump
then we'll fly
until there is no end
so let's crawl....crawl....crawl
back to love
yeah
back to love
yeah

Everybody sees it's you
Well I never wanna lose that view

So we'll crawl
Till we can walk again
Then we'll run
Until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly
Until there is no end
So let's crawl....crawl...(crawl)

So we'll crawl
Till we can walk again
Then we'll run
Until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly
Until there is no end
So let's crawl....crawl...(crawl)

Back to love....---Lyrics submitted by tiana mitchell.

(feat. Brandy)

I don't know why I even try
'Cause you don't want this no more
I would rather leave before I hurt you
And I would have died long ago if I didn't have my faith
I see you're starting to hate me
I see it in your face

My home don't feel like home
Just like my heart, it's empty
Changed the number on your phone
So when I call, you ain't gotta listen

And all your girls think that I ain't shit
And they the same ones lost in the club
Them bitches is basic
Now I'm number one that's lost in love
Girl, I can't take it
I'm on my knees
You're gonna see a grown man cry
I won't lie

I'm starting to hate me
A little more and more each day
I don't know me
It's like I can't get out of my own way
And you don't love me, you don't love me
If I knew better, I would do better

Looking at the names on your list and I can't find me
I'm deep underwater, are you gon' let me drown?
I see you're happy now
You're the life of the party, acting out
Ain't seen you in months, you ain't call me once

And all your boys say that I ain't shit
And they the same ones lost in the club
Them niggas is basic
And I'm the one who lost in love
And I can't take it
I'm on my knees
Don't you hate to see me cry?
I won't lie

I'm starting to hate me
A little more and more each day
I don't know me
It's like I can't get out of my own way
And you don't love me, you don't love me
If I knew better, I would do better

Thinking 'bout you and I, thinking 'bout you and I
My heart's beating in slow motion knowing that it's a lie
Thoughts got me thinking 'bout suicide
Baby, this is do or die
When you told me it's over
Ain't no point in being sober
All I wanna do is fade away
I hope that God for forgive me
'Cause I know you ain't gon' miss me
Baby girl, I won't try to say my goodbyes
You ain't gotta shed a tear for me
Baby girl, don't cry

I'm starting to hate me
A little more and more each day
I don't know me
It's like I can't get out of my own way
And you don't love me, you don't love me
If I knew better, I would do better (I would do better, I would do better)

I would do better
I would do better
I would do better
I would do better
I would do better
I would do better
I would do better ---

I dug a single seed into the ground
I hope it grows, grows
In a year or two if you're around
You'll see a rose, rose
Pack me up and keep me hidden somewhere, that you can find me
On a train to Paris going nowhere, trouble is behind me

Don't be gone too long (too long)
Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone
Don't be gone too long (too long)
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone

Golden leaves are dancing on the ground
It's getting cold, cold
Safe from time, will be forever young
Never old, old
See a ball of fire out in space, zooming up behind me
All the wonder written in your face
Was there beside me

Don't be gone too long (too long)
Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone
Don't be gone too long (too long)
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone

Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it really over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me (baby don't worry)
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it really over?

Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it really over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me (baby don't worry)
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it really over?

Don't be gone too long (too long)
Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone
Don't be gone too long (too long)
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone 

Don't be gone too long (too long)
Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone
Don't be gone too long (too long)
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone ---

[Verse 1:]
I don't wanna go there
We should never go there
Why you wanna go there
I guess I gotta go there

[Pre-Hook:]
You're hearing rumours about me
And you can't stomach the thought
Of someone touching my body
When you so close to my heart
I won't deny what they saying
Because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you

[Hook:]
So please babe
So please don't judge me
And I won't judge you
Cause it could get ugly
Before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me
And I won't judge you
And if you love me
Then let it be beautiful
Let it be beautifu-u-ul, let it be beautiful
Let it be beautifu-u-ul, let it be beautiful

[Verse 2:]
Everything I say right now
Is gonna be use in another fight
And I've been through this so many times
Can we change the subject
You gonna start asking me questions like:
"Was she attractive? Was she an actress?"
Baby the fact is

[Pre-Hook:]
You're hearing rumours about me
And saw some pictures online
Saying things, got you so angry
Making you wish you were mine
Before we start talking crazy
Saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset

[Hook:]
So please babe
So please don't judge me
And I won't judge you
Cause it could get ugly
Before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me
And I won't judge you
And if you love me
Then let it be beautiful

[Bridge:]
Just left the past
Just be the past
And focused on things
That are gonna make us laugh
Take me as I am, love who I was
I'll promise I'll be, the one that you can trust

[Hook:]
So please babe
So please don't judge me
And I won't judge you
Cause it could get ugly
Before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me
And I won't judge you
And if you love me
Then let it be beautiful
Let it be beautiful [x4]
Let it be beautiful ay
Let it be beautiful yeah [x3]

[Outro:]
I don't wanna go there baby yeah
We should never go there ---

Thank you for the autographs
And the tears over the years
You still found me, you didn't doubt me
I think you want some more
I do more than sing
I'm older now
Actin' now
Cause I got my own movie now
After all the awards
That they gave me
You still found me
You didn't play me, you didn't doubt me
Think you want some more
I truly believe that if it wasn't all for you
I don't know what I would do

I don't think they know the truth
Say they saw
I don't think they know, how could they know
I don't think they know the truth
Say they saw
I don't think they know, how could they know

Don't listen to (How could they know)
What people say (How could they know)
They don't know (How could they know)
'Bout you and me (How could they know)---

Dearly beloved, if this love only exists in my dreams...
Don't wake me up

Too much light in this window, don't wake me up
Only coffee no sugar, inside my cup
If I wake and you're here still, give me a kiss
I wasn't finished dreaming, about your lips

Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me...

Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me...

So much life in the city, you won't believe
Been awake for some days now, no time to sleep
If your heart is a pillow, this love's the bed
Tell me what is the music, inside my head

Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up up, up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me...

Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me...

I don't wanna fall, fall, fall, fall asleep no,
I don't wanna fall unless I'm falling for you

I don't wanna fall, fall, fall, fall asleep no,
I don't wanna fall unless I'm falling for you

Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up
Don't wake me up
Don't wake me...---

It don't get no better
My tongue writing you letters
Feeling you get wetter
We'll be making love until the morning after
And I can feel your tide slowly rising
As I'm sipping from your water fountain
We gon' flood the bed, take it to the ground
While I'm in your ocean baby, hold my head down

I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Yeah, baby)
Drown in it, drown in it (Just take me under)
Drown in it, drown in it (Under your waters, girl)
Drown in it, drown in it
I won't ever come up, oh

High heels and your red lips
It's Fahrenheit in here
And I can see a million ways
For me to surfboard between your waves
Baby going up down, all around
Drip drop, don't stop
No umbrella
Playing in your brain, shut it off
Splashing in your deep end
Hydrate me
Oh baby, come sit down right on my face

I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Yeah, baby)
Drown in it, drown in it (Just take me under)
Drown in it, drown in it (Under your waters, girl)
Drown in it, drown in it
I won't ever come up, oh

Baby, baby, baby
(Yeah I wanna drown in it)
Baby, baby, baby
(Yeah, I wanna drown in it)
Take me under, babe
(Yeah, I wanna drown in it)
I just wanna tell you

No price compares to what it's worth and
Your pool is like heaven on Earth
You screaming while I'm touching your spot
Oh girl, I got your water so hot
And I wanna drown in it
I wanna drown in it, babe
I wanna drown in it, baby
All you gotta do is -
Keep filling me up with your juices
Keep it right there baby, don't lose it

I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Yeah, baby)
Drown in it, drown in it (Girl, just take me under)
I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Under your waters, girl)
Drown in it, drown in it (Swim in your deep, babe)
I wanna drown in it, drown in it (All up in your creek, baby)
Drown in it, drown in it (And I'm not comin' up)
I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Gonna stay right there, baby)
Drown in it, drown in it (Gonna live in there, baby)
I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Right there under your water baby)
Drown in it, drown in it (Just like a male mermaid, babe)
I wanna drown in it, drown in it (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Drown in it, drown in it (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
I won't ever come up, oh

I stay thirsty, babe
Yeah ---

Said I'm all up in my feelings
Cover them on the shot
Got me feeling some type of wave
Told you I hate you, I don't mean it
And the only thing that I got
It's the pain that you've been feeling
Faded, faded, faded
All because of you

In my current situation
Try not to think of you
Not to break the rules
Why it always happens
When I give up this quest
Just can't stop myself
So I beg you tonight

I'm blowing up your line
I got you on my mind
And the truth is hard to fight

So I'll be
I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting
Drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you, yeah baby
I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting
Drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you

Drunk texting you
Drunk texting you
Drunk texting you
Drunk texting you

Looking at my phone thinking
Am I gonna hit send or not?
It's gonna be one the mornings
When I wake up and regret it
If I ain't get no reply
I don't wanna make it out of you
So I'm faded, faded, faded
Often drinking too
And you know how it goes
This is ain't nothing new
Why it always happens when I give up this quest
No, I just can't stop myself
So baby tonight

I'm blowing up your line
I got you on my mind
And the truth is hard to fight

So I'll be
I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting
Drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you, yeah baby
I'll be drunk texting, drunk texting
Drunk texting you
Drunk texting, drunk texting you

Drunk texting you
Drunk texting you
Drunk texting you
Drunk texting you

Intoxicated
Intoxicated

This one I think of you the most
Right after the towel anything goes
When I put my proud aside
I be doing the most, doing the most
I just spent 1, 2, 3 am thinking about you
Don't wanna be without you
Cause I'm on that liquid cause I hope this sh*t is worth it
Cause if it ain't it's all bad, all bad

Fallen Angel
Chris Brown

If I could take a trip, to outer space
She would be the one, I will see
When I get, to heavens gate
She would welcome me with her arms open wide, and a smile
Will shadow me brighter than the sun
She hasn't had a fair chance so I'll give her one
Let me tell you who she is, yeah

* (she's a fallen angel)
Sent from heaven up above
* (she's a fallen angel)
Waiten for me to love her, yeah
* (know that she is a fallen angel)
Take your judgment off her
* (i know, that she's a fallen angel)

You know, I could help her mend, her broken wings
So she can fly again
But I don't want to lose everything that i've gained
It's turnin me a selfish man, oh
Cause without my heart, just don't go
No more, no more

I couldn't take the pain from watchin her fly away
So say that you'll stay
She's mine


* (she's a fallen angel)
Sent fron heaven up above
* (she's a fallen angel)
Waiten for me to love her, yeah
* (she's a fallen angel)
So take your judgment off her
* (i know, that she's a fallen angel)
Don't you
Baby don't you, don't you worry, worry
I'm goin help you
Yo mama, don't you worry you goin reach the sky

* (she's a fallen angel)
Sent from heaven up above
Just for me
* (she's a fallen angel)
Waiten for me to wrap my heart around her
* (she's a fallen angel)
Makin due with all the judment, no
* (she's a fallen angel)
ooh ahh

[says]
Baby I know, I know that they done hurt you
But I'm here let's just take it all away 
So if you let me
You know what, just put your heart in my hands and everything they say
I take it back
Like this...

[goes back to singing]
You don't mean nothing
I don't want ya
I don't need ya
Never loved ya
You're nobody
And you'll never make it
You're a mistake, ooh---Lyrics submitted by Amie.

[Verse 1]

'Ye would've said you're "So Amazing"
So how could you be so "Heartless", girl?
Live your life, take T-I-M-E
"Day N' Nite' just like Kid Cudi
You think of me you will.

Drake would say that you're the "Best He Ever Had"
Rumors come and go but  you keep your shadow
Everywhere you go it follows
Can't understand, I still love you

[Chorus 1]

Since I thought I found the right woman
There were other guys who thought the same thing about her
Like damn you let me down, down, down
'Cuz you're famous girl for breakin' hearts
You're famous girl, girl, girl (x3)
Should've know you'd break my heart, heart, heart

[Verse 2]
Keri would've said my love "Knocked Her Down"
Keyshia would've told me I was "Sent From Heaven"
Sorry B' I don't wear no "Halo"
You were first to play the game though
Sorry I "Bust The Windows Out Your Car"

I might've cheated in the beginning
I was wrong for writing "Disturbia"
but I meant it in "Forever"
We were supposed to be together
And I can't let you go

[Chrous 2]

Since you thought you found the right man
There were other girls who thought the same thing about me
Like damn I let you down, down, down
'Cuz I'm famous girl for breakin' hearts
I'm famous girl, girl, girl (x3)
Didn't know I'd break your heart, heart, heart
I'm famous girl, girl, girl (x3)
Didn't know I'd break your heart, heart, heart

[Bridge]

Many hearts we should've left unbroken
Empty words are better left unspoken
Too much pressure I wish time was frozen
Since we lost our way now
I hope you're happy being famous

You're famous girl, girl, girl (x3)
Should've known you'd break my heart, heart, heart
I'm famous girl, girl, girl (x3)
Didn't know I'd break your heart, heart, heart---Lyrics submitted by camille.

She doesn't call before midnight, if at all
Oh, she never stays to watch the night turn to day

But I'm like use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine in the broad daylight
But you just use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine but

She only loves me when the lights are off, lights are off
She only loves me when the sun is down, sun is down
She only loves me when no one's around, one's around
She only loves me cause I put it down
And it's fine by me
And it's fine by me

She's like the wind, she comes and goes and again
All of my friends think I'm a fool, silly them

But I'm like use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine in the broad daylight
But you just use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine but

She only loves me when the lights are off, lights are off
She only loves me when the sun is down, sun is down
She only loves me when no one's around, one's around
She only loves me cause I put it down
And it's fine by me
And it's fine by me

She knows I can take her there, afterwards she just don't care
She knows I can take her there, afterwards she just don't care

She only loves me when the lights are off, lights are off
She only loves me when the sun is down, sun is down
She only loves me when no one's around, one's around
She only loves me cause I put it down
You a freak, and it's fine by me
You a freak, and it's fine by me
And it's fine by me
And it's fine by me
And it's fine by me---

Baby, does he do it for you? 
When he’s finished, does he step back and adore you? 
I just gotta know 'cause your time is money and I won’t let him waste it 
Oh no no 

Baby, just go with it 
'Cause when you're with me I can’t explain it 
It’s just different 
We can take it slow or act like you're my girl, let’s skip the basics, whoa, no. 

He’s so replaceable 
You're worth the chase you're putting on 

It’s alright, 
I'm not dangerous 
When you're mine, 
I'll be generous 
You're irreplaceable 
A collectible 
Just like fine China 

Favorite. You're my favorite. 
It’s like all the girls around me don’t have faces. 
And the saying goes 
"Life is just a game" but I'm not playin', whoa. 

He’s so replaceable 
You're worth the chase, you're puttin' up. 

It’s alright, 
I'm not dangerous

It’s alright, 
I'm not dangerous 
When you're mine, 
I'll be generous 
You're irreplaceable 
A collectible 
Just like fine China 

Took me awhile to find your love 
Ain't no amount of time in this world 
Save me a lot of time and just love me 
Feel it, baby, feel it in your soul 
Are you ready? 
I know your heart's been telling you you belong to me, ah nah nah no. 

It's alright, 
I'm not dangerous 
When you're mine, 
I'll be generous 
You're irreplaceable 
A collectible,

Where all my sunny days gone
is there any place to stay warm
It's not easy when your gone
tell me how in suppose to go on

With the rain,comes more pain
You never know (damn the weather)
Hard to hide,when I cry 
this pain inside (ain't getting better)
Baby shakes I feel so numb (nuuumb)
I m shivering,why did you go

My body is froze,every part of me cold
My hearts a chin,and I cant breathe
Souls breaking minus 31 degrees
Nowhere else to go...froze...

My heart struggles to beat yeah
I need a life line 
and I would rather die before I ...
start to freeze yeah
Live my life in fear,no way...

With the rain,comes more pain
You never know (damn the weather)
Hard to hide,when I cry

Baby shakes I feel so numb (nuuumb)

My body is froze,every part of me cold
My hearts achin,and I cant breathe
Souls breaking minus 31 degreese 
Nowhere else to go...froze...

I'am so cold,my body's frozen 
I'am so cold....frozen 

Froze +6 (my body is froze)

They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder,
well I bet I couldn't look more bolder, hold her, as we dip into my solar,
Call me Ford, baby I explore her.
It's navigator you're the one like Lincoln,
black Bentley, you'll look better in a pink one,
she's smoking and I about steam one, let's get....and make love on Venus,
Baby the ball is in your court like Serena's,
Make me jump over that net between us,
and let nothing get between us,
we're too hot
only sweat between us

Girl you're hot like fire

Coldest thing movin'

Heat up like summer

I see you writing on my wall , why you wanna do that (do that)
my names tagged you already see that (see that ). the media wants to paint it all black and they do it right in my face.
See I can’t sit back and let it all wash away I worked to hard for it to be erased.
before you talk Imma finish what I gotta say

Chorus:
cause i allready put in time with all of my grind 
and all of my grinding grinding 
you know I grind
trough all of this struggle
all of this struggle
even through the pain I still wanted to hustle

Man I had to feed my family and that’s just sayin.
and that’s just sayin damn keep my sanity.
Man I cant let you do it

Graffiti you tryna spray. Spray on me
Graffiti you tryna spray. Spray on me
Graffiti you tryna spray. Spray on me
All the graffiti you try to spray on my name

but its already writin on the wall cant cover it up
but its already writin on the wall cant cover it up

Who got award shows rocking every time I hit the stage
Even the haters went and bought a CD
Without  my fans I’m an empty spray can.
and I just cant paint a thing.

seems like the less I have the money the less I have the problems.
the more I got the money the more I got the problems.
Let me clear my book gotta make sure you hear me go

[chorus]

It’s already done aint got no pain anymore
All this pain that I
I know it was wrong for what I did.
and I make some mistakes cause I’m human.

and I aint gonna beat it to the negative.
imma keep grinding.

This is Graffiti.

---Lyrics submitted by KGMM.

I was 15 a Virginia nigga with ambitions
Young but I envisioned fucking them bad bitches
Live my life with no regrets
I tried to show respect but you don’t give it
I guess you don’t understand winning
It might take me a life time to take it back
And it might take you a life time to know the facts
Yeah just cuz we different don’t mean we distant 
And if you kill a man aint no way to bring him back
Yeah they say its mind over matter
But what we living for what really matters
Some niggas silver spoon just on a platter
And other niggas is just doomed for disaster
All along sleeping in my bedroom
As I wet the sheets mama gon’ be dead soon
Cuz a man beat her but he don’t realize she important to this family
Like a fucking heir loom
Yeah a nigga still found his way out
Record deal came a nigga played out
My mama living good she taking days out
They saying boy all that hard work paid off
500 racks for a hour show
But I aint never gonna do no 60 minute interview
Cuz all you wanna do is twist my words up
And all I wanna do is flip my birds up
Kinda tipsy off that red rum murda
Im a singing ass nigga I know you hurda
Me everyday my cliques stunting
Niggas  talking down but imma make them pick their words up
I done said all I had to say whatevs
Cock suckers low blowing under my belt
Yeah they hanging from the tip trying get a sip
Don’t let them get a grip 
I’m pissing on them myself
19 a nigga went through a tragedy
3 years a nigga just found a better me
Yeah you might find another lover
But you always started with Breezy like the letter B
Nightmares feeling haunted
Thinking do I really like this thug shit
Huh because fame aint freedom
And this diamond chain only mean they hold you hostage
Now I got a lot of offers telling me they wear they clothes
And they wanna be my sponsors
But when a nigga fall off again they be like off him
And then gonna smile up in your face just like awesome
Great wait police and the thug cannot relate
I guess why this wars on drugs is a debate
So I’m gon keep living my life from day to day…Learn from my mistakes---Lyrics submitted by Ashanti Black.

Something like Pinnochio, 
If you lie down imma grow, 
Wanna see me do it big, 
I can show you how it goes, 
Take you from an amateur to being professional, 
I can have you swag surfing 

What you need, you can have that,

See potential in ya, let me mould that

Chorus

[Lil Wayne]
Ok, 
I can transform ya like a transformer, 
I can turn you from a human to a Carter, 
Take you off the bench and turn ya to a starter, 
Then take you home and put you on a charger, 
Then (then) my cars transforms to a charter, 
And we can fly to wherever you ever thought of, 
Hehe, I take you to wherever it's warmer, 
Then I gotta rip off your dress like a warm up, 
Hehe, but I'm just getting warmed up, 
So tell your man he better get his voltron up, 
I transform her to a Ducati and then I transform me to a Bugatti, 
Cos her form puts me in a trance, 
I transform smaller and she puts me in her pants, 
Swiss on the Beat, Chris move ya feet
And we can transform a good girl to a freak,

Gimme a headstart, thank God, gonna have me like hallelujah
Even though I'm a man girl, you making me feel like a baby
Oh girl when you lay in my arms, I'll take advantage of the moment
Girl the way you make me smile is the definition of a real lady

Oh I need a back talk, girl I'm your daddy, no sass talk
Oh baby girl you inspire me, give me the reason to keep on
My baby, my Royalty, girl you're the lyrics to my song
Girl you got this heart lock on me, I don't think I can control it
I hold on with all my might while you look at me in my eye
Like a vitamin you put back my energy, you're making me stronger, and bring out the best of me

So before I go to work, can I ask you a favour?

Wake me up before you go, ooh I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love
Wake me up before you go, ooh I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love
Cause your love, your love, your love
Wake me up with some more of your love
Cause your love, your love, your love
Wake me up with some more of your love---

let me show you how to keep the dice rolling
when your doing that thing over there, homie

and I’m feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away
better know that I don’t and I won’t ever stop cause
you know I gotta win everyday day, goooo

just know that you never flop me
and I know that I can be a little cocky, nooo

everytime I come a n-gga gotta set it then I got it going
then I get it, than I blow, than I shudder every little thing
that he be doing cause it doesnt matter cause I’m gonna dadadadada
then I’m gonna murder every thing and anything a badaboom a badabing
I gotta do a lot of things, and make it clearer to a couple n-ggas
that I’m always winning and I gotta get it again and again and again
and I be doing it to death and now I move a little foul
a n-gga better call a, everybody know my style

and everybody know I’m the the baddest
when I come to doing this and Im banging on my chest
and I bang in the east and I bang in the west
and I come to give you more and I never give you less
you will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press
do you really wanna know whats next, lets go
see the way we on, we be all up in the race and you know
we gotta go, don’t try to keep up with the pace
we struggling and hustling and sending in and getting in
and always gotta take it to another place
gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
and I gotta cut all throught his traffic
just to be at the top of the throne
better know I gotta have it

But you was blowing up her phone last night 
But she ain't have her ringer nor her ring on last night, oh 
Nigga, that's that nerve 
Why give a bitch your heart when she'd rather have a purse? 
Why give a bitch an inch when she'd rather have nine? 
You know how the game goes 
She be mine by half time, I'm the shit, oh 
Nigga, that's that nerve 
You all about her, and she all about hers 
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos 
And I done did everything, but trust these hoes

Smoke weed, get drunk 
She wanna see a nigga trapped 
She wanna fuck all the rappers

Lights on, stage set 
I guess I gotta put on a show again 
Cause everyone’s waiting 
Females, fly jets 
When I turn the radio on 
I hear all my songs playing, yeah 
Whatever money can buy 
I probably got it 
That’s real talk, yeah 
I see my name in the sky all over the world 
And I just sit hear saying, lucky me 

I gotta pose for the cameras 
Even when my world's falling down 
I still wear a smile 
Lucky me 
Even though I’m so damaged 
I gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd 
Lucky me 
Creating all my loved ones wanna be a star 
Cause nobody said it would be so hard 
Wouldn’t put this on no one else 
Yeahh, Lucky me 

So exclusive 
I don’t have to wait in the line 
It’s like the club is mine now 
If it was only that simple 
Then what I’m saying is easy to do 
And we know that’s not true 
Whatever money can buy 
I probably got it 
That’s real talk, yeah 
I see my name in the sky all over the world 
And I just sit hear saying, lucky me 

I gotta pose for the cameras 
Even when my world's falling down 
I still wear a smile 
Lucky me 
Even though I’m so damaged 
I gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd 
Lucky me 
Creating all my loved ones wanna be a star 
Cause nobody said it would be so hard 
Wouldn’t put this on no one else 
Yeahh, Lucky me 

My dream and it’s my heart 
The life of being a star 
You don’t even know how hard it is, do you, yeah 
Now I’m thankfully for everything 
And I’m finally becoming a man 
Now I gotta bigger a show to do 
Lucky me 

I gotta pose for the cameras 
Even when my world's falling down 
I still wear a smile 
Lucky me 
Even though I’m so damaged 
I gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd 
Lucky me 
Creating all my loved ones wanna be a star

wishing i could catch her by herself 
Waiting till she wasn't with nobody else But everytime I saw her 


I would try to call her But she was buzy checking for the sales 
Part of me was like let it go The other part of me was like let her know
But i would never het this chance in my life again gatta

There can be one only you
'Cause, baby, God could never make two
And I know you came here with your crew
But I promise you that it feels like it's just us two

Oh, I don't know what you had planned to do tonight
But I just wanna be the one to do you right
We're standing here looking at each other, baby, eye to eye
And I'm hoping that you're thinking about leaving with me tonight

Who said you can't find love in the club?
'Cause I wanna tell them they're wrong
Come on, just, baby, try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame
You gon' be my baby
Love me, love you crazy
Tell me if you with it
Baby, come and get it
Maybe try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame

Can't believe you came here all alone, baby girl, where's your lover?
Oh, it don't really matter 'cause I only wanna get to know you better
Baby, baby, baby, baby, I can stand and stare at you forever
Girl, 'cause I won't ever let you go, never

Oh, I don't know what you had planned to do tonight
Girl, I just wanna be the one to do you right
We're standing here looking at each other, baby, eye to eye
Baby, I hope that you're thinking about leaving with me tonight

Who said you can't find love in the club?
'Cause I wanna tell them they're wrong
Come on, just, baby, try a new thing

Maybe try a new thing

Homeplace, world series, sour nigga sliding in her
Baby, I'm a boss, I'm talking George Steinbrenner
Panamera, Yogi Bear'er, my two-seater Derek Jeter
Got more stripes than all these niggas
Babe Ruth balling in a Beamer
Collar on my Polo, kisses on my necklace
All my diamonds watching, now my watches getting jealous
Smoking on a bomb and my autograph Lebron's
Yeah, she told me I'm the one, that's when I only hit it once

Who said you can't find love in the club?

You gon' be my, baby
Love me, love you crazy
Tell me if you with it
Baby, come and get it
Maybe try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.

Baby Girl I think we need to sit and talk, talk, talk

Blowing up my heart then stick a pen and pop, pop, pop

You probably be alone, I probably not

And you tryna leave? Oh you trippin, tie yo show lace.!
You's a dime b*tch, cause you two-faced.
And you gave me heads and tails
Throw it at me baby, I be the wishing well
Forreal though, I know our sh*ts not perfect
We connected in our space, where our love is written in cursive
Put that rock up on your finger, paper in your hands
But you can't cut me out, b*tch this ain't no game

I need your touch, but your hands are locked away
I hear your voice, you've got nothing left to say
I'll take this start of my heart
I'll take this bullet, I'll take it for love

So if the lights in the sky come crashing down
I still can find your love even in the crowd
But will you remember me
Girl you'll remember my name,
Remember my name, will you remember my name
Remember my name (I love you, I love you, love you)
Remember my name (I love you, I love you, love you)
Remember my name (I love you, I love you, love you)

I need my kiss, but your lips are far away
So I have no choice, so I guess I'll have to stay and love away
And I'ma take this stop from my heart,
Bang bang, I take this bullet, bang bang I'll take it for love
Bang bang, I'll take it for love,
Bang bang, I'll take it for us
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/chris+brown/remember+my+name_21006653.html ]
Will you remember my name, my name, my name, my name
Remember my name, my name, my name, my name
Will you remember my name, my name, my name, my name
Remember my name, my name, my name, my name
(I love you, I love you, love you)
Remember my name (I love you, I love you, love you)
Remember my name (I love you, I love you, love you)

Floating above the clouds and sky
Wishing upon the falling star
Hoping my love hasn't forgot my name
It's automatic this is stratchin
This love is so strong
Too bad ever glad baby wishin we can float up
We can fly, higher babe, higher babe, higher babe,
Higher babe, higher babe,
Just fly high
Higher babe, higher babe, higher babe, higher babe,

I'll guess don't brace, I just wanna levitate
I'll guess no brace, I just wanna levitate
I'll guess no brace, I just wanna levitate
Just levitate, I just wanna levitate
'Cause you'll remember my name, my name,
Remember my name, my name, remember my name
Will you remember my name, remember my name
Remember my, remember my name
Remember my, remember my name---

You love another man
My heart is broken in two
She has a ring on the other hand
Too scared to tell me the truth

But, you are leaving
I want you to know that
I should've loved you way more, way more
So this is the end of us now
I'll see you around
I'll see you around
Around
You mean more to me than anything
And finished cause you don't love me

So I just wanna see you happy

Comfortable
I think that I'm losing my mind
It's crazy, cause we were so inseparable
Guess things change with time
Does he kiss and wipe away your tears
Does he tell you that there's nothing to fear
Oh, if I had a wishing well, I would have you right here

But, you are leaving
I want you to know that
I should've loved you way more, way more
So this is the end of us now
I'll see you around
I'll see you around
Around
You mean more to me than anything
And finished cause you don't love me

I didn't listen, you went missing
He has your heart now

Wish I could keep you all to myself
I wanna work it out
But you don't see it now
Oh, oh
Guess I'll see you around---

Why am I mad, I don't get it,
It seems like everytime you give me signs,
and I miss it,

I did it again,
I admit it,
I left you standing there,
And now I regret it,

It Seems like everytime,I,
Get the chance, I,
Lose my cool, and I blow it,
and I get all tongue tied,
Lost in your eyes,
I'm a fool, and I know it,

I should've Kissed you,
I should've told you,
Told you just how I feel,
And next time I won't stop,
I'll listen to my heart,
Cause what I feel is real,

I should've kissed you,
I should've told you how I feel,
I should've kissed you,
I should've showed you just how i feel,

Now why didn't I,
Give you my two cents,
A million reasons why I should have,
and it makes no sense,
So here I am,
By myself again,
Stopping for green lights, and Now I know,
I wanna be more than friends,

How come everytime I get the chance I,
Lose my cool and I blow it,
And i get all tongue tied,
Lost in your eyes,
I'm a fool and I know it,

Hey,
I should've Kissed you,
I should've told you,
Told you just how I feel,
And next time I won't stop,
I'll listen to my heart,
Cause what I feel is real,

I should've kissed you,
I should've told you how I feel,
I should've kissed you,
I should've showed you just how i feel,

So I turned the car around,
And you were right where I left you,
And your smile said you were feeling me too,
And the moon shined bright,
Cause when your lips met mine,
And yeah I finally got it right,
I'll be leaving with you tonight,
And I won't have to say,

I should've Kissed you,
I should've told you,
Told you just how I feel,
And next time I won't stop,
I'll listen to my heart,
Cause what I feel is real,

I should've kissed you,
I should've showed you just how I feel,
I should've kissed you,
I should've showed you just how i feel,

Girl I should've kissed you,
I should've told you, told you just how I feel,
And this time I won't stop,
Until I have your heart,
Because This feeling is real.---Lyrics submitted by taylor.

Damn,I want my baby back 
It's so cold without her 
Cold without her 
She's gone 
Now I'm alone, no one to hold on 
Cause she was the only one 
And I know I dead wrong 
But if you youuuu 
If youuu 
See her sooonn 
Ask her will she forgive me 

If you ever see her 
If you ever meet her 
If you ever get a chance to sit down, talk to her 
Then tell her it's so cold 
It's so cold, it's so cold 
Here without her 
And tell her I miss her 
Tell her I need her 
Tell her I want her 
I really want her to come back home, back to keep me warm 
Tell her I'm sorry, I'm really sorry 
Can you forgive me? 
Please forgive me 
And come back home, keep me safe and warm 

Now my baby's really gone 
I don't know if she's coming home 
My love's up, I fucked up 
I know 
Tell me what to do to get her back 
Back where her heart belongs, been gone from me for way too long 

So if youuu, seen my boo 
Please can youuuu 
Can you tell her for me 

If you ever see her 
If you ever meet her 
If you ever get a chance to sit down and talk to her 
Then tell her it's so cold 
It's so cold, it's so cold 
Here without her 
And tell her I miss her 
Tell her I need her 
Tell her I want her 
I really want her to come back home, back to keep me warm 
Tell her I'm sorry, I'm really sorry 
Can you forgive me? 
Please forgive me 
And come back home, keep me safe and warm 

If you ever see her 
If you ever meet her 
If you ever get a chance to sit down and talk to her 
Let her know it's so cold 
It's so cold, it's so cold 
Wïthout her---Lyrics submitted by chantelle.

You're a goddess in the bedroom
Devil in them skintights
Drug that, I'm hooked to
But it's ok, I'll be alright
Tried my best to please you
Show you what it means to
Be a victim of love
So turn on that red light, Oh
Turn on that red light
Ooh, eh

We gon' be bumping and grinding
Seems like you're ready to sex me, baby, baby
And I'm feeling on your booty, driving me crazy
Half on a baby
Cause' your body's calling me
And with your permission let me start your ignition
Don't you know that you're reminding me
Of a song on 12 play
You're like a song on 12 play

Fuckin' with an R&B thug
You gon' have the greatest sex
Do you mind if I stroke you up
Baby girl, imagine that
Dripping that honey love, I'm a hit it hard from the back
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh - just like that
Do your body like a real freak (have a little private)
Fiesta, fiesta
Somebody's girl is on my body
Naked, shaking
Etcetera, et cetera, et cetera
Hey baby

We gon' be bumping and grinding
Seems like you're ready to sex me, baby, baby
And I'm feeling on your booty, driving me crazy
Half on a baby
Cause' your body's calling me
And with your permission let me start your ignition
Don't you know that you're reminding me
Of a song on 12 play
You're like a song on 12 play

Ok, foreplay, that's child's play
Making love is my forte
Shots of you when I'm thirsty
Damn right, I'm a eat that pussy
Clothes all in the background
I give a back shot, I don't back down
She likes her hair pulled, that ass slapped around
And the neighbours screaming out
"Keep it down"

Baby turn on the red light tonight
Lil' mama, it'll be alright
I just wanna be all on you
Do it 'til we both can't move
Your body
Your hips, Your ass, girl
Sweat dripping on my body,
Like this my last girl
So tonight

We gon' be bumping and grinding
Seems like you're ready to sex me, baby, baby
And I'm feeling on your booty, driving me crazy
Half on a baby
Cause' your body's calling me
And with your permission let me start your ignition
Don't you know that you're reminding me
Of a song on 12 play
You're like a song on 12 play

Oh na na na na na na, down low, down low
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby baby
Keep it on the down low, down low ---

Why are my hands bleeding?
I think I know why, I've been holding on
To the words from your every lie
Fool me once, shame on you, baby
Fool me twice, should have know that there would be problems girl
With you
But I thought

You were different
Now I see you're just like the rest
Thought you were different
You'd become my biggest regret

I'd really hate to label you a stereotype
I'd really hate to label you a stereotype
I'd really hate to label you a stereotype
Stereotype, stere-stereotype
Stereotype, stere-stereotype
Stereotype, stere-stereotype
Stereotype, stere-stere-ere-ere-o

Can't blame you
You were only being yourself
I fell in love with someone that I barely knew, why?
Fool me once, shame on you, baby
Fool me twice, should have know that there would be problems girl
With you
But I thought

You were different
Now I see you're just like the rest
Thought you were different
You'd become my biggest regret

Nice thighs, nice waist, and you know I cant forget about your face

Let me see you back it up and drop
Yeah, I wanna see your legs in the air
Baby don't worry about your hair, all those tracks

Red bottom heels, you can take em, wait wait, leave em on cause I like my women tall
You got it hot mama, you're hotter than sauna
I wanna peel them clothes off your body like a banana
The only reason why I dress you in that designer, is to get you out that Dolce and Gabbana
I throw this money up, she watch it all fall
Toot that thang up, ...
Anything you want baby, you can have it all
Starting with my last name, now they call you Ms. McCall

[Verse 1:]
Am I crazy? Am I foolish?
Just a little too into you
That's for sure
(Ooh babe)
But your beauty,
That is in me
Makes me forget about your faults
You do no wrong
Ooh woah ooh oh hoh oh

[Bridge:]
They say everybody plays the fool sometimes
And if I got to,
I don't mind
I'll be the best damn fool for you,
No lie
And girl I loose it every time

[Hook:]
There's something about you, baby
And I swear that it drives me crazy
I'm stuck on you baby,
Stuck on you baby
And I might need help,
Cause I can't think of nothing else
You got me stuck on stupid,
Stuck on stupid for you
Look what you do to me

[Verse 2:]
It's confusing,
How you do it
It's like you take my heart and glue it to your soul,
Yeah baby
And I'll do anything for you,
Ooh you know that much it's true
Girl I'm so in love,
I'm stupid

[Bridge]
They say everybody plays the fool sometimes
And if I got to,
I don't mind
I'll be the best damn fool for you,
No lie
And girl I loose it every time

There's something about you, baby
And I swear that it drives me crazy
I'm stuck on you baby,

Stuck on stupid for you
Ooh ooh ooh
Look what you do to me

[Verse 3:]
If you told me to go rock climbing
To prove my love to you
You know I would've died trying
Got everything to lose
I'm gon' try to play it cool
The stupid things I do,
I do it for you

[Hook]
There's something about you, baby
And I swear that it drives me crazy
I'm stuck on you baby,
Stuck on you baby
And I might need help,
Cause I can't think of nothing else
You got me stuck on stupid,
Stuck on stupid for you
Look what you do to me ---

[Chris:]
Weak
I have been crying and crying for weeks
How'd I survive when I can barely speak
Barely eat
On my knees

[Keri:]
But that's the moment you came to me
I don't know what your love has done to me
Think I'm invincible I see
Through the me
I used to be

[Chorus:]
[Chris:]
You changed my whole life
[Keri:]
Don't know what your doing to me with your love
[Chris:]

[Chris:]
Strong
Since I've been flying and righting the wrongs
Feels almost like i had it all along
I can see tomorrow
[Keri:]
But every problem is gone because
I flew everywhere with love inside of me
It's unbelievable to see
How love could set me free

[Chorus:]
[Both:]
You changed my whole life
Don't know what your doing to me with your love
I'm feeling all Super human
You did that to me
Super human heart beats in me
Nothing can stop me here with you, superhuman
Super human
[Chris:]

[Chris:]

Not a plane

[Both:]
My only weakness is you
Only reason is you
Every minute with you I feel like I can do
Anything

[Chorus:]
[Both:]
Going going I'm going away
In love
You changed my whole life
Don't know what your doing to me with your love
I'm feeling all Super human
You did that to me
Super human heart beats in me
Nothing can stop me here with you, superhuman
Super human

[Verse 1 - Chris Brown]
Yo, this Virginia
Straight from the country, right there wit my kinfolk
Golds and my mouth and they put 26's on Benzo's
Dirt roads, back wood
They got weed but I've been dope
Ratchet, nigga we act hood
But I'm getting money with these white folk
Sippin and I'm faded, super medicated
Said she wanna check the pole
I said Okay Sarah Palin, so I lay down and lay in
A nigga gon' be faded, all the way to the AM

[Hook]
More drink, pour it up
More weed, roll it up
Whoa there ho, you know wassup

Pimps up, hoes down

Damn bitch I do it

And this the life we chose
Workin' all night
Swear I'm never going broke
And I'mma do this till I die
And I ain't talking shit just cause I'm, just cause I'm...
(I'm high)

Oh God, oh God

[Big Sean]
Ok, wow, bow
Look at me now, chief like a indian
Talkin in clouds, I'm high as a bitch
I'm talking to clouds
Off tree every night like I roam with the owls
I super soak that ho, show 'em no love just throw em a towel
Still rocking Louis Vuitton condom, cause I'm so fucking in style, wow
New crib, crash that. Drove here, cab back
Now knock that pussy out, yeah that's just a little cat nap
Hold up, hold up woah
Don't be smoking my shit, I be smoking that fire
And she be smoking my dick

[Hook]

More weed, roll it up

[Wiz Khalifa]
Smoking, choking, always rollin' something
I don't need a key to start my car
Bitch I just push a button and did a show
Got a half a mill and spent it like it's nothing
Money flowing, never sober
Smoking till I got concussion, no discussion
Man I got a condo and got a big crib
Pounds all over my kitchen is
If I ain't on the road gettin' it
Then I'm in the hood where my niggas live
Did a tour, sold it out, just bought a pound 'bout to finish it
Now all my pasta got shrimp in it
You talk about and I'm living it
Fucking little bitch

[Hook]
More drink, pour it up
More weed, roll it up
Whoa there ho, you know wassup
Quit hoggin' the blunt bitch, slow down
Pimps up, hoes down
Ass up, nose down

Real nigga never frontin'

Middle finger in the air no fist pump
And me, Sean and Wiz got this bitch jumping
Ah! Finally got this bitch jumping
Got this bitch jumpin'
Fly...that's me... ---

I don't know if it's your scent or your kiss
But I girl I love it
And time after time,
You give me one of the greatest gifts
I want you to

I want you to love me
Like you never loved nobody else
And I want you to touch me
Like when your touching yourself

So baby come over (I'm on my way girl)
If you take your time
You can love me right
(Gonna love it, uh-huh, set the time girl)
If you want me to slow it down
(I do, do you, I will, will you, I will)
Bite into the pillow, try not to make a sound

Girl, it's okay, cause I want you to feel me, yeah
Cause your daddy's girl, I'm a show you how to love,
Show you how to love me girl

So lay down right there
So you can hold my head
While I'm kissing on your thighs
Girl I just need it one more time

I want you to love me
Like you never loved nobody else (can you do me girl)
And I want you to touch me
Like when your touching yourself

And as I look into your eyes
Your body screams for my love
No fear, just me,
And as you feel me inside
My passion fits like a glove
No more fear, just you and me

I want you to love me
Like you never loved nobody else
And I want you to touch me
Like when your touching yourself ---Lyrics submitted by Tatyanna Bennett.

It's time to celebrate like I just touched down
Know we getting ready to party
I'ma show you how
Yeah shit happens but tonight we don't care
I just wanna see you put your hands in the air and say

Hey little mama all that ass in them pants
Drop it like you're single even though you got a man
Puerto Rican with a Spanish accent
Hands on the floor dancing like we sexing

Gonna be the, I'm gonna be the
Gonna be the, I'm gonna be the
Gonna be the, I'm gonna be the one you

If I asked to kiss ya
Would you say yes or turn and walk away, oh baby
See I must admit girl
Cause all the crazy things that go through my head
Woahhh Oh oh No

[Hook 1:]
It seemed just like the perfect move at the time
For me to make you mine
(Girl you sexy from head to toe)
You said you think we should wait a while
And it might be hard but

[Hook 2:]
But I won't complain
You could've been anywhere else but you're here with me
Oh yeah
We can travel to space
As long as I got you right here next to me
I'm straight
Woahhhhhh, girl I'll wait
Ohhhhhhhh, for you, yes I will
Ohhhhhhhh, I said I'll wait for you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I just wanna love ya
Lord knows that I can't wait for the day
Na, Nahhhhh

Baby, I swear I'll do whatever it takes
(To keep you here with me)

[Hook 1:]
It seemed just like the perfect move at the time
For me to make you mine
(Girl you sexy from head to toe)
You said you think we should wait a while
Girl it might be hard but

[Hook 2: Chris Brown & Se7en]
But I won't complain
You could've been anywhere else but you're here with me
Oh yeah

As long as I got you right here next to me

Woahhhhhh, girl I'll wait
Ohhhhhhhh, for you, yes I will
Ohhhhhhhh, I said I'll wait for you

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
It's been awhile and we both know that I've been patient girl
Cause you ain't been trying to give it up, nooooo

You can tell as soon as I approach her
When you feelin' uptight, get it right
Don't fight, lighten up like Sammy Sosa

Women call me the super soaker
And I'ma soak your bed to death
How long can you hold your breath?

Asthma attackin'
Wakin' up wonderin' what happened
Makin' me hot like Toni Braxton
You can't deny you wanna break my back in

Hot little figure, yes, you a winner

I swear the whole world stops, you're my sweetheart
And I'm so glad that you're mine
You are one of a kind

And, girl, no one else would do
Cause with every kiss and every hug
You make me fall in love

Who feel what I feel when I'm

With you, with you, with you
With you, with you, girl
With you, with you, with you
With you, with you, oh girl

I don't want nobody else
Without you there's no one left and
You're like Jordan's on Saturday
I gotta have you and I cannot wait now

Hey, little shorty, say you care for me
You know I care for you, you know that I'll be true
You know that I won't lie, you know that I will try
To be your everything, yeah

Cause if I got that then I'll be straight
Baby, you're the best part of my day

If you had a choice then
what would you choose to do.

I could live without money
I could live without the fame,
and if everyday was sunny i could live
without the rain, and if i ever
went up to heaven i would fall
right back down, that life wouldn't be living
cause your the one i couldn't live without.

if i couldnt blink would i still be able to see you?
i couldnt imagine
without arms could i reach,
no way could i ever hold you
i need these things like i need you
if u had a choice what would you choose.

I could live without money
I could live without the fame,
and if everyday was sunny i could live
without the rain, and if i ever
went up to heaven i would fall
right back down, that life wouldn't be living
cause your the one i couldnt live without.

If i couldn't dream would i believe that
there could be a you and me.
and if i couldn't sing would you be
able to hear my melody.
i know that somethings wrong and im afraid
that your moving on.
How can i fly when your my wings.
i need these things like i need you
if you had a choice what would you choose.

I could live without money
I could live without the fame,
and if everyday was sunny i could live
without the rain, and if i ever
went up to heaven i would fall
right back down, that life wouldn't be living
cause your the one i couldnt live without.

You can take it all from me
and it wouldnt mean anything .
Turn the whole world against me
as long as you dont leave.
Its getting hard for me to sleep
even harder for me to breath.
Im used to life with you, tell me what i need to do.

I could live without money
I could live without the fame,
and if everyday was sunny i could live
without the rain, and if i ever
went up to heaven i would fall
right back down, that life wouldn't be living
cause your the one i couldnt live without.

I could live without money
I could live without the fame,
and if everyday was sunny i could live
without the rain, and if i ever
went up to heaven i would fall
right back down, that life wouldn't be living
cause your the one i couldnt live without.---Lyrics submitted by Nderim.

If you're only as good as the company you keep
Then I'mma blame you for what they say about me
(Free your mind, and let your conscience be free)
When I was by myself I was fast asleep
Since you came around I've been up for weeks
(Free your mind, and let your conscience be free)
Yi-yi-yikes I've been with the wrong crowd
I can make you a believer, if I turn the nonsense down
I keep my secrets in a safehouse, better if I don't speak
Devil's tryna tempt me, they just outline my shape out
Place me at the crime scene
I can see from this high up, you ain't got a heart girl
Privacy is for the cheater obviously you're deceiving

I know
I know just who you are
You put me on lay away
You just love to heart shop
I think that it's over
I think that it's over

I swear to god I'm moving on
(Mm, back up)
I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more
I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more
(I ain't tripping of you you you you)
I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more
(I ain't tripping of you you you)
I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more

You just start a fight, I ain't fighting back I'm cool with it
I, simply came here to party
Why, would I trip off that bullshit, when I'm on that good shit
I swear to god I'm moving on
(Mm, back up)

Substitute love for a better thing
I deal with my pain like a lonely child
I didn't build these walls for you to piss all on my past oh
Go ahead burn it down, I'mma build me another one
All these clouds...

I know
I know just who you are
You put me on lay away
You just love to heart shop
I think that it's over
I think that it's over

I swear to god I'm moving on
(Mm, back up)
I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more
I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more
(I ain't tripping of you you you you)
I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more
(I ain't tripping of you you you)
I ain't go back no more, I ain't go back no more

You just start a fight, I ain't fighting back I'm cool with it

I thought we were great
You took your love back and ran us off track
I count all the days,
'Til you would come back, how stupid was that?

Now you're missing what we used to have
Guess the vodka brought the feeling back
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now, if you really want to know

Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one, then you turned and runned
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That's how many fucks I give

Wake up with a dime
Get up to no good better than you could
Go out, free our minds
Like you never would, never understood

Now you're missing what we used to have
You been creepin round my Instagram
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now, if you really wanna know

Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one, then you turned around
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That's how many fucks I give

Broke back then but a nigga rich now
Got dollars, got euros, got yen, I got pounds
Zeros, zeros
Calling me up cause your bank check bounced
My new chick one hundred
And she got her own dinero, zero
You think I'm thinking about your ass?

Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one, then you turned around
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That's how many fucks I give,
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That's how many fucks I give---
