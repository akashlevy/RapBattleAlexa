If I could freak ya, give me the word and I’ll be along

Flo Rida I got a story to tell (story to tell, story to tell),
There once was a man that lived in a shoe,
Next to a bakery that I knew,
His excuse he had a sweet tooth,
Ever since the days of his youth,
I love cake, he said me too,
Tastes so good I drive in the coupe (Err day),
Traffic come through (err day),
Capture that loot,
For some strange reason that shop never close,
And everybody leave have powder on they nose,
Dunk in line, Betty Crocker bank row,

[Rick Ross]:
We eatin' every day, go check my resume,
I'm blowing Mary Jane, off in this 7 tre,
Yea I got 20 whips, close to 40 women,
So I get plenty lips, I love swimmin',
I'm shinin' every day, you shinin' once a year,
Multi millionaire, I had a monster year,
We own monster trucks, so ya we crush yea haters,
Never squashin beef, got too much paper,
You don't know, you better look around,
Poe boy's the biggest crooks in town,
Hood niggas like put me down,
Fifty grand just to put me now,
Rollin up on the good weed now,
Who you hoes call and fuck me now,
Baddest chicks wanna fuck me now,
They screamin loud like it's a damn touchdown,

[Chorus (Flo Rida)]:
I could spend a hundred thousand in a day,
Getting cake er day (er day), er day (er day),
Comin through yo hood in that 7 tre,
Getting cake er day (er day), er day (er day),
I told ya'll, I don't want no cake on my birthday,
I want my cake er day (maan), er day (maan),
I could spend a hundred thousand in a day,
Getting cake er day (er day), er day (er day),

[Flo Rida]:
I don't want cake on the day I was born,
I want my cake like I woke up in yawn,
Flo Rida fought like a cat play with yarn,
Look at my stacks I hatin the thorn,
Rubber bands on the hundred grand,
I'm in love with that cake from oven man,
I'm in a trap with a bakin' that oven man,
Cristal, rose keep bubblin',
If you ain't talkin' bout your birthday,
You ain't probably had cake in the first place,
I go hard until the block get first aid,
Do my part and Poe Boy my birth place,
Stallin the block like Monday Tuesday,
Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday,
I'm still in the hood, ain't got away,
Carol City all good in Mi. A.,
I'm on my grind, I gotta have my dunk in line's,
Betty Crocker on my mind, everyday, 365,
Flo-rida own the bakery line,
Look at them? chasin me now,
I'm gettin domes for basically dimes,
Do what I want I got dollar signs,

[Chorus (Flo Rida)]:
I could spend a hundred thousand in a day,
Getting cake err day (err day) err day (err day),
Comin through yo hood in that 7 tre,
Getting cake err day (er rday) err day (err day),
I told ya'll, I don't want no cake on my birthday,
I want my cake err day (maan) err day (maan),
I could spend a hundred thousand in a day,
Getting cake err day (err day) err day (err day),

[Brisco:]
Happy Birthday,
Baby what's your birth place, where your birth Ma,
What's your zodiac and birthday day,
Who gettin money, that's the only cake I ever knew,
50 thousand the closest thing to candles I ever blew,
I close my eyes, made a wish and it came true,
Now I'm rockin clubs, arenas and all the bigger venues,
Everyday we ballin', tippin that Phantom price,
Hit the club I come out wearin all the ice,
I know the wrist enticing, like the Bentley bright,
Somthin like a big song lightin it, wrist came hard,
And I can do it again, see Flo Rida like my brother, yea he my twin,

[Chorus (Flo Rida)]:
I could spend a hundred thousand in a day,
Getting cake err day (err day) err day (err day),
Comin through yo hood in that 7 tre,
Getting cake er day (err day) err day (err day),
I told y'all, I don't want no cake on my birthday,
I want my cake err day (maan) err day (maan),
I could spend a hundred thousand in a day,
Getting cake err day (err day) err day (err day),

[Rick Ross:]
Boss, yea, it's a hit baby, Flo-Rida, we rich homie, Poe Boy Entertainment

I wanna see that babu I am bam, baram bam baram

Uh, I think I found one ‘cause I got that fever of...
Gotta self around one, ass like Serena, that’s okay
‘cause I love my stereotypes, my girls in tools
That maximum exposure... know what I wanna do,
Telling all the girls, all around the world, my last name must be Robin
‘cause I’m basking in these asses, all thirty flavours keep calling,
My my my my vanilla Cinderella love it when I tell her drop it,
A butt of... but I love my chocolate.

Flow right to Pitbull anything,

Ustedes saben quien es quien
Mira salinga con toda esa...
Como tu sabes estoy loco.
Pero que bueno que era poco,
Mami mueve los coco,

As long as you got that...

[Chorus:]

Turn around you could tell what I like

Roll up machilles don't smoke arizona 
One night stand one night with the clan 
One night, one time broke her off 10 grand. 
Project all the way gutta all day 
Computer on first thang, while we in this thing 
Shorty don't fake she'll put it in your face 
Three stories while them hood rats beg 

Got you stuck on my (yeah) 
On my elevator (uhuh) 
Get it up, on my elevator 
Check it out!

Second floor, stuck on the dime piece 
Third floor, stuck on the hood rat 
Fourth floor, freak it I don't know, cause...

Yes I can, doubt that I leave, I'm running with this plan
Pull me, grab me, crabs in the bucket can't have me
I'll be the president one day
January first, oh, you like that gossip
Like you the one drinking what God sip dot com
Now I gotta work with your tongue
How many rolling stones you want
Yeah I got a brand new spirit,
Speak it and it's done
Woke up on the side of the bed like I won
Talk like a winner, my chest to that sun
G5 dealer, US to Taiwan
Now who can say that, I wanna play back
Mama knew I was a needle in a hay stack
A Bugatti boy, plus Maybach
I got a feeling it's a wrap, ASAP

One second, I'ma strike oil
Diamond, platinum, no more for you
Got adrenaline, never giving in
Giving up's not an option, gotta get it in
Witness I got the heart of 20 men
No fear, go to sleep in the lion's den
That flow, that spark, that crown
You looking at the king of the jungle now
Stronger than ever can't hold me down
A hundred miles gunnin' from the pitcher's mound
Straight game face, it's game day
See me running through the crowd full of melee
No trick plays, I'm Bill Gates,
Take a genius to understand me

Oh, oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
I get a feeling that I never never never never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

[Flo-rida:]
Florida I got a story to tell (story to tell, story to tell), 
There once was a man that lived in a shoe, 
Next to a bakery that I knew, 
His excuse he had a sweet tooth, 
Ever since the days of his youth, 
I love cake, he said me too, 
Tastes so good I drive in the coupe (Er day), 
Traffic come through (er day), 
Capture that loot, 
For some strange reason that shop never close, 
And everybody leave have powder on they nose, 
Duncan Hines, Entenmanns, Betty Crocker bank row, 

[Rick Ross:]
We eatin' every day, go check my resume, 
I'm blowing Mary Jane, off in this 7 tre, 
Yea I got 20 whips, close to 40 women, 
So I get plenty lips, I love swimmin', 
I'm shinin' every day, you shinin' once a year, 
Multi millionaire, I had a monster year, 
We own monster trucks, so ya we crush yea haters, 
Never squashin beef, got too much paper, 
You don't know, you better look around, 
Poe boy's the biggest crooks in town, 
Hood n****** like put me down, 
Fifty grand just to put me now, 
Rollin up on the good weed now, 
Who you hoes call and f*** me now, 
Badest chicks wanna f*** me now, 
They screamin loud like it's a damn touchdown, 

I could spend a hundred thousand in a day, 
Getting cake er day (er day), er day (er day), 
Comin through yo hood in that 7 tre, 
Getting cake er day (er day), er day (er day), 
I told ya'll, I don't want no cake on my birthday, 
I want my cake er day (maan), er day (maan), 
I could spend a hundred thousand in a day, 
Getting cake er day (er day), er day (er day), 

[Flo-rida:]
I don't want cake on the day I was born, 
I want my cake like I woke up in yawn, 
Flo-rida fought like a cat play with yarn, 
Look at my stacks I hatin the thorn, 
Rubber bands on the hundred grand, 
I'm in love with that cake from oven man, 
I'm in a trap with a bakin' that oven man, 
Cristal, rose keep bubblin', 
If you ain't talkin' bout your birthday, 
You ain't probably had cake in the first place, 
I go hard until the block get first aid, 
Do my part and Poe Boy my birth place, 
Stallin the block like Monday Tuesday, 
Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday, 
I'm still in the hood, ain't got away, 
Carol City all good in Mi. A., 
I'm on my grind, I gotta have my dunk in line's, 
Betty Crocker on my mind, everyday, 365, 
Flo-rida own the bakery line, 
Look at them? chasin me now, 
I'm gettin domes for basically dimes, 
Do what I want I got dollar signs, 

I could spend a hundred thousand in a day, 
Getting cake er day (er day) er day (er day), 
Comin through yo hood in that 7 tre, 
Getting cake er day (er day) er day (er day), 
I told ya'll, I don't want no cake on my birthday,

Getting cake er day (er day) er day (er day), 

[Brisco:]
Happy Birthday, 
Baby what's your birth place, where your birth Ma, 
What's your zodiac and birthday day, 
Who gettin money, that's the only cake I ever knew, 
50 thousand the closest thing to candles I ever blew, 
I close my eyes, made a wish and it came true, 
Now I'm rockin clubs, arenas and all the bigger venues, 
Everyday we ballin', tippin that Phantom price, 
Hit the club I come out wearin all the ice, 
I know the wrist enticing, like the Bentley bright, 
Somthin like a big song lightin it, wrist came hard, 
And I can do it again, see Flo-rida like my brother, yea he my twin, 

I could spend a hundred thousand in a day, 
Getting cake er day (er day) er day (er day), 
Comin through yo hood in that 7 tre, 
Getting cake er day (er day) er day (er day), 
I told ya'll, I don't want no cake on my birthday, 
I want my cake er day (maan) er day (maan), 
I could spend a hundred thousand in a day, 
Getting cake er day (er day) er day (er day),

If you're waiting for the moment, here it is
If you're aiming for the heart then you can't miss
You wanna know oh oh oh oh, where's the love
Here it is
Where's the love, where's the love
Here it is

Yeah I'm back like Thriller, get up
Ready for the build up
Sinner baby I'm no saint
I'm a stone cold winner, picture money where your mouth is
They can never break my bank
But the way you go, go now baby now you've got it
Turn around, you know that I want it
There's only really one thing that I gotta know-ow
Where in the world you're dropping it
I got the dollars and I'm ready to sponsor it
I got the guava with the cheese, no laundering
... collar stain killing my confidence

Give you that XO freebie
Let's go, repeat
Come and get some of this L-O-V-E
You know what I want, I know you need
Ooh-ah, ooh-ah
Let me tell you now

Hey now I can tell
You the one I wanted from a mile away
Ain't nobody looking like you up in here
Good times written all over your face
Yeah cause the way you show
Show me, show out, show me all your talents
Whoa now, throw me all of balance
Ay good girl, I'm a real bad habit
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Ain't no debate I'm heaven sent
I'm bout to take you to the places you've never been
Keep you up all night, I'm Letterman
Sick with it, I'ma bring you the medicine

You wanna do it all day
I give you the Flo and I let you ride it baby
Good lovin' don't play, give me the show
Oh yeah I like the way you roll roll roll it
Keep the party going
There's really only one thing I gotta know-oh---

(Chorus)
Birds flying high
You know how I feel
It’s a new day,
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
It’s a new day,
You know how I feel

(Verse 1)
Yea I’m a new man baby
Yo other man probably should follow my bank plan baby
Strap on yo seat and get ready to go
You know we feelin', be 43 million feet up in the sky full of diamonds
I’m only beginning then I get the feeling that we had yo people to light this
I got a few Miami vices
I don’t never look at the prices
My super bow flickers are priceless
You know who the king
And the night is beautiful
Music for you to go low
I’m feeling a bit awkward, this moment I think I’m bout home

(Chorus)
Birds flying high
You know how I feel
It’s a new day,
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
You know how I feel
It’s a new day,
You know how I feel

(Verse 2)
What a feeling I get when I throw up my pistol, somebody is bigger than life
50 bottles of lumen, it’s Dom Perignon, bout my dollars, we good for the night
Cameras flickin', I see me and vixen
I’m fixin my call on my natural high
She can get it, my whole clique is with it
No question, we over, it’s everything bout it
This ho'w I ride, my passenger fly
We took off in London and land in Dubai
This is America, music my ride
My life is so lavish, you don’t recognize
So let’s toast to a new day and vouch yea
80 million and still rolling, hold still
Both of us agree to this compulsion
I got this melody so we’re like vultures

Who told y'all the party’s over
Well it ain’t over til I told ya
I fill my cup, running over
Tomorrow I might be sober
But tonight I’m like

Birds flying high
It’s a new day
You know how I feel
Sun in the sky
It’s a new day,
You know how I feel---

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

I know you wanna get behind the wheel Only 1 Rida
Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to japan quake losers and survivors
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to sound better but the killer was a Coward
Face just showers, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news all day went sour
Lil mama got me feeling like a limit here
Put you in the box just the presidents cigarettes
Give em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers just the young & restless
Get mad coz the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said I was driving reckless
You & I or jealously was not oppressive
Oh no I can't stop I was Destined

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

Champagne buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tattoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get depressed coz the outfit all in it
Coz the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next get a call just a lil visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Rihanna kiss you on ya neck just kill critics
Buggatti never when I'm rich, just god fearing
Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Mr mike caren, tell his Billie Jeans
I'm on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live tryna figure how your sister vanish
No cheers I know you wouldn't panic

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know its all better now

When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know its all better now

When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know its all better now

When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know its all better now

I know, I know, I know, I I I, I think of letting go

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go---Lyrics submitted by Jeanette Caldwe.

I don't like it, I love it, love it, love it, uh oh

All out, turn the beat up
Hey now I'm glad to meet ya
Turn up girl, blow the speaker

Billionaire bottles, we just down em like
Ain't no problem, all my roads are right
All right, all right

I don't like it, I love it
I got another comin' in my budget
I got a anaconda in my truck fit
Don't push it, don't push it
Cause I'ma hit it til I jackpot, that's right
Wax on baby wax off, act right
You can put it on the black card, all night
And I'll spend it, I'll spend it cause

All night, let me group ya
Dance with me, turn down for who girl
Another runner help us step the moves up
Yeah bet that round need a measure or ruler
Celebrate life and I'll pay for it
That Cavalli nice next to my Tom Ford
Yeah party all night, let's all aboard
Let's all aboard, all aboard

I don't like it, I love it
And them other girl they can't touch it
Competition, that's a whole nother subject
I wanna walk it out in public
You a star baby, just know, let's go
To the mansion or the condo, let's go
Perfect time gotta let it flow, you know
I'm watching, I'm watching, cause

Meet me at the studio
Bangarang just like Ruffio
Feel the base, let ya booty go
I wanna get inside it
Run away for a few days
Thinkin' bout love, baby touche
Tied up like a shoe lace
I don't like it, I don't like it

I don't like it, no, I love it
I don't like it, no, I love it
I don't like it, no, I love it
I don't like it, no, I love it---

In my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we’re waiting for

And In my mind, in my head, this is where we all came from
The dreams we have, the love we share
This is what we’re waiting for

I'm waiting for a smile
Waiting for this time, waiting for this moment
To step into the light
Got the street up in my club
One night to live it up
You know I'm not stopping till we...hell no

Perfect brother, can I tell you---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.

My clique pour up, and every bad chick know us
Dance, the boy got us all feelin high

Butterfly and spur, and I got a couple words

Hey girl, come on baby, you a fine sexy lady

Sky high, still clubbin like I’m part of the mile high
Ears poppin, Bubbalicious help me get right
Keep poppin in position after midnight
Moese? fried chicken up in NY
Jigga what, don’t it feel good
Houston We gonna jump ship, all aboard

Love is nice when it’s understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me tripping why our love is old
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll

It’s like Woodstock…brand new billion
And bark to the music, sucker than a psychic
My heart beat acoustic, moves like Hendrick
Walk to a fire, then I flame and kiss it
Go hard in my lambo, strikes and a visit
To meeting in the rain, gotta roll with the vision
Vision of a good time, all I wanna know
When the party gonna stop, let the good times roll
Come on let’s go, you gotta …
Get the party on the roll, ain’t nothing like the feeling
When you’re winning in your soul
The wheel keep spinning, only got one love
Stop, stop the show, and stop, stop the flow
The world ain’t ready cause I rock the globe
So act like you know, act like you know
Act like to know, just what to do
When the good times roll

Love is nice when it’s understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me tripping why our love is old
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll

Come on baby, let the good times roll

Roll is on, everybody getting taste of the…
Feeling while … when you’re bad to the bone
Gotta be the hottest when you shine like chrome
Gotta find that tone, has a mind of its own
Love while I’m sposed to look around and it’s gone
Love while I’m sposed to up hold it down for this crown
Just like her, I’m already gone,
Let the good times go

All I wanna lock, lock, up in this drop top
Pull up in the Chevy so classy and hot, hot, hot
Pockets full and heavy got you screaming what you got got
What you tryna say, I know I already rock, rock
Gotta let go, pedal to the floor
So incredible, so much better with the flow
Ready for the show, …
Do it like a pro, let the good times roll, roll, roll, roll

And let’s go all night, all night
Wake up the club and let’s go all out, all out
More drinks for us, toast for the good times
Where they last forever, we’re youngs, yeah the good times
Raise your glass, let’s all have some fun

Love is nice when it’s understood
Even nicer when it makes you feel good
You got me tripping why our love is old
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll
Come on baby, let the good times roll.

Go hard in my Lambo, strikes and a blizzard
2 million in the frame, gotta roll with the vision
Vision of a good time, all I wanna know

Come on let's go, you got another minute
Get the party on the roll, ain't nothing like the feeling

Stop, stop the show, and stop, stop the flow
The world ain't ready cause I rock the globe

[Lil Wayne]
Hey, Flo I got you!
Yeah yeah!
Take your, take your clothes off
Ride that, I drove off
Highway to heaven I'll burn the bridge
Red bandana, blood, sweat and tears
Yeah, it's Tunechi, Tunechi
With a capital crucifix, hahaha!
Baby let the good times roll like my weed
Sticks on my skateboard, and up my sleeves
YMCMB Truk everything else
So many whips, my garage got whelps
Now put your motherfuckin' hands in the air
And my throne is an electric chair
Yeah!

And let's go all night, all night
Wake up the club and let's go all out, all out
More drinks for us, toast to the good times
May they last forever, we're young, to the good times
Raise your glass, let's all have some fun

Come on baby, let the good times roll... ---

[Chorus:]
Shawty had them Apple Bottom Jeans [Jeans]
Boots with the fur [With the fur]
The whole club was lookin at her
She hit the flo [She hit the flo]
Next thing you know
Shawty got low low low low low low low LOW♪
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reeboks with the straps [With the straps]
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack [Ay]
She hit the floor [She hit the floor]
Next thing you know
Shawty got low low low low low low low low

[Verse 1:]
I ain't never seen nuthin that'll make me go,
This crazy all night spendin my dough
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Dem birthday cakes, they stole the show
So sexual, she was flexible
Professional, drinkin X and ooo
Hold up wait a minute, do I see what I think I
Whoa
Did I think I seen shorty get low
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
Imma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her more
Cash ain't a problem, I know where it goes

She had them

[CHORUS]

[Verse 2:]
Hey
Shawty what I gotta do to get you home
My jeans full of gwap
And they ready for Shones
Cadillacs Maybachs for the sexy groan

Patrone on the rocks that'll make you moan

One stack (come on)
Two stacks (come on)
Three stacks (come on, now that's three grand)
What you think I'm playin baby girl
I'm the man, I'll bend the rubber bands

That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was ova, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a Soldier
She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her
So lucky oo me, I was just like a clover
Shorty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her,
Like a pornography poster
She showed her

[CHORUS]

[Verse 3:]
Whoa
Shawty
Yea she was worth the money
Lil mama took my cash,
And I ain't want it back,
The way she bit that rag,
Got her them paper stacks,
Tattoo Above her crack,
I had to handle that,

I was on it, sexy woman, let me shownin
They be want it two in the mornin
I'm zonin in them rosay bottles foamin
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shorty did that pop and lock,
Had to break her off that gwap
Gah it was fly just like my glock

[CHORUS]

C'mon---Lyrics submitted by deco.

Open up the champagne, pop! 
It's my house, come on, turn it up 

Hear a knock on the door and the night begins 
Cause we done this before so you come on in 
Make yourself at my home, tell me where you been 
Pour yourself something cold, baby, cheers to this 

Sometimes you gotta stay in 
And you know where I live 
Yeah, you know what we is 
Sometimes you gotta stay in, in 

Welcome to my house 
Baby take control now 
We can't even slow down 
We don't like to go out 
Welcome to my house 
Play that music too loud 
Show me what you do now 
We don't like to go out 
Welcome to my house 
Welcome to my house 

Morning comes and you know that you wanna stay 
Close the blinds, let's pretend that the time has changed 
Keep our clothes on the floor, open up champagne 
Let's continue tonight, come on, celebrate 

Welcome to my ... the crib, the spot, the pad 
But my house is your house if you throwin' it back 
Excuse me if my home ... 
Soon as these happy faces ... you can run with the cash 
Homerun, slam dunk, touchdown, pass 
Mi casa es tu casa so it ain't no holding back 
Another shot of vodka, you know what's in my glass 
It's my house, just relax 

Welcome to my house 
It's my house---

Love comes once every now
You and I know your love comes once in a lifetime
Love comes once in a lifetime

She was the neighborhood dream girl
Can look, but don't touch, they all wanna know us
If it ain't with me, then it can't be no one
When the groupies came to the show
When the money started to grow
You stayed down, don't play around
Look at this girl we made now
Been around the world and I came right back for your love
Forgive me for the days and nights I was cutting up
Wanted the motions in the ocean and emotions covered up
From flashing lights in the club to magazine covered up
Fly you to Miami and cop you floor seats
And you would always tell me your heart was for me
Way before the models ripped the runway
It was us, drop-tops, speeding down the runway

So let’s go
I want you to know that you're special
I'll never compare you to no one
Baby, cause I know that your love comes
Once in a lifetime

And she was prom queen, I'm just a new Jack
My city tatted on my back, she had my back, I knew that
But I started looking for more
When they started feeling the flow
Them girls trouble
Come more than a lifetime and time don't wait for no one
I'm out here like I throw ones and they dance for me
My man he warn me how my come-up might just cancel me
Now I gotta go fix that, get that, hit that
He flip that in that like I used to be big D-A-D-D-Y
I'm so special, she can't have another dude that woo her
I got my Bugatti, but that just pickup [?] her
That sears these years on lairs get weird
My fear is tears that smears and make-up
Don't ever make up, you better wake up

I only got one life to live
And I wanna spend it with you
Love the money and the cars, but listen, baby
You are what I’ve been missing---

if you love somebody 
put a light in the air
from the hood to the stakes
fry your finger in the air 
flo rida up in here
wyclef up in here

if i could i would pull it up and rewind 
to the time when it was just me and you
oh how we were inseparable
if i could i'd pull it up and rewind 
to the time before you went away
wish i could go back to yesterday
if i could i'd pull it up and rewind

i try sticking to the rivers that i'm used to 
but these tears got me searching for an inner tube
witness my homies life shorter than my inner lose
don't wanna drown in my hurt cause it's critical
i pop champagne, but stil it's a damn pain
beedee i love you my sister died but it never changed
my last love that we just ditched in my brain
if i could i'd rewind this whole thing

give up the fortune and the fame to hear you say my name
the ghetto rough while the doff try purple rain 
lord knows i wish death never had a name 
our last breath that it never had a relevate
wyclef, flo rida here to tell it man
to the left, move, hurt for suffering
i lose myself when i think about my people's slain

if i could i would pull it up and rewind 
to the time when it was just me and you
oh how we were inseparable
if i could i'd pull it up and rewind
so i sit down and i had try
are you living up in this life?
i know if i could i'd pull it up and rewind

if i could take yesterday and place it in my palms
i anticipate the day like school prom
promise tomorrow what you think till you lose some
big will i know heaven got the futon
face good with the man paid your dues done
wack your shows in japan with me getting drunk
we plans, plans change the new sun

the lord never leave us lonely whenyou lose one
if i could change the past, my people wouldn't past
i wish life was tivo and you could bring it back
i wish it all was remote and how the day be said 
i were ip use it like it's pixel flap
pull up the hood times, pull up the good times
everyday be forever when i'm puttin' down
showing off that's the truth nah

if i could i would pull it up and rewind 
to the time when it was just me and you
oh how we were inseparable 
if i could i'd pull it up and rewind
to the time before you went away 
wish i could go back to yesterday 
if i could i'd pull it up and rewind
so i sit down and i had try
are you living up in the life?
i know if i could i'd pull it up and rewind

if i had the gift be here i'd cure your mom from cancer
take the breena ans stuck em up all with answer
take the crack feen turn her into the prom queen
have her graduate suma ku la day
but she so high that she's riding on drug assist
growing up like the woman from the exorcist
her heart stopped in the ambulance

if i could i would pull it up and rewind 
to th time when it was just me and you
oh how we were inseparable
if i could i'd pull it up and rewind
to the time before you went away
wish i could go back to yesterday
if i could i'd pull it up and rewind
so i sit down and i had try
are you living up in this life?
i know if i could i'd pull it up and rewind---

You spin my head right round, right round
 When you go down, when you go down down

(You spin my head right round, right round)
 (When you go down, when you go down down)

[Verse 1 - Flo Rida]:
 Hey
 Hopped out of that house with my swagger
 Hop in that with girl, I got places to go!
 People to see, time is precious
 I look at my crowd and they out of control
 Just like my mind where Im going
 No women, no shorties, no nothin but clothes
 No stoppin now, my parolees on role
 I like my jewelry, thats always on gold
 I know the storm is comin
 my pockets keep tellin me its gonna shower
 Call up my homies thats home
 Then pop in the night cuz its meant to be ours
 We keep a fade away shot cuz we ballin
 its platinum patron that be ours
 Lil mama, I owe you just like the flowers
 Girl you too drunk with all that and power clubs

[Chorus - Flo Rida (Kesha)]:
 You spin my head right round, right round
 When you go down, when you go down down

(You spin my head right round, right round)
 (When you go down, when you go down down)

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
 She got me throwin my money around
 Aint nothin more beautiful to be found
 Its goin down down
 From the top of the pole I watch her go down
 She got me throwin my money around
 Aint nothin more beautiful to be found
 Its goin down down

[Verse 2 - Flo Rida]:
 Hey
 Shawty must know I'm not playin
 My money love her like a numba one fan
 Dont look at my mouth, let her talk to my fans
 My Benjamin Franklin
 A couple of grands, I got rubber bands
 My paper planes makin a dance
 Get dirty all night, thats part of my thing
 Keep building castles thats made out of sand
 Shes amazing, the fire blazing
 Hotter than Cajun
 Girl wont you move a lil closer
 Time to get paid, its maximum wage
 That body belong on a poster
 Im in a daze, that bottom is wavin at me
 Like damn it I know you
 You wanna show like a gun out of holster
 Tell me whatever and Ill be your roper ..

[Chorus - Flo Rida (Kesha)]:
 You spin my head right round, right round
 When you go down, when you go down down

(You spin my head right round, right round)
 (When you go down, when you go down down)

From the top of the pole I watch her go down
 She got me throwin my money around
 Aint nothin more beautiful to be found
 Its goin down down
 From the top of the pole I watch her go down
 She got me throwin my money around
 Aint nothin more beautiful to be found
 Its goin down down

[Verse 3 - Flo Rida]:
 Im feelin my money
 Im out of control
 Somebody help me
 Shes takin my bank roll
 But Im king of the club
 And Im wearin the crown
 Poppin these bottles
 Touchin these models
 Watchin they asses go down down (down, down...)

You spin my head right round, right round
 When you go down, when you go down down

(You spin my head right round, right round)
 (When you go down, when you go down down)

You spin my head right round, right round
 When you go down, when you go down down

(You spin my head right round, right round)

You might not wanna jog on this one
Get head away for the summer

No sweat, no under armor

Holla back, if you need a spazer

Come around, with a few more karmas

Come here girl, do what I gotta talk rospetta
See me with lil' mama, kinda make you jealous
Yeah be a honor, gotta say you special
Beat her like a drama girl, you better be careful
Comprende, what's a bit late

Calling on you this moment, this instant
What I do is just basic instinct

You see me all over her, you want me all over you
Soon as I get rid of her, tell me what you wanna do

[Chorus]
We're here together
Gonna take it to the next level
Tattoo angels, ain't gotta worry about a thing
You stay wide up ready, rockin' all day
Any time of the evening, you ain't got to worry about a thing
Turn up, you know I got liquor, I keep that drink
Tell me when you ready, tell me when you ready (turn up)
We got pain killers, take the pain away
So tell me when you ready, so tell me when you ready

24 never gonna to sleep till the sun up
Tell me when you ready
We can go all night all day
Baby make the whole day count,
In the club all I see is sparklers
Like birthday candles
Ten models on a regular night

Paid the price for the life
Cause it ain't too much I can't handle
Tell me when you ready got drink for you
Bring a couple of your friends
Got drink for the crew
Got drop for the ladies that love to be ladies
Top floor, we toast on the penthouse roof pop off that
Hour glass breaking so round
I'm so glad that you're ready right now
Oh my God I'mma pop that off
That's just how I feel I'mma be here for a while

[Chorus]
We're here together
Gonna take it to the next level
Tattoo angels, ain't gotta worry about a thing
You stay wide up ready, rockin' all day
Any time of the evening, you ain't got to worry about a thing
Turn up, you know I got liquor, I keep that drink
Tell me when you ready, tell me when you ready (turn up)
We got pain killers, take the pain away
So tell me when you ready, so tell me when you ready

Can't hold your cup cause your cup so full
Chase that vodka with a little Red Bull
Pulling up late nights to the back of the club
Baby girl, you know I got pull
I ain't gonna mind if you got twerking
No moaning and try to take it from anything that you deserve
I promise you're ready for that night life, get the night light

Cause it feel right
Baby, ain't no drama, work that body baby,
Sweat that summer, we can do it all night girl, no problem
Fly high, get high, make your money
All you gotta do is say don't worry
I'mma give it all to you, so momma baby ain't no problem
Let's get to that number

[Chorus]
We're here together
Gonna take it to the next level
Tattoo angels, ain't gotta worry about a thing
You stay wide up ready, rockin' all day
Any time of the evening, you ain't got to worry about a thing
Turn up, you know I got liquor, I keep that drink
Tell me when you ready, tell me when you ready (turn up)
We got pain killers, take the pain away
So tell me when you ready, so tell me when you ready ---

I said hey, that's what I like, I like about you!
The way you do what you do, how you do, I like about you!
Come on now, hey, that's what I like, I like about you!
The way you do what you do, how you do, I like about you!
I said hey, hey, hey, hey!

They call me Ali Bomaye, M.I.A. to ..., baby

And how much fun can one man take?
You walk past and I go crazy
Oh my, my, my, my
Like it, like it, checkmate yeah

Come on let's get it started
My party, you got in

Give me one for the treble, I need two for the bass

Throw it back like it's ..., I work the play

Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow
You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Here we go

I'm betting you like people
And I'm betting you love creep mode
And I'm betting you like girls that give love to girls
And stroke your little ego
I bet I'm guilty your honor
But that's how we live in my genre
When in hell I pay rottweiler
There's only one flo, and one rida
I'm a damn shame
Order more champagne, pulled a damn hamstring 
Tryna put it on ya
Bet your lips spin back around corner
Slow it down baby take a little longer

Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow
You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Here we go

Whistle baby, whistle baby,
Whistle baby, whistle baby

It's like everywhere I go
My whistle ready to blow
Shorty don't leave a note
She can get any by the low
Permission not approved
It's okay, it's under control
Show me soprano, cause girl you can handle
Baby we start snagging, you come in part clothes
Girl I'm losing wing, my bucatti the same road
Show me your perfect pitch,
You got it my banjo
Talented with your lips, like you blew out candles
So amusing, now you can make a whistle with the music
Hope you ain't got no issue, you can do it
Give me the perfect picture, never lose it

Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow
You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Here we go

Whistle baby, whistle baby,
Whistle baby, whistle baby

Go girl you can twerk it
Let me see your whistle while you work it
I'mma lay it back, don't stop it
Cause I love it how you drop it, drop it, drop it, on me
Now, shorty let that whistle blow
Yeah, baby let that whistle blow

Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow
You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Here we go

Whistle baby, whistle baby,
Whistle baby, whistle baby---Lyrics submitted by Sadia Quazi.

[Sia - Hook]
Hey I heard you were a wild one
Oooh
If I took you home
It'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do

I want to shut down the club
With you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones
Oooh

[Flo Rida]
I like crazy, foolish, stupid
Party going wild, fist pumping
Music, I might lose it
Blast to the roof, that's how we do'z it
I don't care the night, she don't care we like
Almost dared the right five
Ready to get popping, ain't no surprise
Take me so high, jumping no doubts
Surfing the crowd
Oooh
Said I gotta be the man
When they heading my van, might check one too
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it, and y'all get lose lose
After bottle, we all get bit and again tomorrow
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto
Club shuts down, I heard you're super models

[Sia - Hook]
Hey I heard you were a wild one
Oooh
If I took you home
It'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do

I want shut down the club
With you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones
Oooh

[Flo Rida]
Party rocker, foot show stopper
More shampoo
Never one, club popper
Got a hangover like too much vodka
Can't see me with ten binoculars
So cool
No doubt by the end of the night
Got the clothes coming off
Til I make that move
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof
All black shades when the sun come through
Oh, it's on like everything goes
Round up baby til the freaky show
What happens to that body, it's a private show
Stays right here, private show
I like em untamed, don't tell me how pain
Tell them this, bottoms up with the champagne
My life, coming harder than we hit play
Do you busy with the bail, were you insane

[Sia - Hook]
Hey I heard you were a wild one
Oooh
If I took you home
It'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do

I want to shut down the club
With you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones
Oooh

[Bridge]
I am a wild one
Break me in
Saddle me up and lets begin
I am a wild one
Tame me now
Running with wolves
And i'm on the prowl

Show you another side of me
A side you would never thought you would see
Tell that body
Gotta make sure do you have enough
I can't lie
The wilds don't lie

[Sia - Hook]
Hey I heard you were a wild one
Oooh
If I took you home
It'd be a home run
Show me how you'll do

I want to shut down the club
With you
Hey I heard you like the wild ones
Oooh

I am a wild one
Break me in
Saddle me up and let's begin
I am a wild one
Tame me now
Running with wolves
And i'm on the prowl---Lyrics submitted by HardfireWolf.

Every time you come around
I'm like ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby
When I see you break it down
I like you do, baby, you do, baby
Papa told me, "Boy
Don't ever let down your guard"
But when you touch my hand and talk that talk
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk

Wobble in my... wobble in my...
Wobble in my... wobble in my...
When you touch my hand and talk that talk
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk

It's like my head's back, been drinkin' out the bottle, I swallow
Some strong drank but really just my motto, she lotto
Jackpot, grand prize, champion franchise
Born ready and she get it right there on time
Early A.M., breakfast after the mayhem
Baby cause they don't make them like you, I hope that you hate them
Black [?], I keep 'em twerkin'
They're workin', that's why they're perfect, go 'head and purchase

Girl it's on me, yeah it's my dime
Damn if I'm wrong, yeah it's alright
When you go down, down in my mind
Do what you want, that's what I like

Every time you come around
I'm like ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby
When I see you break it down
Like you do, baby, you do, baby
Papa told me, "Boy
Don't ever let down your guard"
But when you touch my hand and talk that talk
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk

Wobble, wobble, satisfaction, my model
Show me you'll lead the way, and maybe I'll follow
Promise you ecstasy, long as you're here with me
No promise at all, my love be guaranteed
Cause baby I'll hit the throttle, make our way to the grotto
Private dancin' in there and Playboy mansion tomorrow
It's all free, cause I agree you make 'em weak
Talkin' 'bout my knees, and the thing you need, girl

Girl it's on me, yeah it's my dime
Damn if I'm wrong, yeah it's alright
When you go down, down in my mind
Do what you want, that's what I like

Every time you come around
I'm like ooh ooh baby, ooh ooh baby
When I see you break it down
Like you do, baby, you do, baby
Papa told me, "Boy
Don't ever let down your guard"
But when you touch my hand and talk that talk
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk

Work, work, work, work, work with it
Don't stop, don't, don't stop, get it
When you touch my hand and talk that talk
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk

Wobble in my... wobble in my...
Wobble in my... wobble in my...
When you touch my hand and talk that talk
I got a knockin' in my knees and a wobble in my walk---
