The way I feel sometimes its too hard to sit still
Things are so passionate times are so real
Sometimes I try an chill mellow down blowin smoke
Smile on my face but its really no joke
You feel it in the streets people breathe without hope
They goin through the motion, they dimmin down they focus
The focus gettin clear and the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly sometimes ya don't hear me
I push it past the bass no nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones, black, I'm so wide awake
That I hardly ever sleep, my flows forever deep
And its volumes or scriptures when I breath on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
I'm every where penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave tall lead you onna shell
Universal ghetto life holla black you know it well

Quiet storm vital form pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force, high level right across
Shoulders the lions raw voice is the siren
I swing round ring out and bring down the tyrant
Shocked a small act could knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous there's no need for fightin
Suttins tryna hide like the struggle wont find em
And the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him
Everywhere penthouse pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave talk'll lead you on a shell
Universal ghetto life holla black you know it well

What it is
You know they know
What it is
We know yall know
What is is
Ecstatic there it is
Huh

[2X]
What it is
You know we know
What it is
They know yall know
What it is
You don't know? here it is
[2X]

(and always on time and rockin ya mind)
Sit and come relax riddle of the mac, its the patch
I'm a soldier in the middle of Iraq
Well say about noonish commin out the whip
And lookin at me curious, a young Iraqi kid (awww)
Carrying laundry, "whats wrong G? hungry?"
No, gimme my oil get- fuck out my country
And in Arabian barkin other stuff
Till his moms come grab him and they walk off in a rush

Distrust, feelin like I pissed upon wounds
I'm like surely hope that we can fix our differences soon (bye!)
Buyin apples, I'm breakin on
"You take everything why not just take the damn food" (black bastard)
I don't understand it, on another planet?
51 of this stuff how I'm gunna manage?
And increasingly sentiment gentlemen
Gettin down on their middle eastern instruments
Realized trappin is crap
Walk over kicked one of my fabulous raps (la dee da dee)
Arab jaw drop, they well wished they glad wrapped
Now the kid considered like an Elvis of Baghdad---Lyrics submitted by Jordan.

[mos def] 
Lawwwwd, lawd have mercy 
All nice and peace and true, follow me now, we say 
Say hi-tek yes you're ruling hip-hop 
Say j. rawls yes you're ruling hip-hop 
Redefinition say you're ruling hip-hop 
Say black star come to rock it non... 

Yo, from the first to the last of it, delivery is passionate 
The whole and not the half of it, vocab and not the math of it 
Projectile that them blasted with, accurate assassin shit 
Me and kweli close like, bethlehem and nazareth 
After this you be pressing rewind on top your master disk 
Shining like an asterisk for all those that be gatherin 
Connectin like a roundhouse from the townhouse to the tenaments 
Cause all my brooklyn residents, ? heavy regiments 
Don't believe, here the evidence, where brooklyn whaaaaaaaoohhhh 
See that? bound to take it all kid, believe that 
From where they sellin tree at, to where the police be at 
Talib kweli e-kweli-ty yo tell them where we be at 

[talib kweli] 
Brooklyn new york city where they paint murals of biggie 
In cash we trust cause it's ghetto fabulous, life look pretty 
What a pity -- blunts is still fifty cents, it's intense 
Tree scents is dominant can't be covered with incense 
My presence felt my name is kweli from the eternal reflection 
People thinkin mc is short hand for mis conception 
Let me meditate, set it straight, came to the conclusion 
That most of these cats is featherweight, let me demonstrate 
Walkin the streets is like battlin, be careful with your body 
You must know karate or think your soul is bulletproof like sade 
Stop actin like a bitch already, be a visionary 
And maybe you can see your name in the column of obituary 
Third rate teacher readin and talkin about, 
"i knew he'd amount to nothin" 
Neighbors like, "he was the quiet type, 
Who'd have thought they was frontin? " 
Talkin +loud+ like you in rca, get carted away 
With body parts and treys, what a way to start your day 
Yo it's like 

Chorus: mos def and talib kweli 

One two three 
Mos def and talib kweli 
We came to rock it on to the tip-top 
Best alliance in hip-hop, wyahhhhh 
I said one two three 
It's kind of dangerous to be a emcee 
They shot tupac and biggie 
Too much violence in hip-hop, wyahhhhh 

[mos def] 
I said manhattan keep on makin it (bo!), brooklyn keep on takin it (bo!) 
So relax we're takin it back, redhook where we're livin at 
Plenty cats be strugglin not hustlin and bubblin 
It ain't about production and -- what else we discussin? 
When the cock crows, my crop grows, enable me to rock flows 
Strivin for perfection ever since I was a snot-nosed 
Colossal, true original b-boy apostle 
Standin on the rooftop with the, zulu gestapo 

[talib kweli] 
You think you the shit 
Somebody in the wings'll force you to quit 
It could be your crew or click 
Or some random kid you smoked buddha with 
Consider me the entity within the industry without a history 
Of spittin the epitome, of stupidity -- livin my life 
Expressin my liberty, it gotta be done properly 
My name is in the middle of e-kweli-ty 
People follow me and other cats they hear him flow 
And assume I'm the real one with lyrics like I'm cyrano 

[mos def] 
Still sippin wishin well water, imported, from pluto 
Three hundred and sixty milliliters for all our believers 
In miles or kilometers, most cats, cannot proceed us 
In the jungle with the leaders we the lions you the +cheaters+ 
A cypher, will complete us if we come through your receivers 
You can play us and repeat us and then take us home and read us 
(line for line) good jesus, mos def and kweli just 
Make a pussy freeze up, thinkin we will ease up 

Chorus---Lyrics submitted by Rachel.

No Hay Nada Mas

Bueno, Flac,
Llámame Flac pero mi primer nombre es Jacin Andante
El apellido el pay 

Oiga
Eso soy testigo
La hermosa, el peligro distinto claro que si la verdad
La calle, el pueblo
Las fincas y centros

Ciudad calidad no mejor, mala mas
Guerra y vida, amor y cambio
Comida la guarda 
Pistola, oración para ellos,
Damas y caballeros
Familia, crianza
La luz en la distancia

Quiero y lo dijo
Bien es mas cercana 
Mi vista, mi casa, mis sueños, mi alma
Quiero saber lo sentí tu abrazo 
Y tu contacto 
Pues a mi algo
Claro
Amen

Claro, claro, claro que si
No hay nada mas
No hay nada mas
Final
No hay nada mas
Claro, claro, claro que si
No hay nada mas
Y no hay nada mas
Final
No hay nada mas
Claro, claro, claro que si.


English Translation
There Is Nothing Else

Good one, thin
Call me thin, but my first name is Jaci Andante (the one who walks)
The last name the one who pays

Listen
That I am witness
The beauty, the danger is different, of course it is the truth
The street, the town
The cottages and centers

City quality no better, worse
War and life, love and change
Food that is being kept
Pistol, this prayer is for them
Women and men
Family, upbringing
The light in the distance

I want and say
Good is closer
My sight, my house, my dreams, my soul
I want to know and feel your embrace
And your contact
Show me something
Amen

Of course, of course, of course, yes
There is nothing else
There is nothing else
The end
There is nothing else
Of course, of course, of course, yes
There is nothing else
And there is nothing else
The end
There is nothing else
Of course, of course, of course, yes---Lyrics submitted by Kiandra.

You are the one
You're the ooooone!

Other brothers just don't know
You got to feel me on this one man
So real
I'm so sin-serious about it, you know?
I know, I know more than a few is gonna relate
So much more than a few (fa-really real)
So much more (on the really real!)

When it started I knew it was trouble
But you know me
Them "hard an'
e'rythings" can't hold me
(you love, hardhead)
I need some shit straight out the movies
DRAMA
Warm to the touch, hot mama
You put me all in like launch jeans and scama
You was Mrs. Mine
So fine
Went from "we gonna conquer it all"
To "nigga I'ma see you in court"
I woulda never thought (damn)
I guess I better think again (you know?)
OK, now the shit is really sinking in
We ain't just divorced
We ain't even fucking friends
Cause in the end it was all about the ends

But fuck that I know it gotta be more to it
Held up with bitter hate with
crosses all through it
And when I looked, what did I see?
You on the other end crying like me
Expression on your face like,
"how could this be?"
That's what I'm asking, "what
the fuck happened?"
How could all the magic and
passion just vanish (c'mon)
Went from outsanding, to makin' me
shout, "Dammit!"
Can't explain the changes,
behavior's is outlandish
Now I'm just stuck in the road feeling stranded
I'm in the dark wishing for the answers
On some ol' "Biggie gimme one
more chance" shit

When we met your face so brown
Ya ass so round, of course I'm so down
Wish I knew then what the fuck I know now
Couldn't read the signs in the
road: "SLOW DOWN!"
I'm too deep in the road now
Got me pulling over getting smoked out
Fighting tears that I can't hold down
Can't believe it, this fucka's got me weeping
I keep it a secret so my friends
won't peep it (live man?)
But late in the evening I'm up, my chest heaving
I'm reaching in the dark and I'm
looking for the reason
(WHY!)
Did our love have to die?
You and I were so fucking fly
Can't get it off my mind
The things that made me smile now make me cry

You are the one
You're the one!
FUCK YOU!!

I wish we never met, I wish we never kissed
I wish we never touched (I swear to God)
I wish I didn't love you so much
I wish I could forget how feel, how you f--
(Damn) That's a lie
The shit that made me smile, now make me cry

You are the one
You're the one!
FUCK YOU!!

Sometime I wish we'd come back
Man, I wish we'd come back
(Memories!)--No lie
For real?
Fuck that

No, for real
It's a dangerous necessity, it's
a world famous mystery
Love

That's it
Peace!---Lyrics submitted by Ruben.

And the world wanna dance
Fly like a dove

But you can't call it weak
And you can't call it chump
And looking like that
Babe you need to call me up

These jokers don't want none
And all the pretty mommies want some
Tell 'em come

Dispirit and raw till they can't get enough
Haters get it twisted
