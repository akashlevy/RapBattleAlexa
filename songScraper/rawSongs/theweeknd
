Baby you're no good
Cause they warned me bout your type girl
I've been ducking left and right
Baby you're no good
Think I fell for you, I fell for you, I fell for you

You got me puttin' time in, time in
Nobody got me feeling this way
You probably think I'm lying, lying
I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way

You got me touchin' on your body
You got me touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted
I get you touchin' on your body
I get you touchin' on your body
I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted

Baby you're no good
All my niggas think I'm crazy cause I'm thinkin' 'bout us lately
But really if I could
I'd forget about you, 'get about you, 'get about you

You got me puttin' time in, time in
Nobody got me feeling this way
You probably think I'm lying, lying
I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way

You got me touchin' on your body
You got me touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted
I got you touchin' on your body
I got you touchin' on your body
I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted, we're acquainted

Momma called me cryin', cryin', cryin', cryin'
I won't find somebody that's real (she wants somebody that's real)
Cause every time I try to, try to, try to run
The fast life keeps gaining on me, shit
But ever since I met you
I couldn't believe what you did
So comfort me babe, ain't no rush from me babe

I'll keep on touchin' on your body
I'll keep on touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted
I got you touchin' on your body
I got you touchin' on your body
I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted, we're acquainted

I'm not trying to talk at all
Cause I'm trying to love you crazy
Put some more inside your cup
And drink till you numb the pain
I got you touchin' on your body
These girls keep touchin' on their body
They got accustomed to the life we live
These girls born in the '90s are dangerous
I got 'em thinkin' that they want me
Although they know they not the only
I got 'em wanting to embrace their sins
These girls born in the '90s are dangerous---

You loved me for all the wrong reasons
There's nothing but pain left gere I know
What's killing me is that I'm killing you

Three years of torment and torturous love
Stained with tears and mistrust,
Enough is enough
I can't hold you any longer in this hell I'm in
Cause your heart is to weak for me to break it again
All the mistakes that I've made...
You forgave, what the fuck ? You shouldn't have stayed
You'd always said "there's so much love in you"
I can't believe that you can't see that

You loved me for all the wrong reasons
I'm not the same I used to be
There's nothing but pain left gere I know
What's killing me is that I'm killing you

Do you remember the beginning ? Heartbeats one and the same ?
Living smitten in Texas
Burning bright as a flame
So young and in love, no care what anyone said
'Til my soul grew cold and my heart turn dead
What went so wrong with me ?
Why did I break this ?
Why was I so blind and fucking dumb to see
That we were perfect 'til I turned around and gave in to debauchery
This is your chance to escape this, my goodbye with a last kiss
Yeaaah !
'Cause I know deep down you know that

You loved me for all the wrong reasons
I'm not the same as I used to be
There's nothing but pain left gere I know
What's killing me is that I'm killing you

You loved me for all the wrong reasons
I'm not the same as I used to be
There's nothing but pain left gere I know
What's killing me is that I'm killing you ---

And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, (yeah) this I know

She told me, "Don't worry about it"
She told me, "Don't worry no more"
We both knew we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love oh oh oooh

I can't feel my face when I'm with you, but I love it, but I love it
I can't feel my face when I'm with you, but I love it, but I love it

And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
This I know, yes I know, and I know

She told me, "Don't worry about it"
She told me, "Don't worry no more"
We both knew we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love oh oh oooh

I can't feel my face when I'm with you, but I love it, but I love it
I can't feel my face when I'm with you, but I love it, but I love it

She told me, "Don't worry about it"
She told me, "Don't worry no more"
We both knew we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be in love oh oh oooh

I can't feel my face when I'm with you, but I love it, but I love it
I can't feel my face when I'm with you, but I love it, but I love it---

You’ll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won’t you please let me be
I’ve been here times before
But I was to blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won’t seduce me

She’s saying that’s ok
Hey baby do what you please
I have the stuff the you want
I am the thing that you need
She looked me deep in the eyes
She’s touchin’ me so to start
She says there’s no turnin’ back
She trapped me in her heart

[Hook]
Dirty Diana, No
Dirty Diana, No
Dirty Diana, No
Dirty Diana
Let Me Be!

Oh No ...
Oh No ...
Oh No ...

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician’s fan after the curtains comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that’s so carefree

She’s says that’s ok
Hey baby do what you want
I’ll be your night lovin’ thing
I’ll be the freak you can taunt
And I don’t care what you say
I want to go too far
I’ll be your everything
If you make me a star

[Hook]
Dirty Diana, oh
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, ooh
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, nooo
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no no
Dirty Diana
Let me be…

She said I have to go home
Cause I’m real tired you see
But I hate sleepin’ alone
Why don’t you come with me
I said my baby’s at home
She’s probably worried tonight
I didn’t call on the phone to
Say that I’m alright

Diana walked up to me
She said I’m all yours tonight
At that I ran to the phone
Sayin’ baby I’m alright
I said unlock the door
Because I forgot the key
She said he’s not coming back
Because he’s slepping with me

Dirty Diana, oh
Dirty Diana, oh

It won't be in vain
To swallow what hurts
And learn to love what burn
And gather courage to return

Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night

The light will shine through the rain
And heaven will hear them call your name
And home will feel like home again
Corruption will fill your brain

[x2]
Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night

They will parade upon your victory
They will parade upon your victory
You'll put a smile upon their faces
The world will be yours for the taking
The story you birth will be ageless
Just learn to love pain and be patient

Faces in the crowd
Faces in the crowd will smile again
And the devil may cry
The devil may cry at the end of the night---

You make it look like it’s magic 
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you

'Cause girl you're perfect

And you deserve it

You know our love would be tragic 
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind 
We live with no lies 
Hey, hey 
You're my favorite kind of night 

On that lonely night 
We said it wouldn't be love 
But we felt the rush 
It made us believe it was only us 
Convinced we were broken inside, inside---

Talk to me baby
Tell me what you're feeling
You say you don't need to go
Don't you pretend you didn't know

How all of this would end up
Girl I saw it in your eyes
And baby I can read your mind
And expectations were not in sight

You knew that talking dirty to me on the phone would get me here
Cause we both wanted to do this but I could tell that you were scared
Cause you thought there was more to us but you knew how this would end
It's gonna end how you expected girl you're such a masochist and I ask why

And you reply... I like the thrill
Nothing's gonna make me feel this real
So baby don't go home
I don't wanna spend tonight alone

Baby please
Would you end your night with me
Don't you leave me all behind
Don't you leave my little life

No no no no no ---Lyrics submitted by Tina Marie Landry.

I hope I make it home
You'll be thinking of it
I got the whole city on my side, tonight, tonight
Watch us rock it out
Watch us leave the ground
After the show is done
You can take me to yours

But my lungs so muddy
I love the way it tastes
Drink it till I'm ugly baby
Fuck me while I'm faded
Feel that through my denims
Baby girl I gotcha
I'm only 21 so I do it when I wanna
Gone from the codeine, 'methazine, lean
Got me feelin' kinda weak
And it's kinda hard to breathe
But you're turning 23, so I'll fuck you if you need
In your birthday suit
I'mma give you what you fiend

But I ain't taking off my black boots
I'm fallin'
Cuz I'm numb from the neck down
I'm sorry
You won't know that I can't feel it
I can win a fuckin' Oscar
By the way I fuckin' hid it
And you won't ever fuckin know
Cuz I'll never fuckin' show it
Except when I be wheezy from another cup of potion

Dirty Sprite toastin'
Fast life fuck slow
Low life for life
Let the meds flow
Let the night flow
I'm so gone
Let these meds flow

Woah, woah, oh

You don't know what's in store
But you know what you're here for
Close your eyes
Lay yourself beside me
Hold tight for this ride
We don't need no protection
Come alone
We don't need attention

Open your hand
Take a glass
Don't be scared
I'm right here
Even though you don't roll
Trust me girl
You wanna be high for this

Take it off
You want it off
'Cause I know what you're feeling
It's okay girl I feel it too
Let it be baby breathe
I swear I am right here
We'll be good I promise
We'll be so good

Open your hand
Take a glass
Don't be scared

Even though you don't roll
Trust me girl
You wanna be high for this
You wanna be high for this

All alone she was living
In a world without an end or beginning
Baby girl was living life for the feeling
But I don't mind, I don't mind
And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so co-dependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I don't mind, I don't mind

And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone

In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)

He sang a song when he did it
He was cold and he was so unforgiving
Now she dances to the song on the minute
Yeah, all the time, all the time
It make her weak when she hear it
And it got her on her knees like religion
She was young and she was forced to be a woman
Yeah, all the time, all the time

And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone

In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)

I don't think you understand

In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)
In the night when she comes crawling
Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)---

Oh yeah
Got you drinking out them white cups, sodas
All this shit sounds foreign to you, thick smoke, choking
Baby get familiar with the order
Just crack it, then pour it, then sip slow, then tip low
My eyes red but my brim low, that XO, she climbing
Straight to the top, forget why she there in the first place
No more crying, heart rate's low, put that rum down you don't wanna die tonight
I promise, when you’re finished we’ll head to where I’m living
The party won’t finish it’s a fucking celebration

For my niggas out tonight, and they high off Shakespeare lines
There's enough to pass around, you ain't gotta wait in line
And the clocks don't work you ain't gotta check the time
And the blinds don't work you ain't gotta check the sky
We be going all night, til light

I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys

You've been going hard baby, now you rolling with some big boys baby
Got a lot you wanna show off baby, close that door before you take your fucking clothes off baby
Don't mind, all my writings on the wall
Thought I passed my peak, and I'll experience some fall
And all I wanna do is leave cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, trying to concentrate to breathe
Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, got me gum chewing
Call one of your best friends
Baby if you mixing up
Cup of that XO, baby I been leaning
Back from the come down, girl I been fiending
For another round, don't you blame it on me
When you're grinding up them teeth and it's fucking hard to sleep

I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby come over here and ride it out, ride it out

Work that back til I tire out
Roll that weed, blow the fire out
Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
Get so wet when I eat you out
Girlfriend screaming that I'm creeping out
If they're not down, better keep em out
Ex-man hollering, keep him out
Hard to let go, I could teach you how
Take a puff of this motherfucking weed for now
Take a shot of this cognac, ease you out
Just one night, trying to fucking leave you out
Baby, baby

I got a test for you
You say you want my heart
Well baby you can have it all
There's just something I need from you
Is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby come over here and ride it out, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Baby come over here and ride it out, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah

It seems like fear and regret are your best friends
Cause everything you do leads to them right, right
Well baby I can be your best friend
And baby I can fuck you right

Baby you can have it all

Baby you can have the cars, the clothes, the drugs, the sex, the house
Baby you can be a Star (x2)

Well blame it on your sins and your best friends
And nothing's never ever your fault
Nothing's your fault baby
Well baby you don't need no best friends

It's like a kiss was laced.
Imma feen, imma feen, imma feen.

Love to tease and play,
But girl I need to be direct with you.

That I wanna spend my cash on.

End of Song---Lyrics submitted by Kyle.

I usually love sleeping all alone
This time around bring your friend with you
But we ain't really going to sleep at all
You ain't gonna catch me with them sneak pictures
In my city I'm a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious
My god white, he in my pocket
Get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous

Ask me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Ask how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often

Infatuated by the fame status
She wanna ride inside the G-Class Grain, matted
I come around, she leave that nigga like he ain't matter
That girl been drinkin' all day, need to change bladder
She's just happy that the crew's back in town
She's 'bout to go downtown for a whole hour
If I had her, you can have her, man it don't matter
I'm never sour, I'm just smokin' somethin' much louder

Ask me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Ask how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often

Oooh, the sun's risin' up
The night's almost up
The night's almost done
But I see your eyes
You wanna go again
Girl, I'll go again
Girl, I'll go again

Ask me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Ask how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy poppin', do it how I want it
Often---

[Verse 1]
I’ll let you show me his moves
Let you do what he taught you
Let you reminisce how you used to do
Girl I’m open to anything that’ll get you into that zone
And understand that we’re all alone
So you can slowly take off your clothes
Baby girl you know what’s in store
Baby I will stay up all night
And I’ve been goin’ hard since last night
And I’mma go harder tonight
Wish you can see you through my eyes
Ooh I’m tellin’ you this ain’t the same
And I know he’s still in your brain
I’m ‘bout to burn that shit into flames
Once I’m in you
Baby

[Hook]
Forget what you know
Make yourself at home
‘Cuz baby when I’m finished with ya you won’t wanna go
Outside

[Verse 2]
And I’mma work you like a pro, baby
And, you gon’ take it like one
Yeah you gon’ take it like one
And I’mma give it like you asked for it
Why, cuz you been talkin’ ’bout it
I know you been talkin’ ’bout it
Ooh baby when I’m done with you, why
You ain’t sayin nothin’
Yeah you ain’t sayin nothin’
Ooh baby when I’m done with you, why
You ain’t sayin nothin’
Yeh you ain’t sayin nothin’
You gon’ make me show off
All the pain that you feel you can tell that we ain’t makin no love
But I’ll pretend
Oh girl, I’ll pretend
If you pretend then girl I’ll pretend
Let’s make it seem like we’re all we need in the end

[Hook]
Forget what you know
Make yourself at home
‘Cuz baby when I’m finished with ya you won’t wanna go

I understand your body wants it
I know your thoughts
Oh you 'bout it, 'bout it
You're a big girl and it's your world
And I'ma let you do it how you wanna
Girl alright baby, right baby
I know you know I know you wanna... with it
Don't be shy pretty, I'll supply pretty
I got you girl, oh I got it girl

With your Louis V bag
Tatts on your arms
High-heel shoes make you six feet tall
Everybody wants you, you can have them all
But I got what you need
Girl I got your bag, I got it all
Hold your drink baby don't you fall
Be there in a minute baby just one call
You don't gotta ask me

You always come to the party
To pluck the feathers off all the birds
You always come to the party
On your knees
I will not beg you please

Girl, pick up them shoes
I'll race your ass up on them stairs
Just grab a room I swear no one will interfere
Girl bring your friends if you want, we can share
Or we could keep it simple, baby
We can just ride baby, ride baby
I know you know I know you wanna... with it
Don't be shy baby, I'll supply baby
I got you girl, oh I got it girl

With your Louis V bag
Tatts on your arms
High-heel shoes make you six feet tall
Everybody wants you, you can have them all
But I got what you need
Girl I got your bag, I got it all
Hold your drink baby don't you fall
Be there in a minute baby just one call
You don't gotta ask me

You always come to the party
To pluck the feathers of all the birds
You always come to the party
On your knees
I will not beg you please
I will not...

Ride with it, ride with it
I know, you know, I know you wanna line with it
Don't be shy pretty, I'll supply pretty
I got you girl, oh I got it girl

Won't you lie with it, lie with it
I know you know I know you wanna...
I got you girl, oh I got you girl

Oh I got it girl, oh I got it girl
I think I'm fucking gone
Rolling on this floor
Messing up your carpet
I'll get on it after four
My sessions are the strong on your floor
Shouldn't have fucking rolled
But I fucking rolled
Feeling like a million bucks before
I walk through the store
When I walk through your door
Can't believe I made it but I made it that's for sure
For sure, loving I need more, I need yours
She ain't looking for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on
They want what I'm sittin' on
They don't want my love
They just want my potential
Fuck it though, sippin' on this
Baby livin' off bliss got me drowning in your love
Got me drowning in the mist
Gimme my attention or I'll start drowning from my wrist

Baby if you knew the feeling I would give to you
Oh you
You, oh you
'Cause I got it girl, oh I got it girl
With me, with me
Oh you, oh you
Oh you, oh you
Oh I got it girl, oh I got it girl
With me, with me

I got a brand new girl call it Rudolph
She'll probably OD before I show her to mama
All these girls tryna tell me she got no love
And all these girls never ever got her blow job
Ringtone on silent
And if she stops then I might get violent
No calls worth stopping
So mama please stop calling
We could play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fucking prove this feeling I'ma give to you
Oh you, you
Oh you, Oh I got it girl, oh I got it girl
With me, with me
Oh you, oh you
Oh you, oh you
Oh I got it girl, oh I got it girl
With me, with me

Oh I got it girl---Lyrics submitted by Christine.

[Verse 1:]
Where were you when I needed you, eight months ago
All your girlfriends talkin' bout me, now you ringin' up my phone
Bet you miss me now baby, bet you'd kiss me now baby
Especially since you know that this ain't nothin' and I only just begun

[Bridge]
You never thought that I would ever go this far
You said potential could never last this long
Well baby I've been alone for almost all my life
What makes you think that you could ever do me right

[Hook]
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
You're the same old song
The same old song

[Verse 2:]
And now I'm poppin' yea
Ain't nobody showed me how
I made it big poppin' yeah
Tell me how you like me now
I swear I loved you girl
And you probably went and fucked the world
Well you can take another shot everytime you hear me playin' in the club

[Bridge]
You never thought that I would ever go this far
(never thought I'd go this far I made it)
You said potential could never last this long
(you never thought it could last so long)
Well baby I've been alone for almost all my life
(I been alone for most of my life)
What makes that you think you could ever do me right

[Hook]---Lyrics submitted by renee robinson.

Can’t you see?
It won’t mean a thing to me
I’ve been doing this too long
Baby girl, I’ve felt it all
So watch out
If you try to play your luck
Ain’t nobody gonna care enough
To catch you fall

[Hook]
So don’t you fall in love
Don’t make me make you fall in love
Don’t make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Nobody needs to fall in love
I swear I’m just a bird
Girl, I’m just another bird
Don’t make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like Me

You tried
You tried to warn me
But baby, I’m warning you
Girl, i’ll show you
This is no game
You’ll be falling to the point of no return
No return

[Hook]

I know you’re rolling hard with it, don’t lie
I know it’s got a hold of you
I know you’re rolling with it
Baby don’t you lie
Baby

I know you’re rolling hard with it, don’t lie
I know it’s got a hold of you
I know you’re rolling with it
Baby don’t you lie

Don’t make me make you fall in love
Don’t make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me

Your man on the road, he doing promo
You said keep our business on the low-low
I'm just tryna get you out the friend-zone
Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Driving through the gated residential
Found out I was coming, sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

I only call you when it's half past, five
The only time that I'll be by, your, side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past, five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up, don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
You gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs start to feel like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

I only call you when it's half past, five
The only time that I'll be by, your, side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past, five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl hide your lies
Who are you to trust, who are you?

I only call you when it's half past, five
The only time that I'll be by, your, side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past, five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

You did many things that I liked, that I liked
And you like diamond rings
I can provide, I can provide for you
You made me feel so good
Before I left on the road
And you deserve your name on a crown, on a throne
[x2]

I haven't been around the town in a long while
I apologize but I
I've been trying to get this money like I got a couple kids who rely on me
I remember on the bathroom floor
Before I went on tour
When you said we couldn't do it again
Cause you had a thing with some other man
You said it was love
And you said you were lost
Then you wished me good luck
To find somebody to love
But, ooh
Now I've heard that you're single
And oh, I'll give you something to live for
Yes, I would

Honey please
You never thought you'd ever see my face again
But your love just swayed the lies
When he stared into your eyes
He just might be too good for you
You're almost dead to him
You're sleeping with a frozen heart
Well baby girl it's over now
And you can always count on me
Your unshackled bind, unrestrainted touch
So immune to love
And it feels so priceless to me
That you're always free
That you'll take me in
Now, I'm everything, your everything
I bet you'll take me in
I know you'll take me in now
The same place I left you in
I bet you'll take me in
I know you'll take me in, I know you'll take me in
The same place I left you in

You did many things that I liked, that I liked
And you like diamond rings
I can provide, I can provide for you
You made me feel so good
Before I left on the road
And you deserve your name on a crown, on a throne ---

I tell myself that I'll take you for the last time
I'll be over you eventually
Time after time, you seem to push me off
I understand what we have become
You wash your neck when you leave, now I know your routine
I was in love with your mystery
Now I just take what I can get from you
I'm not embarrassed to be what you want me to be

Cause unlike you I got nothing to hide
I don't pretend to have any shame
I got a box we could put all your lies in
Until the end of days
You know that I will be a call away
The call you make when you're all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done

Well here comes the sun
And you're in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you'll stay through the night

You just wanna fill the void now
I can tell that you've been yelling at him all night long
And I can hear it in your voice now
He got you smoking extra packs a day
Don't you worry 'bout me talking
I know why you've been coming
I'll be quiet, this ain't nothing to me
Just wrap your legs around my waist
I won't stop until you ask me
Don't you worry 'bout us messing up my sheets

Cause unlike you I got nothing to hide
I don't pretend to have any shame
I got a box we could put all your lies in
Until the end of days
You know that I will be a call away
The call you make when you're all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done

Well here comes the sun
And you're in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you'll stay through the night
[x2]

You're gonna hate him
Then you'll want me
Then you'll miss him
Then you'll hate me
Girl, I know you so well
(Girl, I know you so well)
Girl, I know your routine
(Yes I know your routine)

You're gonna hate him
Then you'll want me
Then you'll miss him
Then you'll hate me
Girl, I know you so well
(Girl, I know you so well)
Girl, I know your routine

Well here comes the sun
And you're in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you'll stay through the night

This house is not a home to you.
But you decide to go ahead, and lay down, lay down.
There are no words to describe the depth of your indifference.
Cause I see your here to stay.
Should've known to pick my fate, Oh no.

I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong (to let you in my)
To let you in my home. (Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)
Ohhhhhhh

Hey there lonely girl.
Did you have to tell your friends about the way I got you screamin, my name?
Did you have to tell the world?
Now your girls all wanna fuck.
Girl you coulda been the one
Gotta change my number twice a month
When you coulda simply kept me on the down low.

I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong (to let you in my)
To let you in my home. (Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)
Ohhhhhhh

Baby, if I knew you'd be living in my sheets
I wouldn't've shown you any love
I would've left you in the club
You say you don't belong!
You keep saying there's no one.
And there's no where to go.
But who keeps calling on your phone?
I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong

I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong (to let you in my)
To let you in my home. (Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep
(Never felt so damn weak)
Ohhhhhhh
I'm so wrong, I'm so wrong (to let you in my)
To let you in my home. (Now you know where I sleep)
Now you know where I sleep

Ohhhhhhh---

There comes a time in a man's life
When he must take responsibility
For the choices he has made
There are certain things that he must do
Things that he must say
Like "I love you"
And "I need you"
"I only want you"
And nobody's going to know
If it's true (ooh)

I never thought I'd feel this kind of hesitation (tonight)
My hand on another girl (ooh)
I wish I didn't have to lie
I wish I could let you know
Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true

Valerie
I know you can see through me
(I know you can see through my lies, oh oh)
Valerie (oh Valerie)
You just choose to never know
(No you just don't know, what I do, what I do)
Valerie (Valerie)
Why pretend to trust in me?
(I don't know why you try to trust in me baby, but I think I might know)
Valerie
You'd rather this than be alone
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you (oh)
And nobody's going to know if it's true

Cause I love you (ooh)
And I need you (yea)
I only want you (ooh)
And nobody's going to know if it's true

And I love you (cause I love you baby)
And I need you (and I need you)
I only want you
And nobody gonna know (ooh) ---

It was so hard to say the same thing 
And you're so weak to say the same thing 
Girl don't hold onto your apprehensiveness 
And let the wildfire shine 
And repeat after me 
Good girls go to heaven, 
And bad girls go everywhere 
And tonight I will love you 
And tomorrow you won't care 

(Precious little diamond 
I leave it all to you 
Precious little diamond 
Let it come to you)

You believe in something stronger than trust

You're too shy away from me 
Just sacrifice your every last inhibition 
I'm on your side 
Don't patronize 
You know tonight 
Is the only time we'll have each other 
Why would you try to waste this precious time? 
Cause tonight I'll be right here 
And tomorrow you won't care

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (x4)

I feel the blood rushin' throughout ya body
You see the scars painted over my skin
I'm always numb to the topic of loving
I fell in love with the subject of sin

I don't have to remind you, oh ohhh
It's my need to confine you, oh ohhh
I see your face every time I'm with somebody else
Can't you see that I want you? (Put your feelings behind you)
I don't have to remind you (don't have to remind you)

Where you belong

I'm in control, when you give me your body, yeah
I feel our souls burnin' up when I'm, inside of you and I
I'ma leave a mark, just to remind you, where you belong, baby
Give me your all, scream as loud as you want---

I let my girl back home 
I don't love her no more
And she'll never fucking no that
These fucking eyes that i'm staring at
Let me see that ass
Look at all this cash
And i Emptied out my cards to her
Now i'm fucking leaning on that

Bring your love baby i could bring my shame
Bring the drugs baby i could bring my pain
I got my heart right here
I got my scares right here
Bring the cups baby i could bring the drank
Bring your body baby i could bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking words to
Just let me motherfucking love you

Listen ma' i'll give you all i got
Get me off of this
I need confidence in myself
Listen ma' I'll give you all of me
I need all of it to myself

So tell me you love me
Only for tonight
Only for one night
Even though you don't love me
Just tell me you love me
I'll give you what i need
I'll give you all of me
Even though you don't love me

Let me see you dance
I love to watch you dance
Take you down another level
And get you dancing with the devil
Take a shot of this
But I'm warning you 
I'm on that shit that you can't smell baby
So put down your perfume

Bring your love baby i could bring my shame
Bring the drugs baby i could bring my pain
I got my hear right here
I got my scars right here
Bring the cups baby i could bring the drank
Bring your body baby i could bring you fame
And that's my motherfucking word too
So let me motherfucking love you

Listen ma'I'll give you all I got
Get me off of this
I need confidence in myself
Listen ma' I'll give you all of me
Give me all of it
I need all of it to myself

So tell me you love me
Only for tonight
Only for one night
Even though you don't love me
Just tell me you love me
I'll give you what you need
I'll give you all of me
Even though you don't love me---Lyrics submitted by Adry Conchas.

[XO]
Shots of the Henny, bottles of Patron
Blunts to your face, you don't wanna sing no more, lost your C notes
Cabbed all day, took the bus back home
Evictions on your door, blame it on the weed, blame it on the booze
Blame it on the night life, light's passin' you, yeah
Just don't blame it on me, that you wanna come and party
With a nigga like me, cause I get it
You're built like a Goddess
And it seems like you been stressin'
'Specially when your nose red
From that K, special Diet Coke
You need more bread, ‎now you got no rent
You blow that money, money
You try to window shop, you blow another hundred
She's fuckin' goons in the day
Hipster nights downtown and your daddy don't know you're out

If they don't let you in
You know where to find me
Cause if you wanna go again
You can always call me
Cause all we ever do is love
Open up ya' mind, you can find the love
Girl you ain't alone
We all been alone
Baby just be honest

XO ohh, don't you forget
XO don't you worry 'bout a thing
XO we'll be everything you need, just believe
XO yea, XO and woah

I love it when your eyes are red
Ah yea, are you on my cloud yet?
Cause I got a brand new cam, can we video feed, can we POV
I wanna catch you at your best
When your hair's a mess
You look so depressed
And you're filled with regret
And you feel like you gotta go home

Cause these nights pass, so much quicker then the days did
Same clothes you ain't ready for your day shift
But you up you need money for ya' face lift
Lust over love
Is ya' mindset
Waken up with most of ya' side wet
Another room, you hear your mom cryin'
Cause she found your bag stuffed in the laundry
And the Bacardi from the last party

If they won't let you in
You know where to find me
And if you wanna go again
You can always call me
Cus all we ever do is love
Open up ya' mind you can find the love
Girl you ain't alone
We all been alone
Baby just be honest

XO Ohhhh
Don't you forget
XO
Don't you worry bout' a thing
XO
We'll be everything you need
Just believe
XO
Yeaaa
XO
Woooaaahhh

(The Host)

I need, I need something from you
Oh, there's so much love to pass around
There's too much love
Girl, the night's almost done
And who you came with is already gone
You said you want me
But I remember who you are
Girl, it wasn't long ago
Didn't think I'd go this far
I got a test for you
You said you want my heart
Well, baby you can have it all
There's just something that I
Need for you is to meet my boys
I got a lot of boys
And we can make you right
And if you get too high
Baby, come over here and ride it out
Oh, oh, ooh yeah
Ride it out
Oh, oh, whoa yeah
Ride it out
Ride it out
Just ride it---Lyrics submitted by Ambistaytrue.
