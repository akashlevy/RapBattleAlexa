[Verse 1: Jadakiss] 
24/7 365 
if we aint breaking them down 
then we letting them fly 
nah never I, always we 
I came in the game dividing the pies by three 
then we got famish 
so we set standards 
very similar to the ten crack commandments 
some couldn't take it 
others got lost and couldn't make it 
he wanted to floss but couldn't fake it 
the hood embraced it 
the rest is basics 
no need to rush be extra patient 
the new 4 door Porsche is extra spacious 
same entourage no extra faces 
hands down the best no explanations 
and to the top is the next destination 
there aint no time outs 
death is the only time we gon sign out 
so we gon grind out 

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 
Now we Shinin hard 
just like we want to do 
grindin day and night 
so we can kick off our shoes

[Verse 2: Jadakiss] 
Top 5 dead or alive what they consider them 
soon as them things come in we get rid of em 
mo money mo problems gota live with em 
only thing they care about is what you givin them 
not the energy that you wasted in the game 
or the tears that tripled down your face from the pain 
the time the jaw cracked you wasted the cane 
had to do two shifts to make it the same 
that all changed soon as you tasted the fame 
and it was all worth it after you made you a name 
thanks to our heavily father 
we fly on the jet now instead of the charter 
leave a nice tip in the front for the gardener 
do all of listening so we stay smarter 
everybody's a hero when they get scarred up 
its my ball check it up y'all better guard up 

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige] 
Now we Shinin hard 
just like we want to do

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige] 
We step up out of our car 
the whole damn world is lookin at us 
cause they knew what's wrong before 
now we aint hurt no more 
you can bring me the bill 
ill sign my name 
now were flying private planes and such 
lookin like a million bucks 
you cant tell me nothing 

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]

Yeah, yo, I'm the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
Mother of pearl delivery, voice of God
And...it's hard just being the boss
Being I can't go to jail cause them years'll cost me
Don't get me wrong, lay a nigga down if he force me
Rather just sit back and roll a dutch
Think how I'ma put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how I'ma get the 'caine over Customs
Never underestimate niggaz, or over trust them
Uh...yeah them M's is right in my face
I just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it don't jam, the Tech will spray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
Cause I'm a nigga that hate to settle
I'm a man of the Lord but I still can't escape the devil
Moved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, that time is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, start acting up, and I'll leave you underground

[Jadakiss]
I know how to get my pairs off me
They can cry and die from high blood pressure cause tears are salty
It's a symptom if you bobbin your head
Know that he's sick, know the flow is ridic', now throw him a grip
When I get it, you already know I'm throwin them bricks
Puttin purple everywhere, daddy, I'm throwin them nicks
That's right, homey, you can't move me
I ain't goin nowhere, I'm in the hood like bootleg movies
All you shootin is the breeze, a bootleg uzi
I'm just waitin on a que like Suzie, don't lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
Into something else that'll make something melt
You just gotta feel the kid
if not rap for the fact of how real he is, whatever

[Chorus]

[Jadakiss]
Aiyo, niggaz know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap, now he put out two anthems a year
And I just wanna rock for a century
Then chase the book with the documentary
If you, can't do nothin other than flow
Life's a bitch like the mother from +Blow+, let's go
Don't make me put your heart in your lap
Fuck ridin the beat, nigga, I parallel park on the track
Hop out lookin crispy, fresh and new
In the six, but it's a BM, and it's Pepsi blue
And, I don't know you.
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Ya'll ain't fuckin with Jason
After I cash in, there's really no justification
Of how I'm gonna change the game, so don't get outta line
Cause this little nine will change your frame, what up

Verse 1
Jadakiss:
Yo Shawty is courageous, 
Going through the stages, 
Of where her body is more mature, 
Than her age is, 
Far from the daddy's little girl type, 
Can't even imagine what her world's like, 
It all started off as a youngin, 
Stepfather used to touch her, 
And she couldn't say nothing, 
The more she held in the pain, 
It kept coming, 
Eventually it scarred her for life as a woman, 
And then he just kept touching her, 
Inside that was crushing her, 
I got something to discuss with her, 
I'm coming with the tech, 
With the ear holes and the mufflers.

Jadakiss:
Yo now she really stressed bad, 
Baby by her step dad, 
Her and lil man, 
All alone up in Westhave, 
Tough road, 
And without a car, 
It's a tough walk, 
Worse part about it, 
Is her mom think it's her fault, 
Word get around yall, 
Know how the town talk, 
Baby girl is innocent, 
Labeled ah the town whore, 
Suicidial thoughts on her mind, 
Even now more, 
First the abuse, 
Now she gotta raise her child poor, 
And that's why I feel for you, 
That's why I'm ready to kill for you, 
That's a black girl lost for ya,

Verse 3
Jadakiss:
It aint your fault boo, 
I'm always here for you to talk to, 
Hold your head high when you walk through, 
Sometimes the devil's temptation would force you, 
One thing about the Lord, 
He'd never cross you, 
Look at all the bad things that they tried to do to you, 
And you're still queen of this earth and you're beautiful, 
Everything happens for a reason, 
If you ever need me, 
Call me, 
I'm coming through squeezing.
