[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
The other day seen this girl walk by the other way
I would have spoke but when I looked at her she looked the other way
Had it been another day I would have grabbed her by the hand
You don’t know who I am but see I love the way you smile
Do you got a man I’d be honored if I can walk with you for a second
I said if you ain’t got no plans
I’m trying to get to know you cause you’re the type I go to
The type I write a song and make a beat about and flow to
Anything to show you how beautiful you are
Wish I could hold you at night and every morning say hello to you
But you don’t know it yet
Maybe I’ll approach you next time and let you know exactly how I feel about you
Until then I think of how fly it would be if it were her and I
The apple of my urban eye
And next time no lie I guess I’ll try cause I

[Hook: Erika Flowers]
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye (no lie she the apple of my eye)
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye (no lie she the apple of my eye)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
It was one week later when I ?? her at the bus stop
Laid eyes on her and it damn near made my heart stop
Caramel skin tight jeans and some high tops
Knowing I should go and talk to her fuck it why not
I walked over but I still couldn’t do it
It was something on my mind had me tripping going trough it
See fly girls always hurt you when they kiss you
And I’m never ?? cupid aims with his pistol
They leave wounds and they scab and they pus
Just when I was thinking that I look up and seen the bus
Come back to reality awoke out of my fantasy
That’s when I could swear she whispered come sit in the back with me
I put my eighty-five cents in and walked to the back where the only open seat was next to her
And I was extra sure until somebody sat first
Damn I guess my story got to wait until next verse

[Hook: Erika Flowers]
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye (no lie she the apple of my eye)
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye (no lie she the apple of my eye)

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
It was a hot ass bus ride in the middle of July
But she was so cool and so fresh and so fly
So this my opportunity to try and get at her
Is it cool if I sit and then a smile as a reply
I sat down and started talking to her
Careful what I say cause I ain’t want to sound awkward to her
Said I been ?? you but I ain’t never spoke
And I figured if I try I probably choke
Then she laughed and looked at me acting like I told a joke
And said ?? talk I been trying
And plus I always see you with him and she laughed again
But what she said next took me for a spin

[Verse 4: Erika Flowers]
I saw you on stage never thought you looked my way
Waiting for a shooting star every night of everyday
To wish for a chance to bite the apple of my eye
Forbidden juices had me ??

[Hook: Erika Flowers]
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye (no lie she the apple of my eye)
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye (no lie she the apple of my eye)
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye (no lie she the apple of my eye)
I wish I could show you exactly how I feel for you
And I tell you you’re the apple of my eye (no lie she the apple of my eye)
If I was not so shy I’d talk to you when you walk by ---Lyrics submitted by georgia.

If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special, way above normal 
and let her get away yo than this here's for ya
If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special, way above normal 
And let her get away yo than this here's for ya

Yo I first met her, at first didn't stress it
I guessed it
Probably wouldn't last, like the last few I messed with
It's bad when it breaks and you've got time invested
And shattered pieces of you're heart is what you're left with
It's why I touched no cuffs
But after five months
No lie yo she had me arrested
And so my conscious suggested
I slow down
Play a different role now
Give it a chance cause you never know
Weather it'll ever grow
And if she's special well man you better let her know
Before you let her go
Think twice cause stress comes after the N like the letter O
Wished I would've kept you
So I'm bitter in the rook
Wish'n that I woulda took a different approach
If I had a second chance I promise to try hard
When I reminisce over you my God

If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special, way above normal 
And let her get away yo than this here's for ya
If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special, way above normal 
And let her get away yo than this here's for ya

Friend told me, brody its a cold ass world
And our environment is full of cold ass girls
And they scandalous as us
As soon as one damages your trust
Never love em, just chase them till you bust
If the game gets played
And trust is betrayed
Than I'm heartless, so long I ain't the one to get played
First, but each time is worse than the previous
Them girls now a days do be devious
However by nature I'm naive
And perhaps believe
In the right circumstance true love can be conceived
But you does how I felt, but fell victim to doubt
I guess in the end I lost out
Cause without you I feel like, half of me is missin
I can't stop trippin
Cause I got us both into this position
But for a second chance I promise to try hard
When I reminisce over you my God

If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special, way above normal 
And let her get away yo than this here's for ya
If you ever lost a good one and felt all alone
Let her slip away and got left on your own
If you know she was special, way above normal 
And let her get away yo than this here's for ya---Lyrics submitted by Daniel.

Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving
Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
Let's get lost (x4)

[G-Eazy]
What it is, what it could be?
My imagination runs fast
Only if you comin' with me
4 AM staying up past
Or however long these drugs last
Don't know why I live so fast
They be telling me to slow down
I be screaming out "fuck that!"
I really wanna take you down
Moaning is how I wanna make you sound
Can't wait until I get you home
Fuck that I wanna take you now
Let’s do it all - have a ball
Hook up tonight in the ladies' room stall
Follow you there I'll let you make the call
You can text all your friends say you'll see them tomorrow
That's if you're down
She never fucked the first night until now
Let me, plow
Faded, I'm drunk off the brown
Stayed up all night on the town
Act like tomorrow just doesn't exist
Time isn't real ain't shit on my wrists
Let go of everything then you have bliss
Then she told me this

[Devon Baldwin]
Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving
Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
Let's get lost (x4)

[G-Eazy]
Let's get lost tonight
You can be supreme Kate Moss tonight
Turn up in the Soho loft tonight
Do drugs, take 10 shots tonight
Awesome I’m naked with Naked and Famous jeans on the floor
Live a wild life, you ain't seen this before
You should give brains and I mean this for sure
That's what genius is for
Beautiful girl that I just met on tour
Another good girl that I'll probably destroy
Her life was stable until she met me
Sheltered and safe so she never gets freed
But she loves trouble she's drawn to the danger
Never goes crazy, I bet I can change her
I could make her fall in love with a stranger
Switch up the pace I don't mean Danny Granger
Can’t wait until tomorrow? I'm fine with today
You pretty as fuck and I'm tryna slay
"Let's do this right now" is what I'm trying to say
I can tell you don't love him, you're dying to stray
I do not give a fuck 'bout your ex
I'm not looking for love, I'm just looking for sex
Tension between us had me feeling vexed
Then she sent me a text...

[Devon Baldwin]
Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving
Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
Let's get lost (x4)

[G-Eazy]
That's that endless summer, never going back to school
We do what we want to, can't tell me no rules
Every night on the town, going out all the time
And I'm tryna take you down, only thing on my mind

[Devon Baldwin]
Take me down
Take me all the way down, soon I'll be leaving---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.

Yeah I get a lot of checks and yeah I have a lot of sex
And labels know I got up next
Yeah she knows she got the best
I got her wet she got undressed
I nutted all across her chest
I don't even gotta flex, I never do respond to texts
And now she went and got obsessed
Y'all are just the hottest mess
And simply you are not complex
I'm sorry I am not impressed
Back on my bullshit again
I am having way too much fun
I'm in a section with 7 Kate Mosses around me
I swear I can't only touch one
Whiskey no rum
I gave her something to rub on her gum and her face went numb
Still going dumb cause I know where I'm from
Bruh, bruh I speak that Bay Area tongue

Alcohol and weed, really anything you need
Best believe we got a lotta that
Studio we're hella purped
I just put in hella work now look at where it got us at
Heard you got some new shit coming
Friends are all like "shoot me something
Homie when you dropping that?"
Maybe I could be the biggest
Rapper working in the business, wait, I never thought of that
Just take a look at the scores, I put numbers up on the boards
I'm in a section with models
And you're at the bar tryna get at a cluster of fours
When that bottle pours I just keep drinking it straight
And get faded and pass out on floors
Homies like "Bro, that's my girl, what the fuck are you doing?"
Oops, ain't know that was yours!

Ah, I just shitted on you
Probably licking your honey like Winnie the Pooh
Knock you on the ground then I'm lifting my boot
He get beat like Timbalands head of my group
These ain't Louboutins, but there's red on my shoe
Cause I let that Ruger fly like a pelican do
This rapper shit light, I'm telling you, dude
When I flow niggas drown on jell-o canoes
Better love your algebra and your decimals too
Cause you square motherfuckers can't mess with my crew
Your bitch on my dick and her lesbian boo
They kiss on the dick, I caress on the boobs
Now I'm just deciding on what R.Kelly'll do
Just pissed on that bitch, filled her belly with juice
Then I made lemonade from my testicle, boo
That's what a nigga get when you testing my crew (boo)

(The British are coming)
Man, I gotta lotta bitches
All up on my dick and down it
"Can I suck you off" is all I'm really used to hearing
Call me Mr. Greedy cause I'm not the [?] chairman
I'm always seeing doubles so my bitches come with medicine
They tryna fuck with me
On my white girl sniffing Britney
They never used to notice now they digging me
Reverse Gerald's name cause I get 'em Eazy-G
Fat boy talking out of turn
My brothers leave you sleeping in an urn
Yeah, I've had a lotta sex
And yeah, I've cut a lot of checks
I'm counting so much paper until my fuckin' fingers hurt
Swear it's deaded off to be so hurry bring a hearse
Holler at my at my manager it's taken for reverse
That's why I'm filling these empty duffle bags with features
Don't come around my presence with your mother's empty purse

Cause I'm in love with these Tumblr girls, with skinny waists and drug habits
Pretty faces love status, she acts as if she's the baddest
Man I swear she's just like tons of girls, she expects the free drinks
And I'm successful she thinks, always comes around when weed stinks
We fuck off and on, off and on, only ever really fuck off and on
Never see her these days cause I'm often gone
When I'm home off tour never stop for long
Back this week from across the pond
Noticed I was close to the block she's on, elevator to the floor her loft is on
Drinking whiskey, she likes vodka strong
But after we fuck it's over, walked out the door; that's closure
No I can't stay here and hold her, tomorrow act like I don't know her
Wouldn't ever be here sober, can't tell which one is colder
My clothing's on, we both did wrong, I gotta go that's what I told her

[G-Eazy]
She said she can't feel her face, right now I can't feel my heart
For your feelings there's no place, but you knew that from the start
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last [x2]
Meant to die, we moved fast and then we crashed
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last

[G-Eazy]
She's fine as fuck and she knows it, sexy body she shows it
Loves the drama she chose it, she draws the line then she blows it
The most fun I suppose it, pops a bottle won't close it
Fills a fifth then she throws it, she pops a bar now she's dozing
She's hot and cold, hot and cold, homie I don't know she's hot and cold
Truly the bullshit has gotten old, superficial with a rotten soul
Fucking off and on, always stop and go
Probably got someone, choose not to know
Head to her place then we lock the door
Making bad calls when I'm off the blow
Cause she's a bitch, I'm selfish, want every girl, can't help it
And it's tough for me to shelf it, it's you I see myself with
Right now I know you felt it, I touched her then she melted
We shouldn't chill but we do it still, gotta play the hand if you dealt it

[G-Eazy]
She said she can't feel her face, right now I can't feel my heart
For your feelings there's no place, but you knew that from the start
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last [x2]
Meant to die, we moved fast and then we crashed
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last

[Christoph Andersson]
Missing everything you say, it's not important what you stand for
You're asking will he be the one, I'll be gone before you're done tonight
Waiting for another day, you're not getting what you paid for
Trying to salvage what's undone and deny you got outrun tonight
Never knew her name, they're looking all the same to me
They only chase the fame, there's no one left to blame but me---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
