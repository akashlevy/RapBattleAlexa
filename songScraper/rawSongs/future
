The coolest dj in the world
G for Global
Yea we global now
Forever

I put spikes around my jacket
And I'm strapped up with a ratchet
I'm chasing after paper
I became a savage
A nigga set my nigga up
The game is full of madness
Sometimes I wanna get inside that Escalade and crash it
My pain running deeper than the ocean (it is)
My pain running deeper than the ocean (no tears)
My pain running deeper than the ocean (I can take it)
Pain running deeper than the ocean

Leather jackets
No motorcycle
I'm spiked up like a bad drink
9 to 3
That good supreme
Where all the scissile
Boy guillotine
I work hard and it came out
I turnt up
Turn the bitch off
Then I went from dead broke
To laying up in a penthouse
There are no secret
When you leaking
I woke up the evening
And I seen a demon
I'm on that rare codeine
Trying to clear my thoughts
Niggas won't feel my pain
All they see is fame
And what it bring
I paid dues
Graduated from finesse schools
I showed and proved
I never lose
I'm too smart
I should have went to Harvard
Drinking out the bottle
Holding maseratti

I put spikes around my jacket
And I'm strapped up with a ratchet
I'm chasing after paper
I became a savage
A nigga set my nigga up
And game is full of madness
Sometimes I wanna get inside that Escalade and crash it
My pain running deeper than the ocean (it is)
My pain running deeper than the ocean (no tears)
My pain running deeper than the ocean (I can take it)
Pain running deeper than the ocean

Taking three drugs at one time
Take em one time
And you niggas start hating on future
For one time
I commit a million crimes
That ain't enough for you
I'ma say a million rhyme
All the shit I've been through
I was grinding hard
Niggas try to hold me back
They didn't wanna see me with the plug
They didn't wanna see me with the sack
I got it though
It worked out
I kept the lawyer
I set standards
And now I'm royal
Niggers try to chase the paper
Then you got to take his life
Till we get screaming
I can't sleep right
Then they put a hit on your head
Then you walk around with a price
Million ain't way what you see
Better go good on sight

I put spikes around my jacket
And I'm strapped up with a ratchet
I'm chasing after paper
I became a savage
A nigga set my nigga up
And game is full of madness
Sometimes I wanna get inside that Escalade and crash it
My pain running deeper than the ocean (it is)
My pain running deeper than the ocean (no tears)
My pain running deeper than the ocean (I can take it)
Pain running deeper than the ocean ---Lyrics submitted by maceo.

(feat. Snoop Dogg)

[Hook: Future and Snoop Dogg]
You say you wanna take a ride? Get in
I grew up on that other side, getting it in
You niggas selling a bunch of pies, snatch a Benz
I heard you say it's going down, I'm going in
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide (murder, murder)
Go tell 'em it's a homicide, ya ya

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Fighting, shooting, killing, riding
Cripping, tripping, spitting fire
In the kitchen, baking pies
Taking mines, making mines
Yellow tape, black gun
Fill it with them hollow shells
And leave the scene bloody
Buddy can't nobody tell
Catch a plane to the ATL
Lay low in a cheap motel
Whatever suits ya
And get a few thangs from my cousin Future
Now I'm back on and popping like
Trapping, rapping in the cut
Talk shit, I fuck you up
They don't recognize who I am or where I'm from
So I hit the strip club banging 20 Crip cause
Treble with the bass, put that thang up in yo shavening
And leave yo body bleeding on the pavement

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Future]
How many a ride for you, open up that fire for you
You gotta question a nigga standing next to you, cut him off
I grew up on the side you gotta make yourself a boss
Niggas'll shit on you any chance they get
Cross you out on a lick
If you ain't ready for the ending then quit
It's a dirty world, you gotta get your hands dirty
I'm going for the title with my hands on the rifle
I put in the same work you put in, survival
Looking at my rival, they looking suicidal
Keep them bodies off wax, I can spot a rat
Let the guitar play, brrrat!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Future]
Slang a bunch of packs, and go and snatch a Benzo
I played them streets as a young nigga, ain't never liked Nintendo
Them gangstas in the yard, them my motherfucking kinfolk
They'll kidnap you and yo broad (in broad) daylight, no pretendo
I grew up 'round a bunch of monsters, call that pressure on ya
Be so scared for ya life, you call the police on ya
You ready say you ready
You gon' starve or you want fetti? Yo life'll change a second
Good or bad, don't open yo mouth, make sure you shut it
Ain't no telling who listening, make a wise decision
I'm from 'cross the tracks, like Boosie
If you ride, you better know who shooting

[Intro]
You know, This just some real nigga shit, a real nigga story
You know what I'm saying?

[Hook]

Slang a bunch of narcotics (then what)
Pull up in that new rarri (yea)

Chopping bricks like karate (chwaaa)
Drink a bunch of codeine (drank)
Serving to the dope fiends (they smokers)
Blowing money, stay clean (free bands)
Michael Jackson, Billy Jean

[Verse 1: Future]
Got a panamera round a young nigga neck (porche)
Got a young bitch pulling up in a vet (she working)
Smoke a lot of kush & I have a lot of sex
Had to beat the grind up, ran up my check
Bitch nigga get money, nigga get that
Roll a blunt of chronic, nigga sell a lot of crack
You can hit a nigga line, order what you want
I can whoop a Maserati, pulling up a donk
50,000 on yo watch, young nigga splurge
Pop a ace of spade bottle, sip a lot of syrup
Keep a young nigga workin' .....
I'mma take a phone call, hustle everyday

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Future]
Whipping up a cake, just to go and snatch a spider
Young nigga play with keys, like a type writer
Al Capone, John Gotti was a nigga idle
I was never snitching, I can put that on the Bible
In a 4 door beamer, driving with a rifle
Nigga where you at, nigga we go pull up on ya
Young Bitch looking like Janet in the 80's
We was grinding up from a tube & a baby
Got the girl dripping wet like a jerry curl
Got a styrofoam cup and its full of syrup
Send it over from Lil Mexico & Let me Work
I can get 36 for a clean shirt

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Casino]
Hol' up sir, you in my Rari
Money like I'm Frank Matthews
Killers around me like I'm Gotti
If I tricked you, know I'm sorry
I be fresh don't need no stylist
I be geeking on them mollies
Sell remix don't sell no cleans
My hand like a triple beam
I got workers like machine
All I do is sell dreams
Have my niggas serve fiends
I get up and then I lean

[Hook]---

Everybody getting high
Getting high, getting high, getting high

Girl go ahead and show me how you go down
And I feel my whole body peaking
And I'm fucking anybody with they legs wide
Getting faded with some bitches from the West Side
East coast, nigga repping North Side
Never waste a hoe's time (Freebands)
Bitch, I'm on my own time
Fuck a nigga co-sign
Always change my number and my phone line
Baby girl, I don't lie
Used to have no money for a crib
Now my room service bill cost your whole lot
If they try to stunt me, I go all out military
I'm camo'ed all out, like I'm in the military
I free up all my niggas, locked up in the penitentiary

Cause I'm always repping for that low life
Repping for that low life turn up

If she catch me cheating, I will never tell her sorry
If she catch me cheating, I will never tell her sorry
Porches in the valley, I got Bentleys, I got Raris
Taking pain pills on the plane, getting chartered
Popping tags on tags, I was starving

Turn a five star hotel to a traphouse
Roaches everywhere, like we forgot to take the trash out
Flood my cross with ice, getting money my religion
Got my baby momma and my side bitch kissing
I turn the Ritz into a lean house
This my sixth time getting kicked out
I can't feel my face, I'm on Adderall, nauseous
Niggas tryna ride my fuckin' wave, now they salty
Running with the wave, get you killed quick
Shoot you in your back like you Ricky

KE & Young Future bringin' them the fire
All this damn cash make a bitch wanna retire
Gotta drop a half a brick you wanna put me on a flyer
'Cuse me but my lingo crazy
See these diamonds ain't none of 'em forgave me

Two bad bitches wanna fuck me the greatest
Aye Young G in a brand new Mercedes

[Verse 2]
Billionaire boy that's true inspiration
Learned the Astronaut Kid no such thing as limitation
Flyin' down 20 in the mothafuckin' spaceship
Just left Magic in the mothafuckin' (dayship?)
Two bitches trailin' in a platinum Infiniti
Gotta thing for me, don't wanna sing for me, they like my energy, I'm a embassy
I know tricks like Cris Angel
Ion trick but I could make you famous
You would disappear from yo past life
You a rare pair, go outta sight
I'm Pluto talkin', Jimmy walkin' when you walkin'
I used to be fly but now I'm hawkin'
I was an Earthlin' now I'm SiFi
While I, I stay High
My bitches on they high horse
I double back like two cups
And pull out in that new Porshe

[Chorus]---

[Chorus]
We made a bond from the very beginning
I found my homey and my best friend
Imma be there for ya till the very end,
No matter what, no matter what, no matter what, yeah
We broke the rules, we took it further in
We made a promise to each other we gon' never end...
she gone be there for the kid, no matter what
No matter what, no matter what, yeah

[Future]
We met through a mutual friend
We started clubbing, dranking, talking, laughing and grinning
You had your eyes on me the whole time,
I could see ya through my lens
Your face your shape and the lil things about ya...had the kid all in
Anytime we spend time, we spend more than we spend benjamins
But the fuck this high siddity girl want to do with an astronaut kid...
I'm asking myself questions, I had to understand...
You gotta live and learn to make mistakes to be the man
We didn't mean for it to get this serious...
I got another nigga bitch with me
And I'm falling for her, yeah I'm falling for her
We ain't got no strings attached
I want her more and more

[Chorus]
We made a bond from the very beginning
I found my homey and my best friend
Imma be there for ya till the very end,

We made a promise to each other we gon' never end...
she gone be there for the kid, no matter what
No matter what, no matter what, yeah

[Future]
We can talk about whatever, we can fuck wherever
It's like we're walking on rose petals, when we together...
I see you jocking me, and I'm jocking you harder...
You got everything a woman want, I still want to spoil ya
And your loyalty to him ain't my concern cause you're loyal
It's like we been casted with a spell or both ate some poison
Tell him I ain't mean to intervene with his main thing
You my main fling, I took it main stream
Everyday its nice to share our main dreams, and ain't a damn thing...
Will never come between, our thing
And we ain't mean for it to be this serious...
I made a promise to you and I'ma take it serious
Cause I know my words mean the most to you
And you mean the most to me
We got a special connection, can't nobody come between

[Chorus]
We made a bond from the very beginning
I found my homey and my best friend
Imma be there for ya till the very end,
No matter what, no matter what, no matter what, yeah
We broke the rules, we took it further in
We made a promise to each other we'd never end...

[Chorus:]
I go through hell so walk with you
I'm taking chances when I talk to you
Just so I can give you the good advice

And I just slowed down on my pocketloss
And when you in the streets that's how it goes,
When you in the kitchen cooking white
You go through hell to get to paradise

[Verse 1:]
I got some money but it's all dirty
I gotten a pocket during the chain worthy
And I done took my heart through so many surgeries,
Last night was woke around 4:30
It's hard to go to sleep you sleeping with the burden,
These niggas play for keep the streets

You have to practice what you
Preach gone take the courage,
You pain runnin hella deep don't get discouraged,
You in the belly of beast

You gotta pack miami heat they always lurkin',
You can't think about the guilt so many curses

We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on my pocketloss
And when you in the streets that's how it goes,
When you in the kitchen cooking white
You go through hell to get to paradise

[Verse 2:]
When you in the game playing file,
I hit a lick for hundred eighty-thou,
Blow it in 3 months I'm going out of town,
Get two bad bitches and hit greyhound,
I had to cut the couch down,
They tried to burn the cross down,
They even tried to bring god down
We shootin for the stars now,
We live above the ground,
Go from town to town,
Ridin round the city,
They treat you like Diddy,
With all these crimes shooter committed, they must be winning
It's only the beginning,
And we ain't even finish, I came from the highway
Right where the lighty city,
This ain't the ending

[Chorus:]
I go through hell so walk with you
I'm taking chances when I talk to you
Just so I can give you the good advice
We go through hell to get to paradise
And I just slowed down on my pocketloss
And when you in the streets that's how it goes,
When you in the kitchen cooking white
You go through hell to get to paradise ---Lyrics submitted by Marquelle Bratc.

If everythang fell would run run through the rain, shine, thunderstorms
Would you fuck with the kid where I'm from.. Gotta hold my bong, hold my gun
When days get tight and I come in sweaty, Would you kiss all over me with yo tongue
Would you ride for the kid, would you lie for the kid? Death before dis-honor
When I'm on the road doin shows from mississippi all the way to hong kong
And we made the bond thats ways beyond loui vuitton loui vuitton, don't worry bout the money, the money gone come (Racks!)
I just need to know these two questions

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
If some things on my mind I need to get off
Can I come to you?
When I need to talk
If I ever get lost, can you help me find my way back to my vault
Would you cherish yo kid like you never had did
Could you love me? Could you love my kids?
Can you be there for me like you never had been
Like any relationship you ever been in
We make a connection thats full of affection
Can you hold me down, knowin my profession
Will you wait for me patiently, tastefully
Will your loyalty lead to royalty
Can you answer these two questions please

[Chorus]
Would you ride for yo nigga
Thats all I wanna know
Would you die for yo nigga

I'm lookin for a rider, a rider, a rider

I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles at the same damn time

Gucci made in Italy, Bally belt I'm killing shit
The way I rock a jimmy Choo's the word got out I'm dealing it
I fuck her she a immigrant
Don't touch her she got benefits
Bussin down them benjimans
Fucking up on Louie kicks, that's the way I'm kicking it
Pharaoh garment cover me
Puerto Rican, Japanese, we laid up at the Double Tree
Yellow ice a bumble bee, pinky ring a quarter key
Iphone a metro, twerking off the whole thing
My ear ring a jelly bean, gangster lean and ireine
Red eyes no visine, I'm loc'd out on the bean
Horse shoes on my jeans, robbing jeans with the wings
Yellow bone on the team, trafficin that Yao Mings
Space boots with the spikes, go to AZ on a flight
Mail a hundred over night, Yeah yeah yeah yeah

I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles at the same damn time

I'm in Fifs with the sack going crazy
Got some diamonds around my neck no flugazy
Bad bitches in the suite, trying to bathe me
Just a young hood nigga, streets raised me
Working with a unit try and stretch it to another one
Drinking on that active and it taste just like some bubble gum
Thumbing through a check, boarding on the jet
Talking on the iPhone, sipping out the Styrofoam
That dirty got my mind gone, that money got my mind blown
VVS and white stones, VVS and white stones
I'm rolling like a rolling stone
Free Bands on Al Capone
And my cash way long, (turned up)
I see a bunch of clones

I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm in Pluto I'm in Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles at the same damn time

Give me an apartment and some water and I can swim
Got that gambino jumping out the gym
My young nigga serving jays outside crim
Jump across from me you know your chances slim
In my Aviator Gucci, like I'm driving planes
Flying cash in cash money, smell like cocaine
Doing Birdman numbers, making flips like Jackie Chan
Walk inside the jeweler drop a bail on ya rinng.
Spent so much at Louie gave me free champagne
In Bel Harbor shopping and they doing the same thang
And I keep my cup with me like a pimp
I check a Magic Don Juan, take a glimpse
Spike Lee need to get this shit on film

I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid at the same damn time
Fucking 2 bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles at the same damn time. ---Lyrics submitted by Jason Young Williams.

I'm lookin' for 'er 
I'm lookin' for 'er 
I'm lookin' for 'er 
I'm lookin' for 'er 

[Verse 1:] 
Is that her in the VIP-line 
With the Vuitton and Yves saint Laurent 
Used to drive the Nissan, now she in a Beamer 
I don't want 'er cause she from the corner 
And I heard that Beamer was a loner 
Her old man, the owner 
And I don't even drink Corona's 
We're the type to drink tomorrow 
On champagne forever 
On dirty Sprite forever 
You can come sit with me 
If you'd like to change the weather 
If you wanna live better 
We can buy a crib, wherever 
Don't get too thirsty, get used to this cheddar 
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous 
And if you see 'er 'fore I do tell 'er I wish that I've met 'er 

[Hook:] 
Turn on the lights 
I'm lookin' for 'er too 
I heard she keep her promises and never turn on you 
I heard she ain't gone cheat and she gon never make no move 
I heard she be there anytime you need 'er, she come through 
Turn on the lights 
I'm lookin' for 'er 
I'm lookin' for 'er 
I'm lookin' for 'er 
Turn on the lights 
I'm lookin' for 'er 
I'm lookin' for 'er 
I'm lookin' for 'er 
I'm lookin' for 'er 

 [Verse 2:] 
Send 'er my way 
Tell 'er I've been lookin' for 'er in the broad day 
Hangin' with the dope boys in the hallways 
And I know, to keep 'er, man, you gotta get that cake 
Turn on the lights 
I'm lookin' for 'er too 
I heard she got a pretty face and stand up like a stallion 
I heard that she a precious jewel, you treat her to medallions 
I wanna be the one to find out if I go to probly 
And if I get the number, you know I can't wait to dial it 
And if we get together, girl, you know we gon be wylin' 
And when we get together we make magic and it's ours 
Whenever you up here ain't nothin' nobody can do about it 

[Hook] 

[Verse 3:] 
She a hood girl 
But she a good girl 
She will miss me 
Now she ready for the world 
I want your energy 
To take control of me 
I've tried to go to sleep 
And seen 'er in my dreams 
Just in case I run across her today I'm a stay clean 
Just in case she recognize a face, send 'er to me 
And tell 'er I've been lookin' for 'er with a flashlight 
You can't tell her nothin' else because I got my cash right 
And tell 'er if she honest and promise she stay true 
Make sure, when you tell 'er, tell 'er we go out past the moon---Lyrics submitted by avonlea.
