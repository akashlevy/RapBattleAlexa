The air begins to feel a little thin
As I start the car and then I begin
To add the miles piled up behind me
I barely feel a smile deep inside me

And I begin to envy the headlights driving south
I want to crack the door so I can just fall out
But then I remember when you packed my car
You reached in the back and bucked up your heart

For me to drive away with
I began to understand
Why God died

The demons sat there waiting on her porch
It was a little dark so we held a makeshift torch
And when my car was far out of sight
He crept in her room and stayed there for the night

And then I felt chills in my bones
The breath I saw was not my own
I knew my skin that wrapped my frame
Wasn't made to play this game

And then I saw Him, torch in hand
He laid it out, what he had planned
And then I said, I'll take the grave
Please, just send them all my way

I began to understand
Why God died

The air begins to feel a little thin
As we're waiting for the morning to begin
But for now you told me to hold this jar
And when I looked inside, I saw
It held your heart

For me to walk away with
I began to understand
Why God died---Lyrics submitted by **Catie**.

Hello, we haven't talked in quite some time.
I know, I haven't been the best.
Of son 
Hello.
I've been traveling in the deserts of my mind.
And I haven't found a drop, of life.
I haven't found a drop, of you.
I haven't found a drop.
I haven't found a drop, of water.

Waaaaaater.
Oh, Oahhh.

I try desperately to run through the sand
As I hold the water in the palm of my hand.
Cause it's all that I have and it's all the I need.
And the waves of the water mean nothing to me.
But I tried my best and all the I can
To hold tightly onto what's left in my hand.
But no matter how, how tightly I will strain,
The sand will slow me down and the water will drain.

I'm just being dramatic.
In fact, I'm only at it again.
As an addict with a pen.
Who's addicted to the wind
As it blows me back and forth.
Mindless spineless and pretend.
Of course I'll be here again.
See you tomorrow but it's the end of today.
End of my ways as a walking denial.
My trial was filed as a crazy suicidal head case.
But you specialize in dying.
You hear me screaming "Father"
And I'm lying here just crying,
So wash me with your water.

Waaaater.
Ohh Oahhh.

Hello, we haven't talked in quite sometime.
I know I haven't been the best.
The son. Hello.
I've been traveling in the deserts of mind.
And I, I haven't found a drop, of life.

I haven't found a drop.

I don't fall slow like I used to
I fall straight down
You've stolen my air catcher
That kept me safe and sound

My parachutes will guide me
Safely to ground
But now the cord's not working
And I see you staring me down

I won't fall in
Love with falling
I will try to avoid
Those eyes

I think you would beat
The moon in a pretty contest
And the moon just happened to be
The very first thing that I missed

I was doing fine on my own
And there wasn't much I lacked
But you've stolen my air catcher
And I don't know if I want it back

I won't fall in
Love with falling
I will try to avoid
Those eyes

'Cause I'm not sure
I want to give you
Tools that can destroy
My heart

And I just don't say
What you want to hear
So I'll write my fears
And I don't believe
In talking just to breathe
And falling selfishly

I won't fall in
Love with falling
I will try to avoid
Those eyes

But now I'm here
To give you words
As tools that can destroy
My heart---

Open the slits in your face and start your day
You don't have much time to make your slits look just right
I'm in your mind
I'm singing
I'm in your mind
I'm singing la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da da

Look in the mirror and ask your soul if you're alright
Put out the glitter that your soul hides behind
You're in my mind
I'm singing
You're in my mind
I'm singing la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da da

Nowhere were they holy
Open up your eyes and see
The clouds above will hold you
The clouds above will sing

And in your mind
You're singing la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da la-da da---

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They will with fire, exhale desire, I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts so often I ought, to replace the slot with what I once bought
Cause somebody stole my care radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent

I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside
It's on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving
There's no hiding for me
Im forced to deal with what I feel
There's no distraction to mask what is real

I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts so often I ought, to replace the slot with what I once bought
Cause somebody stole my care radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder something terrifying
Cause this time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it's that we're all battling fear
Oh dear, I dont know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep
Please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound

There are things we can do
But from the things that work there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace will win and fear will lose

There's faith and there's sleep
We need to pick one please
Cause faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think


I have these thoughts so often I ought, to replace the slot with what I once bought
Cause somebody stole my care radio
And now I just sit in silence

And now I just sit in silence!

And now I just sit in silence!

And now I just sit in silence!

And now I just sit in Silence!

And now I just sit in silence!

And now I just sit in silence!

And now I just sit in silence!

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They will with fire, exhale desire, I know it's dire
My time today

I have these thoughts so often I ought, to replace the slot with what I once bought
Cause somebody stole my care radio
And now I just sit in silence---Lyrics submitted by Gabe.

Scared of my own image
Scared of my own immaturity
Scared of my own ceiling
Scared I'll die of uncertainty
Fear might be the death of me
Fear leads to anxiety
Don't know what's inside of me

Don't forget ab-b-b-b-bout me
Don't forget ab-b-b-b-bout me
Even when I doubt you
I'm no good without you, no, no

Temperature's dropping
Temperature's dropping
I'm not sure if I can
See this ever stopping
Shaking hands with the dark parts of my thoughts, no
You are all that I've got, no

Don't forget ab-b-b-b-bout me
Don't forget ab-b-b-b-bout me
Even when I doubt you
I'm no good without you, no, no no no no

Gnawing on the bishops
Claw away at this system
Repeating simple phrases
Someone holy insisted
Want the mark he's made on my skin
To mean something to me again
Hope you haven't left without me
Hope you haven't left without me, please

Don't forget ab-b-b-b-bout me
Don't forget ab-b-b-b-bout me
Even when I doubt you
I'm no good without you, no

Don't forget ab-b-b-b-bout me
Don't forget ab-b-b-b-bout me
Even when I doubt you
I'm no good without you, no no no no

Hey! Hey!
Don't forget about me, no
Hey! Hey!
Don't forget about me, no
Hey! Hey!
Don't forget about me, no
Hey! Hey!
Don't forget about me, no---

I’m fairly local, I’ve been around
I’ve seen the streets you're walking down
I’m fairly local, good people now

I’m evil to the core
What I shouldn't do I will
They say I’m emotional
What I want to save I’ll kill
Is that who I truly am?
I truly don’t have a chance
Tomorrow I’ll keep a beat
And repeat yesterday’s dance

Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It’s the few, the proud, and the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burning but we’re so cold
It’s the few, the proud, and the emotional

I’m not evil to the core
What I shouldn't do I will fight
I know I’m emotional
What I want to save I will try
I know who I truly am
I truly do have a chance
Tomorrow I’ll switch the beat
To avoid yesterday’s dance---

I want to drive away
In the night, headlights call my name

I, I'll never be, be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified
You say that you are close, is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

I'm so afraid 
Of what you have to say
Cause I am quiet now 
And silence gives you space

I'll never be, be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified
You say that you are close, is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

[RAP]
It’s the same game today as it always is, I don't give these places fake my name explaining this, and the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines that remind me of all the times... 
I have committed dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted to what I’ve done and what I’m doing I’m brewing and losing and spewing infusing and believe me that’s what all the kids are doing. 
What kids are doing are killing themselves, they feel they have no control of their prisoner’s cell, and if you’re one of them then you’re one of me, and you would do almost anything just to feel free... 
Am I right? Of course I am, convince me otherwise would take all night. Before you walk away, there’s one more thing I want to say, 

OUR BRAINS ARE SICK BUT that's OKAY.

Fake you out
I'll fake you out
I'll fake you out
I'll break you down
I'll fake you out 

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

(Repeat 2x)
All I wanna
Yeah, And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out

All I wanna

I'm so afraid 
Of what you have to say
Cause I am quiet now 
And silence gives you space---Lyrics submitted by Gabby.

I dont wanna fall fall away
I dont wanna fall fall away
I'll keep the lights on in this place 
cause i dont wanna fall away

I disguise and I will lie and i will take my precious time
As the days spent away as i stand in line 
and i dye as i wait as i wait on my crime
and ill try to delay what you make of my life but i don't want your way i want mine
i'm  dying and im trying but believe me i'm fine 
but im lying i'm so very far from fine and

I, I can feel the pull begin
Feel my conscience wearing thin
And my skin it will start
to break up and fall apart

I dont wanna fall fall away
I dont wanna fall fall away
I'll keep the lights on in this place 
cause i dont wanna fall away

Every time i feel selfish ambition has taken my vision 
my crime is my sentence repentance has take comission 
it's taking a toll on my soul i'm screaming submision and 
i don't know if i am dying or living 
cause i will save face for names sake abuse grace 
take aim to obtain a new name and a newer face 
but my name is lame i can't walk and i aint the same 
and my name i became a new destiny to the grave and

I, I can feel the pull begin
Feel my conscience wearing thin
And my skin it will start
to break up and fall apart

I dont wanna fall fall away
I dont wanna fall fall away
I'll keep the lights on in this place 
cause i dont wanna fall away---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.

I feel for you.
But when did you believe you were alone.
You say that spiders crawled inside 
And made themselves a home.
Where lions once were.

Petrified of who you are,
And who you have become.
You will hide from everyone
Denying you need someone
To exterminate your bones.

Friend, please remove your hands
From over your eyes for me.
I know you want to leave.
But friend please,
Don't take your life away from me.

Living like a ghost,
You walk by everyone you know.
You say that you're fine,
But you have lost your sway and glow.
So I stopped by to let you know.

Friend, please remove your hands
From over your eyes for me.
I know you want to leave.
But friend please,
Don't take your life away from me.

Would let me know your pain tonight?
Cause I just won't let go.
Till we both see the light.
And I have nothing else I have to say.
But I will listen to you all day.
Yes I will.

Friend, please remove your hands
From over your eyes for me.

We all are stranger creatures than when we all started out as kids
Culture forbids
We have romantic fantasies about what dying truly is
To fall off the grid

I know there's someone at the door
They called for help, of this I'm sure
But do I want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes
I'm holding on to what I know,
And what I know, I must let go
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along
For the eyes to sing along-long-long

We all know somebody who knows somebody who's doing great
I know some people who know people who are flying straight
But I'll kindly enter in to rooms of depression
While ceiling fans and idle hands will take my life again

We live for the night's decor
It reveals what we dream of

I know there's someone at the door
They called for help, of this I'm sure
But do I want to say goodbye to all the glowing eyes
I'm holding on to what I know,
And what I know, I must let go
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along

This room is far too dark for us to stay around
Redemption's not that far and darkness is going down
This room is far too dark for us to stay around
Redemption's not that far and darkness is going down

I'm holding on to what I know,
And what I know, I must let go
But I would rather play a song for the eyes to sing along
For the eyes to sing along-long-long

I know what you think in the morning
When the sun shines on the ground
And shows what you have done
It shows where your mind has gone.

And you swear to your parents
That it will never happen again
I know, I know what that means
I know

That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it, don't take it

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah.

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah.

Let's take this one second at a time
Let's take this one song, this one rhyme
Together, let's breathe
Together, to the beat

But there's hope out the window
So that's where we'll go
Let's go outside and all join hands
But until then you'll never understand

That you all have guns
And you never put the safety on
And you all have plans
To take it, don't take it

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't when you all have
Guns for hands, yeah.

We've turned our hands to guns, trade in our thumbs for ammunition,
I must forewarn you, of my disorder, or my condition,
'Cause when the sun sets, it upsets what's left of my invested interest,
Interested in putting my fingers to my head,
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids,
Fused at the wrist, I simply tell them they should shoot at this,
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music, it's,
Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist.

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't, 
When you all have
Guns for hands, yeah.

I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep
But I can't, but I can't, 
When you all have
Guns for hands, yeah.---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.

There’s an infestation in my mind’s imagination
I hope they choke on smoke cause I’m smoking them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something
Cause I wasn’t the only one who wasn’t rushing to say nothing
This doesn’t mean I lost my dream
It’s just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean

Gangsters don’t cry
Therefore, therefore I’m
Mr. Misty-eye, therefore I’m

Can you save
Can you save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save
Can you save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me, for me, oh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me, for me, oh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?

No I didn’t understand the thing you said
If I didn’t know better, I guess you’re all already dead
Mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch
Saying stuff like, "you only live once"
You got one time to figure it out
One time to twist and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now
Sing with me if you know what I’m talking about

Gangsters don’t cry
Therefore, therefore I’m
Mr. Misty-eye, therefore I’m

Can you save
Can you save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save
Can you save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me, for me, oh

I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more shotty,
I bet a lot of me was lost, 't's uncrossed and 'i's undotted,
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got,
Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat,
I must've forgot, you can't trust me,
I'm open a moment and close when you show it,
Before you know it I'm lost at sea,
And now that I write and think about it,
And the story unfolds,
You should take my life, you should take my soul.

You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain,
You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes.

And I'll be holding on to you.

Remember the moment you know exactly where you're going,
'Cause the next moment, before you know it,
Time is slowing and it's frozen still,
And the window sill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night,
right? Fight it, take the pain, ignite it,
Tie a noose around your mind loose enough to breathe fine and tie it,
To a tree, tell it, "You belong to me,
This ain't a noose, this is a leash,
And I have some news for you, you must obey me."

Entertain my faith.

Lean with it, rock with it,
When we gunna stop with it,

Is it time to move our feet to an introspective beat,
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts, it's our hearts that make the beat.---Lyrics submitted by Erin Rush.

A shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I won't let them win, go quietly
I won't let them win, go quietly

Be the one, be the one
To take my soul and make it undone
Be the one, be the one
To take me home and show me the sun
I know, I know
You can bring the fire, I can bring the bones
I know, I know
You make the fire in my bones, and make it grow

Where we're from, there's no sun
Our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one
Our hometown's in the dark
Our hometown's in the dark

A shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I won't let them win, go quietly
I won't let them win, go quietly

Put away, put away
All the gods your father served today
Put away, put away
Your traditions, believe me when I say
We don't know, we don't know
How to put back the power in our soul
We don't know, we don't know
Where to find what once was in our bones

Where we're from, there's no sun
Our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one
Our hometown's in the dark
Our hometown's in the dark

A shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I won't let them win, go quietly
I won't let them win, go quietly

Where we're from, there's no sun
Our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one
Our hometown's in the dark
Our hometown's in the dark---

She asked me, "Son, when I grow old,

And when your father turns to stone,
Will you take care of me?"

She asked me, "Son, when I grow old,
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone,

I will make you queen of everything you see,
I'll put you on the map,

Let's say we up and left this town,
And turned our future upside down.
We'll make pretend that you and me,
Lived ever after happily.

And when your father turns to stone,
Will you take care of me?"

I will make you queen of everything you see,
I'll put you on the map,
I'll cure you of disease.

And since we know that dreams are dead,
And life turns plans up on their head,
I will plan to be a bum,
So I just might become someone.

I know you're not a liar
And I know you could set fire
This day
Go ahead and make me look away
Strike me down
I am calling your lightening
Down from your dark hiding place
Go ahead and show me
Your face

Rain down
And destroy me
Rain down
And destroy me
Rain down

I mean no disrespect
I am simply very perplexed
By your ways
Why won't you let us
Use your name?

Rain down
And destroy me
Rain down
And destroy me
Rain down---

Now is the climax to the story
That gives the demons and angels purpose
They fly around while we are walking
And mold our emotions just to please them

I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly with no hope, no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I sing

All we are is an isle of flightless birds
We find our worth in giving birth and stuff
We're lining our homes against winding roads
And we think the going is tough
We pick songs to sing, remind us of things that nobody cares about
And honestly we're probably more suicidal than ever now

If you decide to live by, what you think's wrong and what's right
Believe me you'll begin to wish you were sleeping
Your weeping will creep in your head and you'll cry
But if we wake up every morning and decide what we believe
We can take a part our very heart and the light will set us free

I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly with no hope, no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I...

I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly with no hope, no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I sing

How frustrating and so degrading
His time, we're wasting
As time will fly by and the sky will cry as light is fading
And he is waiting, oh so patiently
While we repeat the same routine as we will please comfortability
Please don't think about why you can't sleep in the evening
And please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking
Your soul knows good and evil, your soul knows both sides
And it's time you pick your battle, and I promise you this is mine

He stays home from work this time.
He never really told his wife.
He never really told a lie.
But this time he decides that it's alright.
It's alright.

No one really knows his mind.
And no one knows behind his eyes.
The man deserves a medal,
But he's never really won a prize before.
He goes to lock the door.

He is falling.
And oh, he knows it.
The world looks down and frowns.

Get up Johnny Boy.
Get up Johnny Boy.
Get up, cause the world has left you lying on the ground.
You're my pride and joy,
You're my pride and joy.
Get up Johnny Boy.
Cause we all need you now.
We all need you, now.

Someone said, "Where you going"
Someone said to you, "Goodbye"
They deflect the disrespect.
When they say that they blame it on the times.
They blame it on the time.

We all know you're qualified to fix a chair and love your wife.
They all know you're qualified.
But they lie when they blame it on the times.
Oh we blame it on the times.

He is falling.
And oh, he knows it
The world looks down and frowns.

Get up Johnny Boy.
Get up Johnny Boy.
Get up, cause the world as left you lying on the ground.
You're my pride and joy.
You're my pride and joy.
Get up Johnny Boy.
Cause we all need you now.
We all need you, now.

I will carry all your names,
And I will carry all your shame. [3x]

Get up Johnny Boy
Get up Johnny Boy.
Get up cause the world has left you lying on the ground.
You're my pride and joy,
You're my pride and joy.
Get up Johnny Boy.
Cause we all need you now. [2x]---Lyrics submitted by Katie.

Nobody thinks what I think,
Nobody dreams when they blink,
Think things are on the brink of blasphemy,
I'm my own shrink,
Think things are after me,
My catastrophe, 
At my kitchen sink. 

You don't know what that means.
Because a kitchen sink to you,
Is not the same to me, 
Okay friend?

Are you searching for purpose?
Then write something,
Yeah it might be worthless,
Than paint something,
And it might be wordless 

Pointless curses, 
nonsense verses,
You'll see purpose start to surface

No one else is dealing with your demons,
Meaning maybe defeating them 
Could be the beginning of your meaning
Friend 

Go away...[4x]

Leave me alone..[4x]

OHHHH 

Leave me alone 

OHHHHH

Leave me alone  

OHHHHHH

Leave me alone 

Nobody think what you think,
No one, empathy might be on the brink 
Of extinction. They will 
Play a game and say they know
Exactly what you're going through. 
And I tried to come up with an artistic way, 
To say, they don't know you,
 And neither do I 

So here's an example of a stand up guy,
Who hates what he believes,
And loves it at the same time.
Here's my brother and his head's 
Screwed up, but that's alright 

Time gains momentum,
The moment when I'm living in 'em,
I'm winning a momentary sinning a 
Moment passing after a rebeginning
Moments mending memories,

Pretending enemies are friends of me,
Sending me straight to bending me, 
My bad behavior but I bet, I could have
Been a better man,

Copy and paste, caught me, and copy,
Better rhymes bother me, 
The better the rhythm the badder I am,
But I bet I'll battle with em battle

Better I am, gambling man, 
Better bet I am a gambling man,
I am

Go away...[4x]

Leave me alone..[4x]

Leave me alone

Done leave me alone

Ohhhhhhhhh[5x]---Lyrics submitted by caroline.

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

They think this thing is a highway
If it was our way
We'd have a tempo change every other time change
Cause our minds change on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood
But I know a thing or two about pain and darkness
If it wasn't for this music, I don't know how I would've fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless
Honest, there's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin'
In the industry it seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity is on the free when I'm playin' shows

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow? Will they be alive tomorrow?

I'm sorry if that question I asked last
Scared you a bit like a hazmat
In a gas mask
If you ask Zack
He's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
But let's back track, back to this
Who would you live and die for on that list
But the problem is, there's another list that exist and no one really think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality
If you get in between someone I love and me
You're gonna feel the heat of my calvary

All these songs I'm hearing are so heartless
Don't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?

Will they be alive tomorrow?
(Will they be alive tomorrow?)

They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?
They say stay in your lane boy, lane boy
But we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway
But will they be alive tomorrow?---

You say things with your mouth
Cobwebs and flies come out
I hear a second voice behind your tongue somehow
Luckily I can read your mind
Flies and cobwebs unwind
They will not take you down
They will not cast you out.

Dear friend, here we are again pretending
To understand how you think your world is ending
Sending signals and red flags in waves
It's hard to tell the difference between blood and water these days
I'll pray that one day you see
The only difference between life and dying
Is one is trying, that's all we're called to do
So try to love me and I'll try to save you.

Won't you stay alive
I'll take you on a ride
I will make you believe you are lovely.

Your redemption won't grow stale
We are now just setting sail
On the seas of what we fear
Treason now is growing near to me

I'm coming clean
God, hit me straight on.

Don't be gone.
You say things with your mouth, cobwebs and flies come out.---Lyrics submitted by Carlos Bonilla.

There's miles of land in front of us.
And we're dying with every step we take.
We're dying with every breath we make.
And I'll fall in line.

The stranger's back is all I see.
He's only a few feet in front of me.
And I'll look left and right sometimes,
But I'll fall in line.

No one looks up anymore,
Cause you might get a rain drop in your eye.
And heaven forbid they see you cry,
As we fall in line.

And about this time of every year,
The line will go to the ocean pier
And walk right off into the sea.
And then we fall asleep.

And as we near the end of land,
And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand.
I ask myself the question, "Why.. I fall in line?"
Then out of the corner of my eye,
I see a spaceship in the sky and hear a voice inside my head.
"Follow me instead."
"Follow me instead."
"Follow me."

Then the wages of war will start
Inside my head with my counterparts.
And the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase,
"This line's the only way."

And then I start down the sand.
My eyes are focused on the end of land.
But again the voice inside my head says,
"Follow me instead."
"Follow me instead."
"Follow me."

"Follow me instead." [5x]

Take me up,
Seal the door.
I don't wanna march here anymore.
I realize that this line is dead.
So I'll follow you instead.

So then you put me back in my place,
So I might start another day.
And once again I will be,
In a march to the sea.---Lyrics submitted by Katie.

The loser hides behind
A mask of my disguise
And who I am today
Is worse than other times
You don't know what I've done
I'm wanted and on the run
I'm wanted and on the run
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future

Release me from the present
I'm obsessing, all these questions
Why I'm in denial
That they tried this suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're messing with the message man

Hope you're dead cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
People they rhyme like this, we're all impressed by this
They rip it, flip it but these are just triplets
Wrote this in three minutes, three words to a line
It's just poetry divided, I'm the kind of guy
Who takes every moment, he knows he can fight it
And music to use it, for others to use it
You're dead cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
Life is up here but you comment below
When the comments will always become common
Motivation to promote you choose next episode
So your brain knows to keep going even though hope
Is far from this moment but you would not know it
Gets better when morning finally rears its head
Together we'll lose this, remember the future
Remember that morning is when night is dead

Release me from the present
I'm obsessing, all these questions
Why I'm in denial
That they tried this suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're messing with the message man

I’ve got a migraine and my pain will range from up, down, and sideways,
Thank God it’s Friday ‘cause Fridays will always,
Be better than Sundays ‘cause Sundays are my suicide days,
I don’t know why they always seem so dismal,
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle,
Whether it’s the weather or the letters by my bed,
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head,
Let it be said what the headache represents,
It’s me defending in suspense, it’s me suspended in a defenseless test,
Being tested by a ruthless examinant that’s represented best by my depressing,
Thoughts, I do not have writer’s block, my writer just hates the clock,
It will not let me sleep, I guess I’ll sleep when I’m dead,
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head.

Am I the only one I know,
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I’m alone,
But I know we’ve made it this far, kid.

I am not as fine as I seem, pardon,
Me for yelling, I’m telling you green gardens,
Are not what’s growing in my psyche, it’s a different me,
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees,
Freeze frame please, let me paint a mental picture portrait,
Something you won’t forget, it’s all about my forehead,
And how it is a door that holds back contents,
That make Pandora’s Box’s contents look nonviolent,
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence,
My mind’s shipwrecked, this is the only land my mind could,
Find, I did not know it was such a violent island,
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions,
They’re trying to eat me, blood running down their chin,
And I know that I can fight or I can let the lion win,
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find,
‘Cause sometimes to stay alive you got to kill your mind.

And I will say that we should take a day to break away,
From all the pain or brain has made,
The game is not played alone.
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it,
And keep it frozen and know that,
Life has a hopeful undertone.---Lyrics submitted by Chase Williams.

I don't know why
I just feel I'm better off staying in the same room I was born in
I look outside and see a whole world
Better off without me in it trying to transform it

You are out of my mind, oh
You aren't seeing my side, oh
You waste all of this time trying to get to me
But you are out of my mind

Listen, I know
This one's a contradiction because of how happy it sounds
But the lyrics are so down
It's okay though
Because it represents, wait, better yet it is
Who I feel I am right now

You are out of my mind, oh
You aren't seeing my side, oh
You waste all of this time trying to get to me
But you are out of my mind

Heard you say, "not today"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound
Heard your voice, there's no choice
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise

Don't you test me, no
Just because I play the piano
Doesn't mean I, I'm not willing to take you down

I, I'm out of my mind, oh
I'm not seeing things right, oh
I waste all this time trying to run from you
But I, I'm out of my mind

Heard you say, "not today"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound
Heard your voice, there's no choice
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise

You are out of my mind, oh
You aren't seeing my side, oh
You waste all of this time trying to get to me
But you are out of my mind

Heard you say, "not today"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound
Heard your voice, there's no choice
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise

Buh buh bah, buh buh bah
Bah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah bah
Buh buh bah, buh buh bah
Bah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah bah
Buh buh bah, not today
Bah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah bah
Buh buh bah, buh buh bah
Bah bah bah bah bah, bah bah bah bah bah

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh---

I wake up fine and dandy
But then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start
Planning my crash landing
I go up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving
Like an old man's hair receding

I'm pleading, "Please, oh please!"
On my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this
Is this living free?
I don't wanna be the one
To have the sun's blood on my hands
I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon, forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see harpoon

I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight

Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out
I must have kicked them out

I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone
They told me I was gone

But I tell 'em
Why won't you let me go
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant

Please tell 'em
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?

On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate
The start of a day when we put on our face
A mask that portrays that we don't need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us
But we open our eyes, 'cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling, "There's something we need!"
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore
Won't tell you who I'm singing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four

I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight

Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must have kicked them out
I must have kicked them out

I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
they told me I was gone
They told me I was gone

But I'll tell 'em
Why won't you let me go
Do I threaten all your plans?
I"m insignificant

Please tell 'em
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?

I'm sorry.---Lyrics submitted by anna rogers.

Oh Ms. Believer.
My pretty sleeper.
Your twisted mind is like snow on the road.
Your shaking shoulders prove that it's colder,
Inside your head, in the winter of death.

I will tell you, I love you.
But the muffs on your will cater your fears.
My nose and feet are running as we start,
To travel through snow.
Together we go. [2x]

We get colder,
As we grow older.
We will walk so much slower.

Oh Ms. Believer,
My pretty weeper.
Your twisted thoughts are like snow on the rooftops.
Please take my hand.
We're in foreign land,
As we travel through snow.
Together we go. [2x]

Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I, we got a lot of problems

You know where I'm coming from
Though I am running to you
All our feelings tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

I wanted to be a better brother, better son
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done
I have none to show to the one I love
But tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me down
Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems
Help me polarize, help me polarize, help me out
My friends and I, we got a lot of problems

Polarize is taking your disguises
It's separating em, splitting em up from wrong and right
It's deciding where to die and deciding where to fight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

I wanted to be a better brother, better son
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done
I have none to show to the one I love
But tonight, tonight, tonight, oh

I just wanna stay in the sun where I find
I know it's hard sometimes
Pieces of peace in the sun's piece of mind
I know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much
But it's fun to fantasize
All my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was
But it's fun to fantasize

Oh, oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Taking my time on my ride

I'd die for you, that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take
A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
I'd live for you, and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There are people back home which are talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're forming like
Who would you live for?
Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

Oh, oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride
Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride

I can't take them on my own, my own
Oh, I'm not the one you know, you know
I have killed a man and all I know
Is I am on the run and go.

Don't wanna call you in the nighttime
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight I'll need you to stay.

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do...

I am up against the wall, the wall
For I hear them coming down the hall
I have killed a man and all I know
Is I am on the run and go.

Don't wanna call you in the nighttime
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle

But tonight I'll need you to stay.

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do...

Cold nights under siege from accusations
Cerebral thunder in one-way conversations
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.

Don't wanna call you in the nighttime
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle

I do not know why I would go
In front of you and hide my soul
Cause you're the only one who knows it,
Yeah you're the only one who knows it

And I will hide behind my pride
Don't know why I think I can lie
Cause there's a screen on my chest
Yeah there's a screen on my chest

I'm standing in front of you
I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

I can't see past my own nose, I'm seeing everything in slo-mo
Look out below crashing down to the ground just like a vertical locomotive
That's a train, am I painting the picture that's in my brain?
A train from the sky, locomotive, my motives are insane
My flow's not great, okay, I conversate with people
Who know if I flow on a song I'll get no radio play
While you're doing fine, there's some people and I
Who have a really tough time getting through this life
So excuse us while we sing to the sky.

I'm standing in front of you
I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

We're broken
We're broken
We're broken
We're broken people, oh.
We're broken people, oh.

(We're broken
We're broken
We're broken
We're broken people, oh.

Night falls, with gravity.
The earth turns, from sanity
Taking my O-nly friend I know, 
Leaves a lie, His name is Hope

I’m never what I like
I’m double-sided.
And I just can’t hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I’m twisted up, I’m twisted up, inside.

The horrors of the night melt away
Under the warm glow of survival of the day
Then we move on, 
My shadow grows tall-er with my fears
And my friends shrink small as night grows near

When the sun is coming, window soothes
And the silver lining rides the hills
I will be saved for one whole day
Until the sun make the hills it's grave

I’m never what I like
I’m double-sided.
And I just can’t hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I’m twisted up, I’m twisted up, inside.

I’m never what I like
I’m double-sided.
And I just can’t hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I’m twisted up, I’m twisted up, inside my mind.

I’m semi-automatic, 
My prayers; schizophrenic 
But I’ll live on, yeah I’ll live on, yeah, I’ll live on 
[4x]

By the time the night wears off, the dust is down
And shadows burn
I will rise and stand my ground, 
Waiting for the nights return
I’m never what I like
I’m double-sided.
And I just can’t hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I’m twisted up, I’m twisted up, inside.

I’m never what I like
I’m double-sided.
And I just can’t hide
I kinda like it
When I make you cry
Cause I’m twisted up, I’m twisted up, inside my mind.---Lyrics submitted by Gabby.

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, cause we have the same nose, same clothes, home grown, the stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter

Used to play pretend, give each other different names, we would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face singing "wake up, you need to make money", yeah

We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, funny
We used to play pretend, wake up you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, bunny
We used to play pretend, wake up you need the money
Used to play pretend, give each other different names, we would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face saying "wake up, you need to make money", yeah---

I wanna fall inside your ghost
And fill up every hole inside my mind
And I want everyone to know
That I am half a soul divided

Sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away
Either way you're by my side until my dying days
And if I'm not there and I'm far away
I said, "Don't be afraid."
I said, "Don't be afraid. We're going home."

I wanna strip myself of breath
A breathless piece of death I've made for you
A mortal writing piece of song will help me carry on
But this you heard

Sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away
Either way you're by my side until my dying days
And if I'm not there and I'm far away
I said, "Don't be afraid."
I said, "Don't be afraid. We're going home."

So the hearse ran out of gas
A passenger person grabbed a map
And the driver inside it contrived a new route to save the past
And checked his watch and grabbed a cab
A beautifully plain taxi cab
A cab, had it cleared out back and two men started to unpack

Driving once again
But now this time there were three men
And then I heard one of them say,
"I know the night will turn to gray
I know the stars will start to fade
When all the darkness fades away
We had to steal him from his fate
So he could see another day."

Then I cracked open my box
Someone must have picked the lock
A little light revealed the spot
Where my fingernails had fought
Then I pushed it open more
Pushing up against the door
Then I sat up off the floor
And found the breath I was searching for

Then there were three men up front
All I saw were backs of heads
And then I asked them, "Am I alive and well or am I dreaming dead?
And then one turned around to say,
"We're driving toward the morning sun
Where all your blood is washed away
And all you did will be undone."

I said, "Don't be afraid."---

Sometimes you gotta bleed to know
That you’re alive and have a soul
But it takes someone to come around
To show you how

She’s the tear in my heart
I’m alive
She’s the tear in my heart
I’m on fire
She’s the tear in my heart
Take me higher
Than I’ve ever been

The songs on the radio are okay
But my taste in music is your face
And it takes a song to come around
To show you how

She's the tear in my heart
I'm alive
She’s the tear in my heart
I’m on fire
She’s the tear in my heart
Take me higher
Than I’ve ever been
Than I’ve ever been
Than I’ve ever been
Than I’ve ever been

You fell asleep in my car I drove the whole time
But that’s okay I’ll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I’m driving here I sit
Cursing my government
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement
You fell asleep in my car I drove the whole time
But that’s okay I’ll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I’m driving here I sit
Cursing my government
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement
Sometimes you gotta bleed to know, oh, oh
That you’re alive and have a soul, oh, oh
But it takes someone to come around
To show you how

She’s the tear in my heart
I’m alive
She’s the tear in my heart
I’m on fire
She’s the tear in my heart
Take me higher
Than I’ve ever been
My heart is my armor
She’s the tear in my heart
She’s a carver
She’s a butcher with a smile
Cut me farther
Than I’ve ever been
Than I’ve ever been
Than I’ve ever been
Than I’ve ever been
My heart is my armor
She’s the tear in my heart
She’s a carver
She’s a butcher with a smile
Cut me farther
Than I’ve ever been---

I’m fairly local, I’ve been around 
I’ve seen the streets you're walking down 
I’m fairly local, good people now 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

I’m evil to the core 
What I shouldn't do I will 
They say I’m emotional 
What I wanna save I’ll kill 
Is that who I truly am? 
I truly don’t have a chance 
Tomorrow I’ll keep a beat 
And repeat yesterday’s dance 

Yo, this song will never be on the radio 
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote 
It’s the few, the proud, and the emotional 
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral 
The world around us is burning but we’re so cold 
It’s the few, the proud, and the emotional 

I’m fairly local, I’ve been around 
I’ve seen the streets you're walking down 
I’m fairly local, good people now 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I’m not evil to the core 
What I shouldn't do I will fight 
I know I’m emotional 
What I wanna save I will try 
I know who I truly am 
I truly do have a chance 
Tomorrow I’ll switch the beat 
To avoid yesterday’s dance 

Yo, this song will never be on the radio 
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote 
It’s the few, the proud, and the emotional 
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral 
The world around us is burning but we’re so cold 
It’s the few, the proud, and the emotional 

I’m fairly local, I’ve been around 
I’ve seen the streets you're walking down 
I’m fairly local, good people now 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I’m fairly local, I’ve been around 
I’ve seen the streets you're walking down 
I’m fairly local, good people now 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

Yeah 

I'm fairly local, good people now 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Good people now 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Good people now 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh---

Your grandpa died
When you were nine
They said he had
Lost his mind
You have learned
Way too soon
You should never trust the pantaloon

Now it's your turn
To be alone
Find a wife
And build yourself a home
You have learned
Way too soon
That your dad is now a pantaloon

You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize
The ground you walk
Lose your mind

He's seen too many stare downs
Between the sun and the moon
In the morning air
How he used to hustle all the people
Walking through the fairgrounds
He's been around so long
He's changed his meaning of a chair now
Because a chair now,
Is like a tiny island in the sea of all the people
Who glide across the very surface
That made his bones feeble
The end can't come soon enough
But is it too soon?
Either way he can't deny
He is a pantaloon

You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize
The ground you walk
Lose your mind

You like to sleep alone
It's colder than you know
Cause your skin is so
Used to colder bones
It's warmer in the morning
Than what it is at night
Your bones are held together
By your nightmare and your frights

You are tired
You are hurt
A moth ate through
Your favorite shirt
And all your friends fertilize
The ground you walk
Lose your mind---

I can't take them on my own, my own
Oh, I'm not the one you know, you know
I have killed a man and all I know
Is I am on the run and go.

Don't wanna call you in the nighttime
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight I'll need you to stay.

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do...

I am up against the wall, the wall
For I hear them coming down the hall
I have killed a man and all I know
Is I am on the run and go.

Don't wanna call you in the nighttime
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight I'll need you to stay.

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do...

Cold nights under siege from accusations
Cerebral thunder in one-way conversations
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.

Don't wanna call you in the nighttime
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight I'll need you to stay.

Tonight I'll need you to stay!---

He wakes up early today
Throws on a mask that will alter his face
Nobody knows his real name
But now he just uses one he saw on a grave

He pretends that he's okay
But you should see
Him in bed late at night, he's petrified
Take me out, and finish this waste of a life

Everyone gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
As you watch him fall through a bleeding trapdoor

He thinks that faith might be dead
Nothing kills a man faster than his own head
He used to see dreams at night
But now he's just watching the backs of his eyes

He pretends that he's okay
But you should see
Him in bed late at night, he's petrified
Take me out, and finish this waste of a life

Everyone gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
As you watch him fall through a bleeding trapdoor

Take me out, and finish this waste of a life

Everyone gather around for a show
Watch as this man disappears as we know
Do me a favor and try to ignore
When you watch him fall through a bleeding trapdoor
'Cause nobody knows he's alive---

I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And thats where I am
Silent in the trees.
Why won't you speak
Where I happen to be?
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly.

I can feel your breath.
I can feel my death.
I want to know you.
I want to see.
I want to say, hello. ---Lyrics submitted by Josh Alvarez.

Now the night is coming to an end,
The sun will rise and we will try again.

Stay alive, stay alive for me.
You will die, but now your life is free,
Take pride in what is sure to die.

I will fear the night again,
I hope I'm not my only friend.

Stay alive, stay alive for me.
You will die, but now your life is free,
Take pride in what is sure to die. ---Lyrics submitted by Josh Alvarez.

We don't believe what's on TV
Because it's what we want to see
And what we want we know we can't believe
We have all learned to kill our dreams

I need to know
That when I fail you'll still be here
Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair

I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you I might think twice

Alright, second verse
What if my dream does not happen?
Would I just change what I've told my friends?
Don't want to know who I would be
When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep

I need to know
That when I fail you'll still be here
Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
And we'll make money selling your hair

I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you I might think twice

I don't care what's in your hair
I just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old
But because of you I might think twice ---
