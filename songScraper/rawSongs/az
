AZ: 
yea, poet, politician, player when neccessary
this is AZ, im ya host for the evening,
its magic hour, how we gon do this

no stress we on the sands in tahiti
bare chest you bastards 30 grand on the pinky
respect finnesse rumors like the hands in grafitti
grey goose mixed with grape cran and the kiwi
its truth hoes galore pros go clothes galore
take paper till they close the door
either or gonna hustle or hustle on tour
done seen it all nothin left than to stumble or mourn
the sex, is fantazin' flow, campaigns him
dough, cant change him courts, cant arraign him it sports
titanium force iranian taught i came to inforce
all the bangers support
caught ya bang at ya fort
torch and tangle ya thoughts
scorch and stand if you're short so of course
its the chillin conversate kneel its the lamalate
millions im tryina chase iller from out the gate
get it right my feelings is not awake
ducati bikes is shipped from outta state
the pressure is on the blunts is lit
my presence is strong its real im amongst the mix
the wessen is long i move like im on some shit
so testin is wrong cos once guns is drawn thats it
the beef the rap the game is done
we leap we yap we smack we bang them guns
we beef with vests we strapped we came to come so
peace to that hes back nigga one

CL smooth:
yea chairman of the board man, black leader, the mecca don, el presidente
ladies and gentlemen

all i do is bring the light to a dead game the moment i came
under my umbrella my flag my name
if the ship leavin the port, cruise to the resort
you cant be serious baby, this is sport
got to make my rounds hit walls for this pack
till its ma and A steppin outta both sides of that maybach
we can eat lovely just dont interupt me
and mix all this checkmate with they quiet money
i can see it all bubblin the move is no troublin
ima give you the plug in to Sosa
they all love C.L no jail for homie
only gotta tell me one time dont fuck me tony
just buy weight fly straight and keep me right
and i dont care what i spend on security
it helps me sleep at night see nothin sharp as me
you takin it there you cant compare
to the initials engraved in my office chair
the boss is here deep in the game
cant do it the same gotta bring a strong leash for ya dame
i pop up speakin of cheddar me and son peakin together
cant feel its the real deal and lettin the meat ball
meet the berretta smellin like fresh cut leather
odd colour corbs sasparilla the curtains drawn
the seats vanilla let em see heat forever
takin that seat in powers all you want in this magic hour---Lyrics submitted by steve.
