Can you feel me
When I think about you
With every breath I take

Every minute
No matter what I do
My world is an empty place

Like I've been wonderin the desert
For a thousand days

Don't know if it's a mirage
But I always see your face, baby

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love

A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side

Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain

Whhoooaaa

The stars are burning
I hear your voice in my mind
Can't you hear me calling
My heart is yearning
Like the ocean that's running dry
Catch me I'm falling

It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet
Won't you save me

There's gonna be a monsoon
When you get back to me baby

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain

So let this drought come to an end
And may this desert flower again
And I need you here
I can't explain
But a day without you
Is like a year without rain

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain---Lyrics submitted by jj.

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh

Can you feel me
When I think about you?
With every breath I take
Every minute
No matter what I do

My world is an empty place
Like I've been wandering the desert
For a thousand days (oh)
Don't know if it's a mirage
But I always see your face, baby

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I'll survive
A day without you is like a year without rain (oh, whoa)
Whoa, oh, whoa

The stars are burning
I hear your voice in my mind (voice in my mind)
Can't you hear me calling?
My heart is yearning
Like the ocean that's running dry
Catch me, I'm falling

It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet
Won't you save me?
There's gonna be a monsoon when you get back to me, oh, baby

Whoa, oh, whoa

So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
I'm so glad you found me
Stick around me,
Baby baby baby oooh

It's a world of wonder with you in my life
So hurry, baby, don't waste no more time
I need you here, I can't explain
But a day without you is like a year without rain (oh, whoa)

I'm missing you so much
Can't help it, I'm in love
A day without you is like a year without rain

Di que sientes cuando pienso en ti una y otra vez
Cada instante, que no estás junto a mí
Mi mundo está al revés

Camino en un desierto cuando tú te vas
No sé si es un espejismo, te siento tan real, baby

[CHORUS]
Quiero volverte a ver, para calmar mi sed
Un día sin ti es como un año sin ver llover
Si esto pasa otra vez, no sobreviviré
Un día sin ti es como un año sin ver llover

Contando estrellas, oigo en mi mente tu voz
¿Oyes tu la mía?
Mi corazón esta sufriendo la soledad
Soy un desorden

Camino en hojas secas si no estás aquí, y mi vida
Regresa que un diluvio lloraré por ti

[CHORUS]
Quiero volverte a ver, para calmar mi sed
Un día sin ti es como un año sin ver llover
Si esto pasa otra vez, no sobreviviré
Un día sin ti es como un año sin ver llover

Regresa aquí, abrázame
Soy un desierto sin tu querer
Vuelve pronto a mí, no seas así porque
Un día sin ti es como un año sin ver llover

[CHORUS]
Quiero volverte a ver, para calmar mi sed
Un día sin ti es como un año sin ver llover
Si esto pasa otra vez, no sobreviviré
Un día sin ti es como un año sin ver llover ---Lyrics submitted by selena.

I was lookin in the mirror 
tryin to find a new reflection wanna take the road lets travel down 
a different direction make some new mistakes 
forget the one's i made 
cry some tears of joy and dress more like a boy 
i come as a blonde try a every lipstick on, 
as a blonde, will I get whatever I want? 
I’d be ever so incising, take a lot of icing, never have to watch my weight. 
Yeah when I’m gone, 
I’m gonna come back as a blonde. 

I wanna I meet myself, 
as someone else, 
just to see what it feels like. 
Take a walk, 
on the other side, 
cause you know that I just might. 
Break some different hearts, 
finish what i start. 
I’m not gonna wait, 
and mess around with fate. 

(Chorus) 
And come back as a blonde, 
try a every lipstick on, 
as a blonde, will I get whatever I want? 
I’d be ever so incising, take a lot of icing, never have to watch my weight. 
When I’m gone, 
I’m gonna come back as a ... 

(Bridge) 
I’m tainted, I’m tired, of being the same yeah. 
I’m desperate, I’m bored, I’m begging for change. 
What if you’re normal and wanna be strange? 
Come back, come back, come back. 
I wanna come back, come back, come back. 

(Chorus) 
As a blonde, try a every lipstick on, 
as a blonde, will I get whatever I want? 
I’d be ever so incising, take a lot of icing, never have to watch my weight. 
Yeah when I’m gone, 
I’m gonna come back as a blonde. 
Wave my magic wand, 
as a blonde, will I get whatever I want? 
I’d be ever so incising, down a lot of ice cream, never need to wash my face. 
Yeah when I’m gone, 
I’m gonna... 
Come back, come back, come back. (i'm Gonna come back) 
Come back, come back, come back. (I'm Gonna come back) 
Come back, come back, come back.

It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face
It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face

Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face,
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face

Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face,
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face

I'm a make you bend your back
Oh my God this beat is crack
When I do this, you do that

I feel like dancing when I hear that sound
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh
I feel like dancing when I hear that sound
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh

It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face
It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand
And the beat in my face

Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face,
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face

Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face,
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face

I'm a bring the party back

When I do this, you do that

I feel like dancing when I hear that sound
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh
I feel like dancing when I hear that sound
Just wanna do it, eh, just wanna do it, eh

And the beat in my face
It's a big bad world but I ain't ashamed to like the lights in my hand
And the beat, beat, beat, beat...

Automatic, dance-natic, I can get enough
I can get enough, I can get enough, of that beat in my face

Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face,
The lights in my hand, and the beat in my face
Be-be-beat in my face, be-be-beat in my face,

I'm going in, I'm ready to surrender
Like a diamond, I need a little pressure
So press me down till I scream
If you're the flame, I'm kerosene
I'm burning up, baby

All I need, all I need is your body heat
Right next to me
All I need, all I need is your body heat
Oh my God it feels amazing when you hold me close
Know me like the summer, baby don't let go

I got body heat
(I'm burning up, baby)
Got body heat
(All I want is your body)
Got body heat
Burn it up, burn it up
So give it up, give it up
All I need, all I need is your body heat

I'm restless, I'm craving your attention
My red lips have found a new obsession
Let's go all night, just you and me
If you're the flame, I'm kerosene
I'm burning up, baby

All I need, all I need is your body heat
Right next to me
All I need, all I need is your body heat
Oh my God it feels amazing when you hold me close
Know me like the summer, baby don't let go

I got body heat
(I'm burning up, baby)
Got body heat
(All I want is your body)
Got body heat
Burn it up, burn it up
So give it up, give it up
All I need, all I need is your body heat

All I need, all I need is your body heat
Right next to me
All I need, all I need is your body heat
Right next to me

I'm burning up, burning up, you're right there
Your body heat right next to me
I'm burning up, burning up, you're right there
Your body heat right next to me
We're connected by the sun
And all of the stars above
You melt me and my body feels no shame
And I don't care tonight
If it burns too bright
Cause baby, that's why I came

All I need, all I need is your body heat
Right next to me
All I need, all I need is your body heat
Oh my God it feels amazing when you hold me close
Know me like the summer, baby don't let go

I got body heat
(I'm burning up, baby)
Got body heat
(All I want is your body)
Got body heat
Burn it up, burn it up
So give it up, give it up
All I need, all I need is your body heat---

Dead-end streets and boulevards
You threw in the towel, I broke your heart
But there's a first time for everything
Who would've thought you'd feel so cold
And all these memories seem so old
To think you were my everything

Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

Riding alone on the 405
And life's so fragile, it's like I could cry
If that's the last time I'd see you again
But I'll never tell you just how I felt
You might just not care, and it might just not help
What if the feelings just don't make no sense to you, you

Remember when we'd talk all night
But time ain't easy on us, how can love die?

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride

I got so much shit to say
But I can't help feeling like I'm camouflage
Fortress around my heart
You were mine just yesterday
Now I have no idea who you are
It's like you camouflage

But it's good to see you here again
I don't wanna say goodbye
But it's about half past ten
And I have to catch my ride---

I guess I should've known 
It wasn't gonna end okay, 
You're such a trouble maker 
But I like you just that way. 

A bomb tick ticking with  
Neither one of to blame
Just like a count down 
 Ready to blow 
I sat around a lot and thought 
About the world without you 
And no matter what you think, 
Everything is not about you 
You think I'm still hung up on you 
But, baby it's not true 
Now look at me 
Your memories turn to dust 
There's only one explanation 
I wasn't really in love 
I wasn't really in love 
It was just a crush 
It was just a crush 
Sparks fly when we touch 
It was never enough 
It was just a crush 
It was just a crush 
Yeah 
You found one the things you need 
There's nothing left to lose 
The things I never wanna be 
I owe it all to you 
You just can't help yourself 
It's what you do 
'Cause this is real life 
Not your show 

Now look at me 
The memories turn to dust 
There's only one explanation 
I wasn't really in love 
I wasn't really in love 
It was just a crush 
It was just a crush 
Sparks fly when we touch 
It was never enough 
It was just a crush 
It was just a crush 
Yeah 

You'll be fine, 
Just find another girl 
To kick around 
Won't be long 
Until they all know what 
I figured out 

Now look at me 
The memories turn to dust 
There's only one explanation 
I wasn't really in love 
(I wasn't really in love) 
It was just a crush 
(It just was a crush) 
Sparks fly when we touched 
It was never enough 
It was just a crush 
It was just a crush (It was just a crush) 
Yeah

It was just a crush 
Yeah.---Lyrics submitted by Lydia.

Yo no quiero ser otra persona.

[Estribillo]
¿Quién dice que
¿Quién dice que no eres perfecto
¿Quién dice que no vales la pena
¿Quién dice que es el único que está perjudicando
Confía en mí
Ese es el precio de la belleza
¿Quién dice que no está muy
¿Quién dice que no eres hermosa---Lyrics submitted by breanna.

Nada que temer, nada que cambiar.

Por ti me olvidé de quién yo era en realidad,
Contigo me quedé, como un diamante sin brillar.
No quiero ser así, espejo de tu vanidad,
Prefiero ser de mí
sin nada que temer, nada que cambiar.

Na na na
Yo me siento así,
Bella y auténtica.
Na na na
No seré por ti,
Una flor de metal, no no!

Dices, que soy imperfecta,
que tu eres mi dueño,
Quien no te madura todo el tiempo.
Dices que hablo cosas tontas,
Que no te merezco,
Quien te crees que eres, dime quién.

Te pido por favor,
Que no me quieras controlar,
Entrégame tu amor,
Sin condiciones nada más.
Permíteme vivir, soñando ésta realidad,
No ves que soy así, distinta sin igual.

Na na na
Yo me siento así,
Bella y auténtica.
Na na na
No seré por ti,
Una flor de metal, no no!

Dices, que soy imperfecta,
que tu eres mi dueño,
Quien no te madura todo el tiempo.
Dices que hablo cosas tontas,
Que no te merezco,
Quien te crees que eres, dime quién.

Dices que soy una niña,
Que me tienen consentida.
Dices que soy diferente,
Ciertamente, ciertamente.
Soy lo que me gusta ser,
No me intentes detener.
Mírame bien, no estoy hecha de papel.
Dices!

Dices, que soy imperfecta,
que tu eres mi dueño,
Quien no te madura todo el tiempo.
Dices que hablo cosas tontas,
Que no te merezco,
Quien te crees que eres, dime quién.

que soy imperfecta,
que tu eres mi dueño,
Quien no te madura todo el tiempo.
Dices que hablo cosas tontas,
Que no te merezco,
Quien te crees que eres, dime quién.---Lyrics submitted by Paige Johnson.

Sitting on my bed with just a t-shirt on
Turning up the volume to my favorite song
Boy I can't lie
What we did last night
You know it's constantly replaying, staying on my mind

I'll show you want I like boy boy boy,
If you show me what you like boy boy boy,
I'll show you what I like,
Show you what I like like,
If you show me what you like boy

If I had choice
If I had my way
Boy you know we'd do it every single day
If I had a wish
And If I had my way
Boy you know we'd do it every single day

Damn
Wish I didn't feel so hypnotized,
But When I look at you baby it's justified,
So I take what I want,
And give what I got,
To help with all the rules that keep us civilized

I'll show you want I like boy boy boy,
If you show me what you like boy boy boy,
I'll show you what I like,
Show you what I like like,
If you show me what you like boy

If I had choice
If I had my way
Boy you know we'd do it every single day
If I had a wish
And If I had my way
Boy you know we'd do it every single day

No where I'd rather be
Than anywhere alone, just you and me
I'll be too gentle, you'll be my Clyde
We'll be together forever we'll ride
I want you more and more
You gotta take that and the day before
No lie, no lie, no lie, no lie

If I had choice
If I had my way
Boy you know we'd do it every single day
If I had a wish
And If I had my way
Boy you know we'd do it every single day

I'll show you want I like boy boy boy,
If you show me what you like boy boy boy,
I'll show you what I like,
Show you what I like like,
If you show me what you like boy---

Well you know everything gonna be a breeze
At the end will no doubt justify the means
You can fix any problem with the slightest ease
(Yes please)

But you might find out it'll go to your head
When you write a report, on a book you've never read
And with the snap of your fingers, you can make your bed!
(That's what I said)

Everything is not what it seems
When you can get what you wanted in your wildest dreams
You might run into trouble if you go to extremes
Because everything is not what it seems

Everything is not what it seems,
When you can have all you want by the simplest of means
Be careful not to mess with the balance of things
Because everything is not....what it seems ---Lyrics submitted by alafe.

You walk and talk
Like you're some new sensation
You move in circles
You don't need an invitation
You spend your money
You can't get no satisfaction
You play it right
So you can get the right reaction

It won't be long, my darling
Pick up the phone
Nobody's on it
Where are your friends now, baby
Aren't they the ones
Supposed to be there for

You, and you're falling down
The world starts spinning out
You, and you're falling down
No, it's not all about
You, and you're falling down
You know I'll be around
When you're falling down
Falling down

Falling down
You're falling down
You're falling down

What's out of place
When you look into the mirror
The truth is blurry
But the lies are getting clearer
Your eyes are fixed
Your smile is so elastic
You gave me roses
But they're all just made of plastic

It won't be long, my darling 
Pick up the phone
Nobody's on it
Where are your friends now, baby
Aren't they the ones
Supposed to be there for

You, and you're falling down
The world starts spinning out
You, and you're falling down
No, it's not all about
You, and you're falling down
You know I'll be around
When you're falling down
Falling

Smile for the camera
Everybody's looking at you
Smile for the camera
If they're all about to trash you
Smile for the camera
(Camera, camera)
Smile for the camera
Who's gonna catch you

You
(You)

You, and you're falling down
The world starts spinning out
You, and you're falling down
No, it's not all about
You, when you're falling down
You know I'll be around
When you're falling down
Falling

Smile for the camera
Everybody's looking at you
Smile for the camera
If they're all about to trash you---Lyrics submitted by Y.

Watch all the flowers
Dance with the wind
Listen to snowflakes
Whisper your name
Feel all the wonder
Lifting your dreams
You can fly
(Fly)

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly
To your heart

Touch every rainbow
Painting the sky
Look at the magic
Glide through your life
A sprinkle of pixie dust circles the night
You can fly

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly

Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings
Fly
You can fly
To your heart
(Fly, fly)

Rise to the heights of all you can be
(Fly, Fly)
Soar on the hope of marvelous things

(Key Change!)
Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
You believe you'll find your wings
Fly

Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings
Fly
You can fly
To your heart ---Lyrics submitted by Jessica White.

I told, I told, I told myself again
I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but you're so...
Far away, so far away

Won't listen to the conscience in my head
I'm conscious but I'm lonely, halfway dead
Tired of the things you never...
You never said, you never said

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

I know, I know, I know we can't pretend
That we were never lovers in the end
I try to tell myself this pain would...
Go away...just go away!

Our love was made to rule the world
You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love was made to rule the world
You left me wanting what we were
Our love was made to rule the world

Forget forever
Forget forever
Forget you ever
Knew my name, my name, my name, my name

Forget forever
Forget forever ---

I told, I told, I told myself again
I'm never running back on what I said
Trying not to roam but you're so...
Far away, so far away

Won't listen to the conscience in my head

Tired of the things you never...
You never said, you never said

You came and broke the perfect girl
Our love was made to rule the world

Our love was made to rule the world

Turn my back to the door 
Feel so much better now 
Don’t even try anymore 
Nothin’ left to lose

As the voice that’s in the air 
Sayin’ don’t look back no where 
Theres a voice that’s always there

And I’ll never be quite the same as I was before 
This part of you still remains oh it’s out of focus

Your just somewhere that I’ve been 
And I won’t go back again 
Your just somewhere that I’ve been
I’m breathin’ in, breathin’ out 
Ain’t that what its all about? 
Livin’ life crazy loud

Like I have the right to 
No more words in my mouth 
Nothin’ left to figure out 
That I don’t think I’ll ever break through 
The ghost of you 
And I’ll never be like I was the day I met you 
To naive? Yes I was 
Boy, that’s why I let you in

Wear your memory like a stain 
Can’t erase none of the pain 
Here to stay with me forever

Breathin’ in, breathin’ out 
Ain’t that what it’s all about? 
Livin’ life crazy loud

Like I have the right to 
No more words in my mouth 
Nothin’ left to figure out 
That I don’t think I’ll ever break through 
The ghost of you
One of these days 
I’ll wake up from this bad dream I’m dreamin’ 
One of these days I pray that I’ll be, over,over,over you 
One of these days I’ll realize that I’m to tired of

Feelin’ confused 
But for now there’s a reason 
That you’re still here in my heart 
Breathin’ in, breathin’ out 
Ain’t that what it’s all about? 
Livin’ life crazy loud

Like I have the right to 
Know the words in my mouth 
Nothin’ left for me to doubt 
That I don’t think I’ll ever break through 
The ghost of you

Breathin’ in , breathin’ out 
Breathin’ in, breathin’ out 
Like I have the right to

No more words in my mouth 
Nothin’ left to figure out 
But I don’t think I’ll ever break through 
The the ghost of you---

I'm on my 14 carats
I'm 14 carat
Doing it up like Midas
Now you say I got a touch
So good, so good
Make you never wanna leave
So don't, so don't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

I'm on my marquise diamonds
I'm a marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany jealous
You say I give it to you hard
So bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave
I won't, I won't

Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to how you're breathing

Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I

Hold on, take a minute, love
Cause I ain't trying to mess your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to mess your fitness up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, the signature
Any time I hit it, know she feelin' for it through
And any time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next chick
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad miss without the ass shots
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?

Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Baby, let me be good to you, good to you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you

Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I---

Can't keep my hands to myself
No matter how hard I'm trying to
I want you all to myself
Your metaphorical gin and juice
So come on, give me a taste
Of what it's like to be next to you
Won't let one drop go to waste
Your metaphorical gin and juice

Ohh cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, but I

Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

The doctor say you're no good
But people say what they wanna say
And you should know if I could
I'd breathe you in every single day

Ohh cause all of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
All of the downs and the uppers
Keep making love to each other
And I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, but I

Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself

Can't keep my hands to myself
I want it all, know nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Oh, I, I want it all
I want it all, I want it all
Can't keep my hands to myself
I mean I could, but why would I want to?

My hands to myself
Can't keep my hands to myself
My hands to myself
Can't keep, keep my hands to myself
I want it all, know nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself
Give me your all and nothing else
Can't keep my hands to myself---

It's the boy you never told "I like you"
It's the girl you let get away
It's the one you saw that day on the train
but you freaked out and walked away

It's the plane you wanna catch to Vegas
things you swear you'll do before you die
It's the city of love that waits for you
but your too damn scared to fly

chorus: 
Hit the lights
let the music move you
lose yourself tonight
come alive
let the moment take you
lose control tonight (x2)

It's the time that you totally screwed up
still you're trying to get it out your brain
It's the fight you had when you didn't make up
It's the past you're dying to change

It's all the money that you're saving
while the good life passes by
It's all the dreams that never came true
cause your too damn scared to try

chorus (x2)

It's a mad mad world
gotta make an escape
It's a perfect world
when you go all the way

hit the lights
let the music move you
lose yourself tonight

So let's go go go go
all the way
yeah let's go go go go
night and day
from the floor to the rafters
people raise your glasses
we could dance forever

Verse 1:
It doesn't hurt when i think of you, 
And all the things we'll never get to do. 
I don't dream at night about the way we were.
I tore up the pictures and crossed out all the words. 
Don't be fooled right on my tears cause everything is fine,
And you can pick up all the pieces that you left behind.

Chorus:
Cause i never think about you, I'm better off with out you.
I don't miss you at all, I don't miss you at all. 
You don't spin around in my head, It's like you never existed.
And i hope you don't call, I don't miss you at all. 
And i'm not trying to fight it, no i'm not trying to fight it. 
So you can cross my name right off the wall.
I don't miss you at all. 

Verse 2:
I go out 7 nights a week, It feels good to finally be free.
And i party like a never did before, what in the world what was I waiting for?
Everything is perfect now without you in my life.
You can pick up all the pieces that you left behind. 

Chorus:
Cause i never think about you I'm better off without you.
I don't miss you at all, I don't miss you at all. 
You don't spin around in my head, It's like you never existed.
And I hope you don't call, I don't miss you at all. 
And I'm not trying to fight it, no I'm not trying to fight it. 
So you can cross my name right off the wall.
I don't miss you at all. 
I don't miss you at all.
I don't miss you at all.,

Bridge:
I'll just tell myself we'll forget the past, 
No time for regrets, no more looking back. 
I'll forgive you more every single day.
Every step i take is getting better.

Chorus:
Cause i never think about you, I'm better off without you. 
I don't miss you at all, I don't miss you at all you. 
Don't spin around in my head, Its like you never existed. 
And I hope you don't call, and I don't miss you at all. 
And I'm not trying to fight it, no I'm not trying to fight it. 
So you can cross my name right off the wall. 
I don't miss you at all.
I don't miss you.
I don't miss you.---Lyrics submitted by Chelsea.

I picked you out of in a crowd
Of a thousand faces
Yeah, I found you, oo, oo, oo
I chose the whys and the whens
All around and places
Yeah, I chose you, oo, oo, oo

I let you see me
Let you believe it was your move
So smooth, my rules

Well, you think you are the one
Who got me, boy
No, I got U
I've been playing with you
Like a little toy
Yeah, I got U
I got U
I got U

You'd be surprised all the
Times that I almost told you
But I stayed cool, ohhh
I almost broke, but
I knew I would get to hold you
Cause I'm no fool, ohhh

You came back to me
And did the very thing I knew
That you'd do, oh oo oh

Well, you think you are the one
Who got me, boy
No, I got U

I know that my love for you is real
It's something true that we do
Just something natural that I feel
When you walk in the room, when you're near
I feel my heart skip a beat
The whole world disappears
And there's just you and me
Falling head over feet
Let's take a chance together

I know [4x]
We gonna make it
'Cause no one else can make me feel
The way that you do
I promise you
I know [4x]
We gonna get there
Today tomorrow and forever
We will stay true
I promise you

They say that we're just too young
To know
But I'm sure heart and soul
That I am never letting you go
When it's right it's right
And this is it
'Cause I'm walking on air
Every single time that we kiss
You make the angels sing
You give that songbird wings
You make everything better

I know [4x]
We gonna make it
'Cause no one else can make me feel
The way that you do
I promise you
I know [4x]
We gonna get there
Today tomorrow and forever
We will stay true

I'll never let you down
I'll always hear you out
There is nothing you cannot confide
You listen when I speak
You make my knees go weak
And I just want you by my side

I’m sorry for changing  I’m sorry it had to be this way believe me its easier just to pretend but I wont apologize for who I am (no, no)
remember the time when you said you were out with your best friend but it wasn’t the best friend that you know i thought you meant and i used to accept it, I didn’t know I could be free but I am and I wont go back 'cause you so don’t deserve me    I don’t even want to be her

[chorus]                              
I’m sorry for changing I’m sorry it had to be this way  believe me its easier just to pretend but I wont apologize for who I am I thank you for this hopeless war because through the pain I am a lot stronger than before and now I’m on I don’t need you anymore I’m sorry  

listen close I wont say this again I’m sorry for changing I’m sorry it had to be this way believe me its easier just to pretend but I wont apologize for who I am I’m sorry for changing I’m sorry it isn’t like it was believe me its easier just to pretend but I wont apologize, why should I apologize, no i wont apologize for who I am---Lyrics submitted by Jasmine.

The world can be a nasty place
You know it, I know it, yeah
We don't have to fall from grace
Put down the weapons you fight with

Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

We're running out of time
Chasing our lies
Everyday a small piece of you dies
Always somebody
You're willing to fight, to be right

Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
And no war and anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you're fighting

Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now

Your lies are bullets
Your mouth's a gun
No war and anger
Was ever won
Put out the fire before igniting
Next time you're fighting

Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Kill 'em with kindness
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead now

Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now
Go ahead, go ahead now---

If time could tune in today and we left too many things to say
If we could turn it back what would we want to change? but now’s the time to take a chance
C’mon, we got to make a stand
What if we gotta lose the choices in our hands
And we can find a way to do anything if we try to

Live like there’s no tomorrow, (cause all we have is here right now)
Love like it’s all that we know. (The only chance that we ever found)
Believe in what we feel inside, Believe in it and it’ll never die.
So never let this life pass us by.
Live like there’s no tomorrow.

It never was a night at day and then the week will fade away
Let it be. nothing less. and let the dreams remain.
Take a leap and fade and hope you fly, feel what it’s like to be alive
Give it all, what we’ve got and lay it all on the line
And we can find a way to do anything if we try to

Live like there’s no tomorrow, (cause all we have is here right now)
Love like it’s all that we know. (The only chance that we ever found)
Believe in what we feel inside, Believe in it and it’ll never die.
So never let this life pass us by.
Live like there’s no tomorrow.

Will you be by my side? We’ll do this together.
Just you and Me. Nothing is impossible. Nothing is impossible!

Live like there’s no tomorrow, (cause all we have is here right now)
Love like it’s all that we know. (The only chance that we ever found)
Believe in what we feel inside, Believe in it and it’ll never die.
So never let this musicjuzz.blogspot.com life pass us by
Live like there’s no tomorrow.

Live like there’s no tomorrow, (cause all we have is here right now)
Love like it’s all that we know. (The only chance that we ever found)

[Voicemail:]
Hey babe it's me, I just wanted to call to tell you that
I love you so so so so much,
Just wanted to let you know that you are my princess,
You are worthy of all of the love in the world,
You are the love of my life.

Now's all we got,
And time can't be bought,
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember

[Verse 1:]
You said you loved me,
I said I loved you back,
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

All your promises,
And all them plans we had,
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

Boom gone,
Yeah we move on
Even if we try to forget

[Chorus:]
Love will remember you,
Love will remember me,
I know it inside my heart,
Forever will, forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember [x5]

[Verse 2:]
The trips we dream of takin',
The tags left on the map,
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

When all you had was nothing,
When all we did was laugh,
What happened? what happened?
What happened to that?

Boom gone,
Yeah we move on
Even if we try to forget

[Chorus:]
Love will remember [x5]

[Bridge:]
Break down the walls,
Let heaven in,
Somewhere in forever
We'll dance again,
We used to be inseparable,
I used to think that I was irreplaceable,
We lit the whole world up,
Before we blew it up,
I just don't know how we screwed it up
Forever [x3]

[Chorus:]
Love will remember [x4]---

It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now, here's another one
So your melody will play on and on, with the best of ‘em
You are beautiful, like a dream come alive, incredible
A center full of miracle, lyrical, you saved my life again
And I want you to know, baby

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting re-pe-pe-pe-peat
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting re-pe-pe-pe-peat

Constantly, boy you play through my mind like a symphony
There's no way to describe what you do to me
You just do to me what you do and it feels like I've been rescued
I've been set free, I am hypnotized by your destiny
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful, you are
And I want you to know, baby

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting re-pe-pe-pe-peat
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting re-pe-pe-pe-peat

No one compares, you stand alone
To every record I own, music to my heart
That's what you are, a song that goes on and on

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting re-pe-pe-pe-peat
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I love you, like a love song---Lyrics submitted by Ida'Nathalie.

In the dark we can see
Feel your hand touching me
Run away from the world outside we know
In your lips I confide
In our love we can hide
Run away from our world outside we know

And when I waken next to you
I know we're not the lonely people that we used to be
I'm never giving up on this
The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart
You're taking on me like I'm taking on you
And it's my favorite part
Don't let go, don't let go tonight
And you can't stop my heart
The lover in me is the lover in you

'Cause we fit perfectly when you lay over me
Run away from the world outside we know

And when I waken next to you
I know we're not the lonely people that we used to be
I'm never giving up on this
The lover in me is the lover in you
And you can't stop my heart

(Quiero Más)

Cae la noche yo a tu lado
Viendo estrellas que al brillar
Nos invitan a soñar
No tengamos tanto miedo
Que al mostrar nuestro querer
Nada nos podrá vencer

Tú y yo seremos la pareja ideal
Y juntos volaremos hasta el más haya

Tú y yo libres como el viento
Tú y yo hasta el firmamento
Arriésgate y vera que pronto pedirás
Más más más
Tu y yo dos sobrevivientes
Tú y yo siempre indiferentes
Que importa el que dirán
Contigo quiero estar
Más, más, más

Ven y dime al oído
Que no puedes ya vivir
Sin estar cerca de mí
Siente todos mis latidos
Son más fuerte cada vez
Te adueñaste de mí ser

Tú y yo seremos la pareja ideal
Y juntos volaremos hasta el más haya
Tú y yo libres como el viento
Tú y yo hasta el firmamento
Arriésgate y veras
Que pronto pedirás
Más, más, más
Tu y yo dos sobrevivientes
Tú y yo siempre indiferentes
Que importa el qué dirán
Contigo quiero estar
Más, más, más

Vámonos de fiesta y bailemos hasta que amanezca
Sí la noche es corta no me importa pienso disfrutarla
Quiero Más Más y Más
Tú y yo libres como el viento
Tú y yo hasta el firmamento
Arriésgate y veras
Que pronto pedirás más
Más más
Tú y yo dos sobrevivientes
Tú y yo siempre indiferentes
Que importa el qué dirán
Contigo estar
Más, más, más

Quiero más

Drop down on a desert ride
Just outside the 95
Never felt more, more alive
I got my chicas by my side

If we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way
You don't understand
I don't need a man

Me and my girls, me and my girls
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my girls
Me and my girls, me and my girls
No jodas, nosotras
Me and my girls
Me and my girls

The night is dark but the moon is bright
We're staring at this summer night
Tan skin looks damn good in white
Stripping down by the Hollywood sign

If we want it, we take it
If we need money, we make it
Nobody knows if we fake it
You like to watch while we shake it
I know we're making you thirsty
You want us all in the worst way

Ooh, all the rhythm takes you over
Takes you to a different place
A different space
Ooh, the smoke is getting closer
I can feel our young blood race
Through cityscapes

And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do it's stuff
'Til the energy is too much

Yeah all I need
Is the rhythm, me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah the rhythm, me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
I know, I know, I know
I'd be lying
If I said I didn't need
Yeah the rhythm, me and the rhythm

Ooh, I start to feel it now
Feeling like I'm truly free
I'm free in me
Ooh, the heat's a common ground
No matter what's your history
Be free with me

And everybody wants to be touched
Everybody wants to get some
But don't you play a song about love
When I move my body
I don't have to talk about none
Let the chemicals do it's stuff
'Til the energy is too much

Yeah all I need
Is the rhythm, me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah the rhythm, me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know

If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark
If you feel like you're the spark
Then come out of the dark

Yeah all I need
Is the rhythm, me and the rhythm
Nothing between
Yeah the rhythm, me and the rhythm
And I know, I know, I know
I can't fight it
I won't, I won't, I won't
Deny it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
I'd be lying

You left me spinning like a disco
Trying but I don't know
If it can stand straight
You took me, left, when you knew I was right
And now I gotta fight just to make it through the day

I never knew what you were capable of
Baby, I would've kept my heart
But I gave it up
Baby, I fell in love
Now I don't know what it's done

[Chorus]
It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Now I'm lost
Trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this,
Alone but now I'm walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere

You left me broken like a record
Baby, I'm hurt and I don't want to play anymore
Missed every sign
Believed ever lie
And I was waiting for more

I never knew what you were capable of
Baby, I would've kept my heart
But I gave it up
Baby, I fell in love
Now I don't know what it's done

[Chorus]
It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Now I'm lost
Trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this,
Alone but now I'm walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere

You took my heart off my sleeve
But now I'm taking it back, back
Baby, here I come
You took advantage of me
I don't appreciate that, that
You son of a gun

It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere

[Chorus]
It's so cold with nobody to hold me
You're so wrong leaving when you told me
You would never leave me by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere
Now I'm lost
Trying to make it on my own
I thought I could never do this,
Alone but now I'm walking by myself
Out in the middle of nowhere---Lyrics submitted by hannah.

Friday night and we're just talking
Stars are crashing in the sky
Burning just for you and I 

We don't need to over think this
Nothing is going to bring us down
Show them what we're all about

All the way, one hundred one percent touch down
We're gonna kill it, lead the pack 
Gon' take this town

Let's go, what you wanna wait for?
Let's take everything we ask for
Come on and turn it up
Let's tell them what we want

Come on and let it play
Let me hear you say

Take my hand and pull me closer
Whisper nothings in my ear
Till the walls just disappear

Feel the music

Feel my heart beat like a drum

All I need is love
That's what you give, I'm taking it tonight
All I need is touch
That's what I feel when your skin's on mine

And with you the music is better
Just want us to be together, 24/7
And now that the color's brighter
Cause you set me up on fire

The music feels better with you
So much better with you
The music feels better with you

All I need is true
That's what you are
When everything's alright

Just want us to be together, 24/7
And now that the color's brighter

You make me so upset sometimes
I feel like I could lose my mind
The conversation goes nowhere
Cause you never gonna take me there
And I know what I know
And I know you’re no good for me
Yeah, I know what I know
And I know it’s not meant to be

Here’s my dilemma, one half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My, my, my dilemma, from the moment I met ya
I just can’t get you outta my head
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted, to my dilemma
My dilemma, it’s you, it’s you

Your eyes have told a thousand lies
But I believe them when they look in mine
I heard the rumors, but you won’t come clean
I guess I’m hoping it’s because of me
And I know what I know
And I know you’re no good for me
Yeah, I know what I know
And I know it’s not meant to be

Here’s my dilemma, one half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My, my, my dilemma, from the moment I met ya
I just can’t get you outta my head
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted, to my dilemma
My dilemma, it’s you, it’s you

I could live without you, your smile, your eyes
The way you make me feel inside
I could live without you, but I don’t wanna
I don’t wanna, oh, oh
You make me so upset sometimes

Here’s my dilemma, one half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My, my, my dilemma, from the moment I met ya
I just can’t get you outta my head
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted, to my dilemma
My dilemma, it’s you, it’s you, it’s you, it’s you
It’s you, it’s you, it’s you, it’s you
It’s you, it’s you, it’s
My, my, my dilemma---Lyrics submitted by Ida'Nathalie.

You make me so upset sometimes
I feel like I could lose my mind
The conversation goes nowhere
'cause you're never gonna take me there

And I know, what I know
And I know you're no good for me
Yeah I know, what I know
And I know it's not meant to be

Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head

And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma
My dilemma, it's you, it's you
Your eyes have told a thousand lies
But I believe them when they look in mine

My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head

And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma
My dilemma, it's you, it's you

One day I want you and then I don't.
I'm gonna leave you and then I won't.
I can't live with or without you
I can't live with or without you.

Here's my dilemma
One half of me wants ya
And the other half wants to forget
My-my-my dilemma
From the moment I met ya
I just can't get you out of my head
(Can't get you out of my)
And I tell myself to run from you
But I find myself attracted to my dilemma,
My dilemma, it's you, it's you

It's you, it's you, it's you, it's you (it's you...)
It's you, it's you, it's you

How you choose to express yourself 
It's all your own and I can tell 
It comes naturally, it comes naturally 

You follow what you feel inside 
It's intuitive, you don't have to try 
It comes naturally, mmmm it comes naturally 

And it takes my breath away 

You are the thunder and I am the lightening 
And I love the way you know who you are 
And to me it's exciting 
When you know its meant to be 
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally 
When you're with me, baby 
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally 
Bay bay baby 

You have a way of moving me 
A force of nature, your energy 
It comes naturally (You know it does) 
It comes naturally 
Mmmm yeah 

And it takes my breath away (Everytime) 
What you do, so naturally 

You are the thunder and I am the lightening 
And I love the way you know who you are

When you know its meant to be 
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally 
When you're with me, baby 
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally 
Bay bay baby 

When we collide, sparks fly 
When you look in my eyes, it takes my breath away 

(You are) 
You are the thunder and I am the lightening 
And I love the way you know who you are 
And to me it's exciting 
When you know its meant to be 
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally 
When you're with me, baby 
Everything comes naturally, it comes naturally

No heart, no hands, no skin, no touch
Can get me there, nowhere enough
To love me like you do, to love me like you do
No kiss, no lips, no feel, no rush
Can keep me high, I swear no one
Can love me like you do, can love me like you do, oh

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh
Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's ever loved me to the truth
Like you, ooh

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, nobody ooh

No oxygen, could barely breathe
My darkest sin, you've raised release
And it's all because of you, all because of you
I don't know what it is, but you've pulled me in
No one compares, could ever begin
To love me like you do
Hmm I wouldn't want them to
Cause...

Nobody's gonna love me like you
Nobody, uh
Nobody, no uh
Nobody's gonna love me like you do
Like you, ooh

You've been riding this horse a long time
Why can't you find what you where looking for?
Always greener on the other side
Always believe there must be something more

Never stay very long anywhere
As the next girl you leave gets smaller
In you raer-view mirror

(Chorus)
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love

You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love

If you tear her world apart
You have no regrets
If there´s a key to your heart
No one has found it yet

You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love

Your reputaton's gettin out of control
I can believe, she believe's one word you say
Before I let you take my girlfriend home
I've got to warn her about the price on your head

It must feel so alone out there
Always running away from someone
But you get nowhere

(Chorus)
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love

You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love

If you tear her world apart
You have no regrets
If there´s a key to your heart
No one has found it yet

You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love

(Bridge)
I'm from the Lone Star State
I'm ready to bring you in
(Oh..)

I'm gonna see your face make you pay for all of your sins
Oh...Oh, oh

You've been riding this horse a long time
I´ve had my eye on you all night
I´m gonna find a way to make you mind
I know, even though

(Chorus)
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love

You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love

If you tear her world apart
You have no regrets
If there´s a key to your heart
No one has found it yet

You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw
You're in outlaw running from love

Stop running!---Lyrics submitted by hannah.

Different inflection when you say my name
Kiss me, but your kiss don't taste the same
Is it real or am I going out of my mind?
Curious 'bout the company that you keep
Cause I hear you talking 'bout her in your sleep
And now you've got me talking 'bout her in mine

Ooh, and I bet she has it all
Bet she's beautiful like you, like you
And I bet she's got that touch
Makes you fall in love, like you, like you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect
And she's perfect

How does she touch you? Can I try it, too?
I know you're twisted, but baby, I'm twisted, too
I wanna know how she could make a man lose his mind

With the smell of her perfume
I could love her, too, like you, like you
And I can almost hear her laugh
Curving on her back for you, for you

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect

I can see her body rushing into you
Crashing on your skin
Burning within, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin next to me
She's crashing on your skin
Settling in, burning so deep, deep
On your skin, skin while you sleep, uh

I can taste her lipstick and see her laying across your chest
I can feel the distance every time you remember her fingertips
Maybe I should be more like her
Maybe I should be more like her
I can taste her lipstick, it's like I'm kissing her, too
And she's perfect---

I dive into the future
But I'm blinded by the sun
I'm reborn in every moment
So who knows what I'll become

I feel like I've awakened lately
The chains around me are finally breaking
I've been under self-restoration
I'm becoming my own salvation
Showing up, no more hiding, hiding
The light inside me is bursting, shining
It's my, my, my time to butterfly

What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival

I'll walk through the fire, I'll begin again
I'll burn through my skin
Cause I, cause I wanna feel it
Reaching for the truth, not afraid to lose
What shattered through me like a rifle (rifle) was a revival, revival, yeah
I admit, it's been painful, painful
But I'll be honest, I'm grateful, grateful
It's my, my, my time to realize

What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

You can stand beside the madness like a falling tear
You can hold onto the sadness like a souvenir
Or you can close your eyes and see your life
Like the air

You can tap into the strength you never knew you had
You can breathe into your faith no matter where you’re at
Just close your eyes and change your life
Like the air

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
You can rise
Like the air you can rise

The earth can pull you down with all its gravity
And the measure of your worth is sometimes hard to see
So just hold on, when the night is done
Like the sun

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
You can rise
Like the air you can
Rise

So even when your bones feel like weights
And it’s hard to lift the smile on your perfect face
You can still find a peaceful place
Close your eyes until you're floating up in outer space
It’ll be alright, they’re just jealous of your highs
So they can knock you down, but

Like the air you can
Rise from the rubble with your mind, you can hover
You can rise like the tide, like the heat in the summer
Yes, I know there are those who will wanna bring you down
But you can rise with your mind and make your higher power proud
You can rise
Like the air you can rise
Like the air you can rise---

Round & Round

You see me standing there 
And act like you don't know me 
But last night you were calling me 
Saying you want me 

Oh why you always make me feel 
Like I'm the one that's crazy 
You feel my heart racing 
My, my heart racing 

Boy, I need you here with me 
We can't go on this way 
I'm falling hard for you 
All I can say 
We're going round & round 
We're never gonna stop going round & round 
We'll never get where we're going 
Round & round 
Well you're gonna miss me 
Cause I'm getting dizzy going 
Round & round & round 

You come to pull me close 
And whisper in my ear 
You always told me lies 
I've cried out all my tears 
I push my feelings to the side 
But then you bring them back 
Bring them back 
Now you got me singing 

Love me or love me not 
I'm staring at the clock 
I pick them flower petals off 
And then I watch them drop [x2] 

We're never gonna stop going 
Round & round 
We'll never get where we're going 
Round & round 
Well you're gonna miss me 
Cause I'm getting dizzy going

Boy, I need you here with me
We can't go on this way

All I can say
We're going round & round
We're never gonna stop going round & round
We'll never get where we're going
Round & round
Well you're gonna miss me
Cause I'm getting dizzy going
Round & round & round

You come to pull me close
And whisper in my ear
You always told me lies
I've cried out all my tears
I brush my feelings to the side
But then you bring them back
Bring them back
Now you got me singing

Love me or love me not
I'm staring at the clock
I pick them flower petals off
And then I watch them drop [x2]

[Chorus]

We're never gonna stop going
Round & round
We'll never get where we're going
Round & round
Well you're gonna miss me
Cause I'm getting dizzy going
Round & round & round

Uoh uoh uoh
Uoh uoh uoh
Uoh uoh uoh---Lyrics submitted by ezza.

(Round & Round)
Round & Round
Round & Round
Round & Round

You see me standing there
And act like you don't know me
But last night you were calling me
Saying you want me

Oh why you always make me feel
Like I'm the one that's crazy
You feel my heart racing
My my heart racing

[Chorus:]
Boy, I need you here with me
We can't go on this way
I'm falling hard for you
All I can say
We're going round & round
We're never gonna stop going round & round
We'll never get where we're going
Round & round
Well you're gonna miss me
Cause I'm getting dizzy going
Round & round & round

You come to pull me close
And whisper in my ear
You always told me lies
I've cried out all my tears
I brush my feelings to the side
But then you bring them back
Bring them back
Now you got me singing

[Chorus]

Love me or love me not
I'm staring at the clock
I pick them flower petals off
And then I watch them drop [x2]

[Chorus]

We're never gonna stop going
Round & round
We'll never get where we're going
Round & round
Well you're gonna miss me
Cause I'm getting dizzy going
Round & round & round

Uoh uoh uoh
Uoh uoh uoh
Uoh uoh uoh---Lyrics submitted by ezza.

Take away all your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know

I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, 'ow

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh, (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh, (that same old love)

I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
Cause I won't be changing too, you know

You can't believe, still can't believe it
You left me in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, 'ow

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh, (that same old love)
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh, (that same old love)---

I am so sick, I'm hoping you notice, yeah baby
So sick of the same old love
Like a dose of the same old drug, yeah baby
Really starting to get under my skin
When you see signs, get with it, yeah baby
Tell me why, love's a lie

I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now, now

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)

Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)

Swear it drives me crazy
So sick of the same old love baby
And I don't mean to make you cry baby
I thought can be by your side baby
Thought you were my ride or die baby
So sick of the same old love baby
And I don't mean to make you cry baby
Thought you were my ride or die baby

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough

Kiss the moon goodbye
But don't close your eyes, your eyes
It's the end of the night
But the beginning of time, for you and I
I can't believe that my body is still moving
It makes me feel like we're doing something right.

Baby when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy you keep my heartbeat skipping
When you touch me even though
The time is ticking away
Just tell me it's not over
And we'll never reach the end
But when the night starts slipping away,
Save the day
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day
Save the day
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day
Save the day

Yeah we're still wide awake
Got me losing my mind, my mind
No, it's never too late,
Put your lips on mine
In the burning sunlight, I
I can't believe that my body is still moving
It makes me feel like we're doing something right.

Baby when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy you keep my heartbeat skipping
When you touch me even though
The time is ticking away
Just tell me it's not over
And we'll never reach the end
But when the night starts slipping away,
Save the day
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day
De de de de de de day

Kiss the moon goodbye
But don't close your eyes, eyes, eyes

Baby when the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping
When the night starts slipping away
Boy you keep my heartbeat skipping
When you touch me even though
The time is ticking away
Just tell me it's not over
And we'll never reach the end

Don’t like waiting (x2)
Lets go right now!
Gotta’ hit the ground
Dancing before the music
Slows down

What I’m sayin’ (x2)
If there’s something to fix
take it to another level,
This is the remix

Everybody, everybody
Get out on the floor
It can get a little crazy
When the kick hits the floor

Make a scene (x2)
Nobody can ignore
Don’t knock it, til you rock it
We can’t take it not more!

Bring the lights up!
Bust the doors down!
Dust yourself off,
Shake it up!
Shake it up!
DJ set it off!
Take it up a notch
All together now!
Shake it up!
Shake it up!

Shake it up!
Break it down (x2)
I’ve got something to say
When you’re dancin’ whit me,
It’s like we go MIA

Make a scene (x2)
Nobody can ignore
Don’t knock it, til you rock it
We can’t take it not more!

Bring the lights up!
Bust the doors down!
Dust yourself off,
Shake it up!
Shake it up!
DJ set it off!
Take it up a notch
All together now!
Shake it up!
Shake it up!

Sh-sh-sh-Shake it up,
You gotta change it up!
And if the days not right?
Just brush it off tonight!
Put on the attitude!
Your in my pocket mood
And when you’ve had enough,
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up!

Bring the lights up!
Bust the doors down!
Dust yourself off,
Shake it up!
Shake it up!
DJ set it off!
Take it up a notch
All together now!
Shake it up!
Shake it up!---Lyrics submitted by ashley.

You know fairytales don't come true
Not when it comes to you
Open up for the first time
And you can bet that it's the last time

And I'm cool with laying low
Saturday night, and I'm staying home
I'm feeling good for the first time
It's been a while since the last time

I'll wave goodbye when you say hello
Woah

I'm sick of the sleepless never ending nights
I just don't care who was wrong or right
I'm sick of the rumors and the alibis
You tear me up
I'll cut you down to size
So sick of you
So sick of you
Sick of all of your little lies
So sick of you
So sick of you
Sick of all the girls by your side
What you don't know 
Is how great it feels to let you go

I cracked your game, it's so see through
You know I'm way too good for you
Moving on to the next time
Drop the baggage and I'll be fine

When it's time to reminisce
You're gonna realize you miss this
You're on my mind for the last time
And at the most, you were a past time

I'll wave goodbye when you say hello
Woah

I'm sick of the sleepless never ending nights

I just don't care who was wrong or right
I'm sick of the rumors and the alibis
You tear me up
I'll cut you down to size
So sick of you
So sick of you
Sick of all of your little lies
So sick of you
So sick of you
Sick of feeling bad by your side
What you don't know 
Is how great it feels to let you go

I'm happier alone
Taking down your pictures
And I'll throw those memories out the door
I'm sick of you
So sick of you
Sick of all of your little lies

I'm sick of the sleepless never ending nights
I just don't care who was wrong or right
I'm sick of the rumors and the alibis
You tear me up
I'll cut you down to size
So sick of you
So sick of you
Sick of all of your little lies
So sick of you
So sick of you
So I'm getting on with my life

So sick of you
So sick of you
So sick of you
Oh woah
So sick of you
So sick of you
So sick of you

Now that I have captured your attention
I want to steal you for a rhythm intervention
Mr. TSA I'm ready for inspection
Show me how you make a first impression

Oh, oh
Can we take it nice and slow, slow
Break it down and drop it low, low
Cause I just wanna party all night in the neon lights 'til you can't let me go

I just wanna feel your body right next to mine
All night long
Baby, slow down the song
And when it's coming closer to the end hit rewind
All night long
Baby, slow down the song

If you want me I'm accepting applications
So long as we keep this record on rotation
You know I'm good with mouth to mouth recitation
Breathe me in, breathe me out

We fall for each other at the wrong time
Only for a moment, but I don't mind
Guess I don't know where to draw the line, the line, the line
And we'll play the same game every night

Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

Why is it so different when we wake up?
Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch
Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough
But I know what's next, and I want so much

Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
Yeah!

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

You've got a hold on me
You're like a wasted dream
I gave you everything
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober---

Wake up to your dreams
And watch them come true
I'll make you whisper my name, I'll never leave the room
Night and day, I'll be your muse
No other girl can make you feel the way I do

I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon, I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you

Don't be afraid, close your eyes
Let me take you to places you've never been tonight
I thought by know you'd realize I can do anything I put my mind to

I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon, I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you

Everything I touch turns to love
Everything I do will open up heaven
It's dead steady, there's falling and flying in love
Nothing's forever because we are just stars, dance

I can make the stars dance
Light up the moon, I can make the stars dance
If you want me to
The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you

I can make the stars dance
I can make the stars dance
I can make, I can make, I can make the stars dance

The sky is everywhere, so meet me under there
I can make the stars dance dance dance with you ---

Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild, wild, wild
Mmm

You built me from a broken heart
With bricks you made from broken parts
You've fixed the paint, so we could start
So now what's mine is ours
I still have proof in form of scars
The first time always falls so far
Those healing wounds heal twice as hard
But now what's mine is ours
But now what's mine is ours

We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild

My sweet devoted counterpart
We kept each other's shooting stars
However close, however far
Whatever's mine is ours
Whatever's mine is ours

We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors
We are survivors of the wild
We are survivors (we are survivors)
We are survivors of the wild

Woahoooo (we are, we are)
Woahoooo (we are, we are)
Woahoooo(we are, we are)
We are survivors of the wild
Woahoooo (we are, we are)
Woahoooo (we are, we are)

Everybody tells me that it's so hard to make it
It's so hard to break in, there's no way to fake it
Everybody tells me that it's wrong what I'm feeling
I shouldn't believe in the dreams that I'm dreaming

I hear it every day, I hear it all the time
I'm never gonna amount to much
But they're never gonna change my mind, oh!

Tell me, tell me something I don't know

Everybody tells me that it's one in a million
More like one in a billion or one in a zillion

I hear it every day, I hear it all the time
I'm never gonna amount to much
But they're never gonna change my mind, oh!

Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know

Something I don't know, something I don't know

How many inches in a mile, what it takes to make you smile
Teach ya not to treat me like a child, baby
Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know

Really ready for it?

It won't be easy!

Tell me, tell me, tell me something I don't know
Something I don't know, something I don't know

When, I, wanted you
You would not reciprocate
When, I, needed you
You would always show up late

But thing's have changed
And I've got the upper hand
You can run and I've got you eating
Out of my hand

That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it
Make my dinner, bring it to me
That's more like it X2

Yeah that's more like it X2
I see where and when it happens 
That's more like it X4

When, my, birthday came
You would not remember it
When, I, talked to you
You were never listening

But tables turn
And it's great to be on top
Got you great to appreciate
The good that you've got

That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it
Make my dinner, bring it to me
That's more like it X2

Yeah that's more like it X2
I see where and when it happens 
That's more like it X4

I like chocolate 
And I like daises
Maybe you better write this down

I love cashmere
And I want diamonds
I'm ready for my massage right now
Oh right now

That's more like it, yeah
That's more like it
Make my dinner, bring it to me
That's more like it X2

Yeah that's more like it X2

You got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing
I've ever known, I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Hell over trip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants---

You got me sippin' on something
I can't compare to nothing

You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Hell over trip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings
No wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might be right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants, baby
It wants what it wants
It wants what it wants---

Everything's cool, yeah
it's all gonna be okay, yeah
and I know
maybe i'll even laugh about someday
but not today, no
'cuz I don't feel so good
i'm tangled up inside
my heart is on my sleeve
tomorrow is a mystery to me

(chorus)
and it might be wonderful
it might be magical
it might be everything I've waited for
a miracle
oh, but even if I fall in love again 
with someone new
it could never be the way I loved you


lettin you go ,yeah
makin me feel so cold , yeah---

I look at you, and all I wanna do, it's just dissapear
I got a craving for you, baby, can we get out of here
You're a sexy machine, you're a hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Let's drop out of this crowd, somewhere no one's allowed
I want you

All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah,
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
Find me in the shadows,
And put the shades dow until tomorrow
And make sure that no-nobody follows
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

[Break:]
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark
And you can never get me like the math that you know by heart
You're a sexy machine, you're a hollywood dream
And you got me feeling like a homecoming queen
Let's drop out of this crowd, somewhere no one's allowed
I want you

All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah,
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover
Find me in the shadows,
And put the shades dow until tomorrow
And make sure that no-nobody follows
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

I wanna find a place where we can be alone in the dark
And you can never gave me like a math that you know my heart

All to myself, I want you all to myself
And nobody else, yeah,
You don't need no other lover,
You don't need no other lover
You don't need no other lover
We can keep it undercover

[Break:]
You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover

You don't need no other lover, we can keep it undercover---

Everything’s cool, yeah
It’s all gonna be okay, yeah
And I know,
Maybe I’ll leave and
laugh about it someday

But not today, no
Cause I don’t feel so good
I’m tangled up inside
My heart is on my sleeve
Tomorrow is a mystery to me

(Chorus)
And it might be wonderful
It might be magical
It might be everything I’ve waited for,
A miracle
Oh, but even if I fall in love again
with someone new
It could never be the way I loved you

Letting you go is
making me feel so cold, yeah
And I’ve been trying to make
believe it doesn’t hurt

But that makes it worse, yeah
See, I’m a wreck inside
My toung is tied and my
whole body feels so weak
The future may be all I really need

And it might be wonderful, yeah
It might be magical, uh oh
It might be everything I’ve waited for,
A miracle
Oh, but even if I fall in love again
with someone new
It could never be the way I loved you

Like a first love,
the one and only true love
wasn’t directly all over my taste, yeah
I loved you like you loved me (oh)
Like something pure and holy
Like something that can never be replaced

And it was be wonderful,
It was magical,
It was everything I’ve waited for,
A miracle
And if I should ever fall in love again
with someone new
Oh, It could never be the way
No, It will never be the way
I loved you---

Is it alright 
If I'm with you for the night?
Hope you don't mind, 
If you stay by my side 

We can drive in your car
Somewhere into the dark,
Pull over and watch the stars
We can dance, We can sing, 
Do whatever you think
As long as I'm with you

[Chores]
When we are together 
It's the time of our lives
We can do whatever,
Be whoever we like
Spend the weekend dancing,
'Cause we sleep when we die
Don't have to worry 'bout nothing
We own the night [x4]

Its all a blur
It's getting late
But I don't care (I don't care)

I don't know where
We'll end up and that's okay

We can drive in your car
Somewhere into the dark,
Pull over and watch the stars
We can dance, We can sing, 
Do whatever you think
As long as I'm with you

[Chores]

Nothing last forever,
Let's live it up,
When we're together. 
Nothing last forever,
Let's live it up
Just do whatever 

[Chores x2]---Lyrics submitted by venny.

Been a long day
Waiting for the night to come
I check my iPhone
Let me see what's going on, going on, going on
Help me DJ (DJ DJ)
Play my favorite song
Make the speakers shake, speakers shake
Now everybody want to sing along, sing along

When the night is here
The only thing on my mind
Is having a good time
When the moon appears
You can always hear us say

The party doesn't start till the sun goes down
That's when everything starts moving
Everybody out when the sun goes down, ah ah ah
The music isn't on till it's way too loud
That's when everyone starts dancing
Everybody shout when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down (x3)

Oh oh oh Yeah

Rushing my hands up
I'm feeling good now
On the dance floor
We can turn it inside out, inside out

When the night is here
The only thing on my mind
Is having a good time
With my friends 
That's real
You can always hear us say

The party doesn't start till the sun goes down
That's when everything starts moving
Everybody out whent the sun goes down, ah ah ah
The music isn't on till it's way too loud
That's when everyone starts dancing
Everybody shout when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down (x3)

Oh oh oh Yeah

Down down down
The sun is going
Down down down
When the moon appears
You can always hear us say

When the stars come out
You can always hear us say

Oh oh oh Yeah

The party doesn't start till the sun goes down
That's when everything starts moving
Everybody out whent the sun goes down, ah ah ah
The music isn't on till it's way too loud
That's when everyone starts dancing
Everybody shout when the sun goes down
When the sun goes down (x6)

Oh oh oh Yeah---Lyrics submitted by hannah.

Baby no lights, 
Hits the spotlight, 
I'm in my fly, 
To take you away.
I'm feelin so free, 
You're makin me crazy, 
That's what you do, 
That's what you do, 
Lets go now.

Lickety split, 
You fell in a bash, 
She falls in a pit saying "hello darling", 
Twisted insanity, 
Falling humanity, 
All that I want is some tranquility, 
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Well come on boy.

Chorus:
Come on and take me to the other side, 
I'm gonna wait, I wanna look into your eyes, 
I'm so in love, I think I'm gonna crash and get
Whiplash whiplash whiplash.
It's up to you and I don't wanna give you clues, 
I'm goin fast, I think we got enough to lose, 
Don't look back or else were gonna crash and get
Whiplash whiplash whiplash.

Like a first kiss, 
With the sweet list, 
Of some love song, 
Oh yeah.
With this melody, 
Fallin over me, 
It makes me weak, 
So damn weak, 
So lets go now.

Lickety split, 
You fell and a bash, 
She falls in a pit saying "hello darling", 
Twisted insanity, 
Fallen humanity, 
All I want is some tranquility, 
Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?
Well come on boy.

Chorus:
Come on and take me to the other side,

Don't look back or else were gonna crash and get
Whiplash whiplash whiplash.

I wouldn't wanna be anybody else. Hey.
You made me insecure
Told me I wasn’t good enough
But who are you to judge
When you’re a diamond in the rough
I’m sure you got some things
You’d like to change about yourself
But when it comes to me
I wouldn’t want to be anybody else

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na 

I’m no beauty queen
I’m just beautiful me

Na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na 

You’ve got every right
To a beautiful life
C'mon

[Chorus]
Who says
Who says you’re not perfect
Who says you’re not worth it
Who says you’re the only one that’s hurting
Trust me
That’s the price of beauty
Who says you’re not pretty
Who says you’re not beautiful
Who says

[Selena Gomez - Verse 2]
It’s such a funny thing
How nothing’s funny when it’s you
You tell ‘em what you mean
But they keep whiting out the truth
It’s like a work of art
That never gets to see the light
Keep you beneath the stars
Won’t let you touch the sky



Na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na 

I’m no beauty queen
I’m just beautiful me

Na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na 

You’ve got every right
To a beautiful life

Who says
Who says you’re not perfect
Who says you’re not worth it
Who says you’re the only one that’s hurting
Trust me
That’s the price of beauty
Who says you’re not pretty
Who says you’re not beautiful

[Bridge]
Who says
Who says you’re not star potential
Who says you’re not presidential
Who says you can’t be in movies
Listen to me, listen to me
Who says you don’t pass the test
Who says you can’t be the best
Who said, who said
Won’t you tell me who said that
Yeah, oh
Who says

[Chorus]
Who says
Who says you’re not perfect
Who says you’re not worth it
Who says you’re the only one that’s hurting
Trust me
That’s the price of beauty
Who says you’re not pretty
Who says you’re not beautiful

Take my arm, take my head
Make your mark like a man
Write your name, gonna write your name
Hurts so good, love and pain
When all fades, you remain
Write your name, gonna write your name

Write your name, across my heart
Write your name, over every part
And we could be, worlds apart
Write your name, across my heart

Write your name
Gonna write your name
Write your name
Gonna write your name

Permanent, leave your scar
When you're gone, you' re never far
Write your name, gonna write your name
Cover me, all you are, over me, your signature
Write your name, gonna write your name

Write your name, across my heart
Write your name, over every part
And we could be, worlds apart
Write your name, across my heart

It's your name across my heart
Written in gold, a permanent mark
Let em' graved, It's what we are,
More than words, this love is art
Poetry emotion, put it right there
Deeper than skin, crystal clear
Letters don't fade, titanium made
Forever here, forever saved
Write your name, across my heart

Write your name, across my heart
Write your name, over every part
And we could be, worlds apart
Write your name, across my heart
Write your name
Gonna write your name
Write your name
Gonna write your name ---

Can you feel me
When I think about you
With every breath I take
Every minute
No matter what I do
My world is an empty place

Like I've been wonderin the desert
For a thousand days (oooh)
Don't know if it's a mirage
But I always see your face, Baby

[Chorus:]
I'm missing you so much
Can't help that im in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I’ll survive
But a day without you is like a year without rain (oooh) whooo

The stars are burning
I hear your voice in my mind (voice in my mind)
Can't you hear me calling
My heart is yearning
Like the ocean is running dry
Catch me I'm falling

It's like the ground is crumbling underneath my feet
Won't you save me
There's gonna be a monsoon
when you get back to me (ooooh Baby)

[Chorus]
I'm missing you so much
Can't help that im in love
A day without you is like a year without rain
I need you by my side
Don't know how I’ll survive
a day without you is like a year without rain (oooh) whooo

So let this drought come to an end
And make this desert flower again
and i need you here, i cant explain
the day without you 
is like a year without rain (oooh)

[Chorus]
I'm missing you so much
Can't help that im in love
A day without you is like a year without rain

Don't know how I’ll survive
