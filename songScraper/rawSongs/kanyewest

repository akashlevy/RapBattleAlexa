Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa---

[Chorus - 4x]
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down

[Verse - Kanye West]
Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurrre
The concept of school seems so securrre
Sophmore three yearrrs aint picked a careerrr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus (a Lexus)
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well

[Chorus - repeat 2x (w/ Kanye ad-libs)]

[Verse - Kanye West]
Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe

[Chorus - repeat 2x (w/ Kanye ad-libs)]

[Verse - Kanye West]
I say fuck the police, thats how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shortys hollering "where the ballas' at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it

It's amazing
I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening

I'm exhausted
Barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in

No matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)

I'm a monster
I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong, yeah

I'm a problem
That'll never
Ever be solved

And no matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin' (Let's go)

I'm a monster
I'm a maven
I know this world is changin'

Never gave in
Never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of

No matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

It's amazin', so amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'.

So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'

(Young Jeezy)

I'm amazin'
Yeah I'm all that
If I ain't on my grind
Then what you call that?

Victorious
Yeah we warriors
We make history
Strive of Victory

Standing at my podium
I'm trying watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure
You even let the feds get cha!

I'm amazin'
Born on the full moon
I was bred to get in
No spoon

That's why I'm so goose
Summer time, no juice
Big family, small house no rooms

They like oh god!
Why you go so hard?
Look what he's been through
He deserves an applause

So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'
So amazin', so amazin', so amazin', it's amazin'

Didn't you know, I was waitin on you
Waitin' on a dream that'll never come true
Didn't you know, I was waitin' on you
My face turned to stone when I heard the news
When'd you decide to break the rules?
Cause I just heard some real bad news

People talk like it's old news
I played it off and act like I already knew
Let me ask you, how long have you known dude?
You played it off and act like he's brand new
When'd you decide to break the rules?
Cause I just heard some real bad news

Real bad news [x3]

Oh you just goin' keep another, no you wont
Oh you just goin' keep it like you never knew
Oh you just goin' keep another love for you
Oh you just goin' keep em like you never knew
While im waitin on a dream that'll never come true
Oh you just goin' keep em like you never knew

Its what you all been waiting for ain't it?
What people pay paper for damn it
They cant stand it, they want something new
So let's get re-acquainted
Became the hood favorite
I cant even explain it
I surprise myself too

Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit that fresh shit on, with something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, here's another hit, Barry Bonds

[Hook - Kanye West]
(yeah yeah yeah yeah)
We outta here baby!
We outta here baby!
We outta here baby!

[Kanye West]
Dude!
Fresh off the plane, konitchiwa bitches
Turn around another plane, my passport on pivot
As for what I did it, that asshole done did it
Talked it and he lived it, spitted then he shitted
I don't need to write hits, I might bounce ideas,
But only I could come up with some shit like this
I done played the underdog my whole career
Ive been a very good sport, haven't I, this year
They said he's going crazy and we seen this before
But I'm doing pretty good as far as geniuses go
And I'm doing pretty hood in my pink polo
Nigga please, how you gonna say I ain't no low-head
Cos my Dior got me more model head
I'm insulted
You should go head
And bow so hard till your knees hit your forehead
And the flow just hit code red
Top 5 MC's you ain't gotta remind me
Top 5 MC's you gotta rewind me
I'm high up on the line, you can get behind me
But my head's so big you can't sit behind me
Life of a Don, lights keep glowin'
Comin' in the club wit that fresh shit on, with something crazy on my arm
Ha Ha Hum, here's another hit, Barry Bonds

[Hook - Lil Wayne]
(Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah)
Yeah, Yeah, We outta here baby!
Wha, Wha, We outta here baby!
And Mr. West is so outta here baby
And me, I'm Mr. Weezy Baby

[Lil Wayne]
I'm so bright not shady
My teeth and my eyes so wight like Shady
Ice in my teeth so refrigerated
I’m so fucking good like I’m sleeping with Megan
I’m all about my franklins, Lincolns and Reagans
Whenever they make them, I shall hayve them
Oops I meant have them, I'm so crazy
But if you play crazy you be sleeping with daisies
Its such a hayvic, oops I meant havoc
And my drink's still pinker than the easter rabbit
And I'm still cold (cole) like Keisha's family
Stove on my waist turn beef to patties
And I ate it cos I'm so at it
I don't front and I don't go backwards
And I don't practice
and I don't lack shit
And you can get Barried
Suck my bat bitch

[Chorus - Kanye West]
We outta here baby
We outta here baby
We outta here baby

[Intro: Kanye West]
Stadium status...
Unh...
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Use to be Dame and Bigg's brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, now let the story begin
It's the Hard Knock Life Tour, sellout; picture
us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out "Jigga!"
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y, and 'Ye so shy
Now he won't even step to his idol to say hi
Standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
Back of my mind, "He could change yo' life
With all these beats I did, at least let him hear it
At least you can brag to ya friends back at the Chig'"
But he got me out me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib

[Chorus]
Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Use to be Dame and Bigg's brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, now let the story begin
Begin... let the story begin... story begin
If you feel the way I feel
Why don't you wave your hands, hands...

[Verse One]
Fresh off the plane, Im off to Baseline
Nothin' handed out, I'm 'bout to take mine
'Round the same time of that "Blueprint" one
And these beats in my pocket was that "Blueprint" forum
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'll bob his head and say "Damn! Oh, that's you?"
But by the "Black Album" I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like "Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Colleen told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum

[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Use to be Dame and Bigg's brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, now let the story begin
Begin... let the story begin, begin...
If you feel the way I feel
Why won't you wave your hands

[Verse Two]
Have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant?
Not only a client, the Presidito
Hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
I was always on the other side of the peephole
Then I dropped "Jesus Walks" now I'm on the steephole
And we know, "New Jack City" got to keep my brother
But to be number one I'ma beat my brother
On that "Diamonds" remix I swore I was fast
Then my big brother came thru and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammy's I said "I inspired me"
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it like pick-and-roll
Cuz even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
But my shit was more like a finger roll
But I had them singles though
And them hoes at the show gon' mingle, yo
Heh, y'all know
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like "Damn, no way"
Translate, espanol "No way, Jose"
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known THAT was gon' come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the city, Roc-A-Fella chain
Never be the same, never be another
Number one, Young Hov, also my big brother

[Chorus]
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Use to be Dame and Bigg's brother
Who was Hip Hop brother, who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends

Toomp killed this shit...---Lyrics submitted by Maliq.

[Verse 1]
For my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking
Fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting
Like them black kids
In Chiraq bitch

[Hook]
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Bridge]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

[Hook]
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Verse 2]
Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doing shit
Them niggas ain't doing shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathing you gasping
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action

[Hook]
Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right

I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless

To whom much is given much is tested
Get arrested guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly

Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My momma couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talkin' like it's just you and me

I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosby's, I ain't go to Hill, man
I guess the money should have changed him
I guess I should have forgot where I came from

La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?

Excuse me? Was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let up the suicide doors
This is my life homey, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell you who the side was

So I parallel double park that mother*** sideways
Old folks talking 'bout back in my day
But homey this is my day, class started two hours ago
Oh, am I late?

No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive

Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And then say something where you gonna end up apologin'
Let me know if it's a problem man
Aight man, holla then

La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?

Excuse me? Was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash
Let that man get passed
He don't even stop to get gas

If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of ***?

Must be the Pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a, uh, dependin' how you dress her

So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam, Eve wear Nada
I'm in between but way more fresher
With way less effort
'Cause when you try hard is when you die hard
Y'all homies lookin' like, why God?
When they reminisce over you, my God

La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?

Excuse me? Was you saying something?
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh uh, you can't tell me nothing

La la la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la

Chorus 
(Did you realize 
That you were a champion) 

(Kanye) 
Yes I did 
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib 
Just a lil somethin', show you how we live 
Everybody want it but it aint that serious 
Mhmmm thats that shit 
So if you gon do it, do it just like this 

Chorus 
(Did you realize 
That you were a champion) 

You dont see just how wild the crowd is 
You dont see just how fly my style is 
I dont see why I need a stylist 
When I shop so much I can speak italian 
I dont know I just want it better for my kids 
And I aint sayin we was from the projects 
But everytime I wanna layaway or deposit 
My dad'll say when you see clothes, close your eyelids 
We was sort of like Will Smith and his son 
In the movie I aint talkin' bout the rich ones 
Cuz every summer 
He'll get some brand new harebrain scheme to get rich from 
And I dont know what he did for dough 
But he'll send me back to school with a new wardrobe 
and ay, ay, ay ,ay 

Chorus 
(Did you realize 
That you were a champion) 

I think he did 
When he packed it up and brought it back to the crib 
Just a lil somethin', show you how we live 
Everything I wanted man it seemed so serious 
Mhmmm thats that shit 
So if you gon do it, do it just like this 

Chorus 
(Did you realize 
That you were a champion) 

When it feel like living's harder than dying 
For me giving up's way harder than trying 
Lauryn Hill said her heart was in Zion 
I wish her heart still was in rhyming 
Cuz who the kids gon' listen to 
Huh 
I guess me if it isnt you 
Last week I payed a visit to the Institute 
They got the Dropout keepin' kids in the school 
I guess i cleaned up my act like prison do 
If not for pledge at least for the principle 
They got the CD they got to see me 
Drop gems like i droped out of PE 
They used to feel invisible 
Now they now they invincible 

Chorus 
(Did you realize 
That you were a champion) 
This is the story of a champion 
runners on their mark and they pop their guns 
Stand up stand up here he comes 
Tell me what it takes to be number 1 
Tell me what it takes to be number 1 

This is the story of a champion 
runners on their mark and they pop their guns 
Stand up stand up here he comes 
Tell me what it takes to be number 1 
Tell me what it takes to be number 1 

(Did you realize 
That you were a champion) 
Yes I did 
So I packed it up and brought it back to the crib 
Just a lil somethin', show you how we live 
Everybody want it but it aint that serious 
Mhmmm thats that shit 
So if you gon do it, do it just like this

[Intro]
What of the dollar you murdered for
Is that the one fighting for your soul
Or your brother’s the one that you’re running from
But if you got money, fuck it, because I want some

[Hook: Big Sean]
Ain’t nobody fuckin’ with my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain’t nobody freshin’ than my muthafuckin’
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don’t do it like my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the
They want the, they want the

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say
My block behind me like I’m coming out the driveway
It’s grande, from Friday, to next Friday
I been up straight for nine days, I need a spa day
She tryna get me that poo tang
I might let my crew bang
My crew deeper than Wu Tang
I’m rolling with (Huh) fuck I’m saying?
Girl, you know my crew name
You know 2 Chainz? Scrrr!
I’m pullin’ up in that Bruce Wanye
But I’m the fuckin’ villian, man, they kneelin when I walkin in the building
Freaky women I be feelin’ from the bank accounts I’m fillin’
What a feeling, ah man, they gotta be
Young player from the D that’s killin’ everything that he see

[Hook]

[Jay-Z:]
Yeah am talking Ye’, yeah am talking Rih’, yeah I’m talking Bey, nigga I’m talking me
Yeah I’m talking bossy, I ain’t talking Kelis
You’re money too short, you can’t be talking to me
Yeah I’m talking LeBron, we balling our family tree
G.O.O.D Music drug dealing drug cousin, ain’t nothing fuckin’ with we
Turn that 62 to 125, 125, to a 250, 250 to a half a milli, ain’t nothin’ nobody can do with me
Now who with me? ¡Vámonos! Call me Hov or jefe
Translation, I’m the shit. Least that what my neck say, least that what my check say
Lost my homie for a decade, nigga down for like 12 years, ain’t hug his son since the second grade
He never told, who we gonna tell, we top of the totem pole
It’s the dream team meets the supreme team, and all our eyes green and only means one thing
You ain’t fuckin’ with my clique

[Kanye West:]
Break records of Louie
Ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival the unamerican idols
When niggas did in Paris got em hanging off the Eiffel
Yeah I’m talking business
We talking CIA
I’m talking George Tenet
I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach
Think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know white people get money don’t spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ig’nant
I know Spike Lee gon kill me but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we living no limits
Them gold master p ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I’m looking at a crib right next to where TC lives
That’s Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn’t really drunk he just had a few brews
Pass the refreshment a cool cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew present
Steve-O swerve homie, watch out for the waves
I’m way too black to burn from sunrays
So I just meditated the home in Pompay
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time I’m in Vegas they screaming like he’s Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real got me feelin’ Isrealian
Like Bar Refaeli Gisele, no thats Brazilian
Went through deep depression when my momma passed
Suicide what kind of talk is that
But I’ve been talking to God for so long
That I have you look in my life I guess he talking back
Fuckin’ with my clique ---

On lonely nights I start to fade(x2)

Her loves a thousand miles away(x2)

Memories made in the coldest winter, goodbye my friend, will I eva love again

Memories made in the coldest winter....

It's 4 am and I can't sleep(x2)

Her love is all that I can see(x2)

Memories made in the coldest winter, goodbye my friend , will I eva love again

Memories made in the coldest winter....

Winter(x2)

Goodbye my friend, will I eva love again(x3)

It's rain can't take the snow away(x2)

It melt away all our mistakes(x2)

Memories made in the coldest winter, goodbye my friend, I won't eva love again

Neva again....---Lyrics submitted by Tricey.

[Mos Def]
Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Lupe Fiasco]
Head to the sky, wings raised in
Shes about to fly and take her place in
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground
She’ll see a broken heart, if she turns around
But aint no going back, this is how it must be
He told her, she’ll be burned alive
She just told him trust me
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Knowing she told her you’ll leave me if you loved me
And he knows that, because he knows her
Hard to hide his feeling’s as it engulfs her
Now she’s a bright blaze, light rays
A shooting out Phoenix on fire buring up the night scape
So lets hear it for our heroine, applaud as our spirits fly into the never end
One closed chapter, it opens up another part
So this is more like, the end, question mark (question mark, question mark)

[Mos Def]
Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Kanye West]
Don’t let me hold you back
I only hold you back
We on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac
So fly baby, my baby, so high, sometimes its so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to ballet
We pulled up to the valet, we’ll teach our daughter ballet
We’ll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she’ll be a Halle
You woulda been the best mom
I would have been the best ‘Ye
You see it all in my veins, like varicose
I know thats very gross but we getting very close
To our end, though I killed most with a pen
Soon as this flow end, I’ma let Mos begin

[Mos Def]
Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you doDon’t look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don’t look down, its an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

How could you do it
How could you do it

[Big Sean]
Okay now baby here we go, we go
No baby, me go
You got my heart
Baby this what it be for
I give it all as far as my feet go
What do you mean, me go
Why can’t it be, we go
What happens when people turn to tears
Dreams turn to memories
And weeks turn to years
Huh? standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back, wish it came with a couple reciepts
Man, our vacation was coming next week
Girl I swear you was a trip, lets make it a couples retreat (do it)
How cud my girl do this to me
Woke up sayin no, the World did this to me
Now I’m testing one two
Reportin live from the rubble
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
One, two, three, four, five models on the double
Give me head all at once look like they line in a huddle
But its not even half the feeling as hearing you shine
She know I love ya, shedding tears everyday
And I’m tired of lying in these puddles
I ask “Y” sometimes like a f-cking vowel
But hitting tree’s everyday like a f-cking owl
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds
Caught the Phoenix Sun to Nash it out, I mean ash it out.
So I could see you smile
I-I know you can see me now

[Mos Def]

Oh oh oho.
damn, here we go again.
Oh oh oho.
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam,

now everything I'm not, made me everything I am.
damn, here we go again.
people talking shit, but when the shit hit the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am.

I never be picture-perfect-Beyonce
Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet
He was as black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as his beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake-ass facade they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played a big role in Chicago like Queen Latifah?
I never rock a mink coat in the winter time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots in the summertime like Will.I.am
Let me know if you feel it man
'cause everything I'm not, made me everything I am

Damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

and I'm back to tear it up
haters, start your engines
I hear 'em gearin' up
people talk so much shit about me at barbershops
they forget to get their haircut
OK fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
'cause they want gun-talk, or I don't wear enough
baggy clothes, Reebok's, or Adidas
can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
so say goodbye to the NAACP award
goodbye to the India.Arie award
they'd rather give me the nigga-please award
but I'll just take the I-got-a-lot-of-cheese award

damn, here we go again.
everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.
people talk shit, but when shit hits the fan
everything I'm not, made me everything I am

I know that people wouldn't usually rap this
but I got the facts to back this
just last year, Chicago had over 600 caskets
man, killing's some wack shit
oh, I forgot, 'cept for when niggas is rappin'
do you know what it feel like when people is passin'?
he got changed over his chains, a block off Ashland
I need to talk to somebody, pastor
the church want tithe, so I can't afford to pay
the slip on the door, cause I can't afford to stay
my 15 seconds up, but I got more to say
That's enough Mr. West, please no more today

damn, here we go again.
everybody sayin' what's not for him
everything I'm not, made me everything I am
damn, here we go again.

She don't believe in shootin' stars, 
But she believe in shoes & cars
Wood floors in the new apartment, 
Couture from the store's department
You more like L'eau de Stardee shit, 
I'm more of the, trips to Florida
Order the hors devors, views of the Water
Straight from the page of your favorite author
And the weather so breezy, 
Man why can't life always be this easy
She in the mirror dancing so sleazy, 
I get a call like where are you Yeezy
Try to hit you with a 'Oeur de Whopee'
Till I get flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these nigga's got me, 
I hate these nigga's more than the Nazis

As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

I know it's been a while, 
Sweetheart, we hard-ly talk, I was doing my thing
I know I was foul bay-bay, 
A-bay late-ly you been all on my brain, 
And if somebody would've told me a month ago
Fronting though, yo I wouldn't wanna know
If somebody would've told me a year ago
It'd go, get this difficult
Feeling like Katrina with no fema
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back I still see ya
In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum, 
I'm just saying, Hey Mona Lisa, 
Come home you know you can't Rome without Caesar

[Dwele]
As I recall, I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
What do I know? Flashing lights, lights

But you never thought that I would take it this far

CHORUS
I don't wanna say goodbye to you so I'll just say goodnight to you
My people wonder why to you I'm just gonna say goodnight

VERSE 1
Right now I can see it so vivid
Like it was just yesterday like I could re-live it
Me and my grand parents on a field trip
and I'm a little kid trying to test the exhibits but 
In a faithful I get to get a hold of that
Men I wish I could stop time like a photograph
Every joke that they told I would know the laugh
Men, I wouldn't let a moment pass
What would it mean when you dream that you're falling
What would it mean when you dream that you're balling
What would it mean when you never dream at all and u don't really know
but you can't recall them
It's all a fight to get a chance to say hi to 
people you never got the chance to say hi to
Maybe you could put them up out of your dream into real life if you try to
So close (so close) So far (so far) so far (so far) no cigar (no cigar)
you can't dwell on the past all we got is today so Ima live like there is no tomorrow

And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way,
So this is in the name of love, like Robert says
Before you ask me to get a job today, can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage?
And I know the government administered AIDS,
So I guess we just pray like the minister say,
Allah o Akbar and throw em some hot cars,
Things we see on the screen are not ours,
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far,
Where im from, the dope boys is the rock stars,
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars,
I guess they want us all behind bars.
I know it.

[Chorus (Adam Levine)]
Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(ooooooooo)
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)
But we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

[Kanye]
They say people in your life are seasons,
And anything that happen is for a reason,
And niggas guns a clappin and keep to squeezin',
And Gran (Grandma) keep prayin' and keep believin',
And Jesus and one day that ya see him,
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him,
The devil is alive I feel him breathin',
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin',
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us,
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down,
Now my lil cousin smokin those cigarettes now,
His job trying to claim that he too niggerish now,
Is it cuz his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out...
Im Stickin around....

[Chorus (Adam Levine)]
Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(ooooooooo)
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)
But we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

(Cuz every worthless word we get more far away, and nothing's ever promised tomorrow today,
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

Now my lil cousin smokin those cigarettes now,
His job trying to claim that he too niggerish now,
Is it cuz his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out...
Im Stickin around....

[Chorus (Adam Levine)]
Uh, And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(ooooooooo)
And I heard 'em say, nothin ever promised tomorrow today.
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today.)
But we'll find a way
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

(Cuz every worthless word we get more far away, and nothing's ever promised tomorrow today,
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way)

In the night I hear `em talk
the Coldest story  ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless (ya-a-a)
How could you be so heartless?(y-a-a)Oh
How could you be so heartless?

How could you be so
Cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me yo
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Hey yo I know some things that you ain't told me
Hey yo I did some things but that's the old me
and now you wanna get me back 
and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend,
Well I got homies
but in the end it`s still so lonely

In the night I hear `em talk
the coldest story  ever told 
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless(ya-a-a)
How could you be so heartless?(ya-a-a)Oh
How could you be so heartless

How could you be so Dr.Evil 
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
I decided we were'nt gon' speak so
Why we up 3 AM on the phone
Why does she be so mad at me fo`
Homie I don't know 
She's hot and cold
I won't stop i won`t mess my groove up 
'Cause I already know how this thing goes
You run and tell your friends that your leavin' me 
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see  
 you'll never find nobody better than me

In the night I hear `em talk
The coldest story ever told 
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless(ya-a-a)
How could you be so heart less?(ya-a-a)Oh
How could you be so heartless?

Talkin', talkin', talkin' talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we've been through 
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I've got something new to see
And you just keep on hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
 I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong?
And you can`t make it right 
I'm gon' take off tonight 
Into the night

I hear `em talk
The coldest story  ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless(ya-a-a)
How could you be so heartless?Oh
How could you be so heartless?---Lyrics submitted by sherri.

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Fraud niggas, y'all niggas, that's that shit I don't like
Your shit make believe, rapping 'bout my own life
Real names kill things, that's that shit I won't write
Cause my niggas still selling dope like they ain't on their third strikes
Camping out in that corridor, fuck you waiting on Jordans for?
I middle-man it for 23, just meet me somewhere around Baltimore
(Woo!) That's rare nigga, (Woo!) Ric Flair nigga
(Woo!) The power's in my hair nigga, (Woo!) I give this beat the chair nigga
SoHo or Tribeca, three hoes: trifecta
Dope money, hope money, Hublot, my watch better
My pen's better, you don't write, trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or K's vomit – ungrateful niggas, I don't like

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
(This Chicago, nigga!)
They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound, that's a soundbite
The media crucify me like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathing like they found Mike
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
But I never hit a woman never in my life
I was in too deep like Mekhi Phife
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eating good, vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissing girls, cause it's hot, right?
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
We hanging out that window it's about to be a Suge night
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man that nigga nice
Shout out to L-E-P, Jay Boogie right?
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? right?!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
(Young Chop on the beat)
Fake Gucci, that's that shit I don't like
Smoking on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe
Screaming Sosa, that's that nigga that I like
I don't want relations, I just want one night
Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like
I got tats up on my arm, cause this shit is life
And I stunt so much in clothes, cause I'm living life
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealing light
Bitch I'm high off life, got me feeling right
Bitch I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like
And bitch we GBE, we just go on sight

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
We are not one and the same, nigga I'm fucking insane, fuck is you saying?
Yo ass been doing the same, shit, not doing what you saying
Dang, I told yo old bitch she was fucking a lame, turn one ho to a train
Blaow, blang, my niggas holding that pain, I just hope you been praying
Bang bang, riding for my niggas and that's for life
High class, I'm just surrounded by these lowlifes
And I run this bitch like it's no lights, going hard the whole night
Cause I ain't going back to my old life, I promise

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Jadakiss]
I done sold purple, I done sold white
Running outta work, that's that shit I don't like
She never let me hit it, she gave me dome twice
She blowing up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, 'nother 30 for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas---Lyrics submitted by camille.

Im not lovin you, the way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
Im in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So ya never know, never never know
Never know enough, til its over love
Til we lose control, system overload
Screamin no no no, no no
I aint lovin you, the way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but cant escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else dont have to know


So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
You keep ya love locked down, you lose


Im not lovin you, the way I wanted to
I cant keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got somethin to lose, so I gotta move
I cant keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when Im on my own
Somewhere far from home, In the danger zone
How many times did it take til I finally got through
you lose, you lose
I aint lovin you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to go
No more wastein time, we cant wait for life
which is wastin time, wheres the finish line


So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
You keep ya love locked down, you lose


Im not lovin you, the way i wanted to
I met no one new, I got no one new
No I said im through, but got love for you
But im not lovin you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it goin, keep the lovin goin
Keep it on a roll, only god knows
Am I into you, baby im confused
You choose, you choose
I aint lovin you, the way I wanted to
Way I got to go, I dont need you
I been on this road, too many times before
I aint lovin you, the way I wanted to


So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keepin ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keepin ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keepin ya love locked down, you lose
So keep ya love locked down, ya love locked down
Keepin ya love locked down, ya love locked down

OK, drop it to the floor

Woah make the ground move, that's an ass quake
Built a house up on that ass, that's an ass state
Roll my weed on it, that's an ass tray
Say Ye, say Ye, don't we do this err' day-day?
I work them long nights, long nights to get a pay day
Finally got paid, now I need shade and a vacay
And niggas still hatin', so much hate I need an AK
Now we out in Paris, yeah I'm Perrierin'
White girls politicin' that's that Sarah Palin
Gettin' high, Californicatin'

I'm poppin' too, these blue dolphins need two coffins
All she want is some heel money
All she need is some bill money
He take his time, he counts it out
I weighs it up, that's real money
Check the neck, check the wrist
Them heads turnin', that's exorcist
My Audemar like Mardi Gras
That's Swiss time and that's excellence

Let the suicide doors up
I do suicides on the tour bus
I do suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam building like I'm the shit
Tell 'em "Give me fifty million or I'm a quit"
Most rappers taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up in your face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press, kid
Plus your my bitch, make your bitch look like Precious
Something' 'bout Mary she gone off that Molly
Now the whole party is melted like Dalí
Now everybody is movin' they body
Don't sell me apartment, I move in the lobby
Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon see lawyers and niggas in Jordans

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
Now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane
Spit rounds like the gun range
Beat it up like Rampage
100 bands, cut your girl, now your girl need a band aid
Grade A, A1,
Chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds backpack around me
Cosigned by Louis Vuitton
Horse power, horse power
All this Polo on I got horse power
Pound of this cost 4 thousand

Rain pourin',

[Chorus]
Gossip gossip

The best living or dead hands down huh?
Less talk more head right now huh?
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I’m bout to take it to another level bitch
There you go again, aint nobody as cold as this
Through the rap and the track tripled up and no assist
But my only focus is staying on some bogus sh-t
Argue with my older bitch acting like I owe her sh-t
I heard the people sayin raps are gettin trap mayne
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
F-ckin up my money so yeh I had to act sane
Chi n-gga but he’s hold of his accent
She came up to me and said this the number 2 gal
If you wanna make it number one your number 2 now
This that goose an’ malibu I call it Malibooya
God damn Yeezy How I hit em with the new style
Know that muthaf-cker well, what you gon' do now
Whatever ever I wanna do, gosh its cool now
Nah gonna do, uhh its a new now
Think yo muthaf-cker really really need to cool down
Cause you ain't never get on top off this
So mommy's best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharoah
I put the p-ssy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just want a swallow ship
I’m living in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present kiss my ass

Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
None of you n-ggas know where the swamp is
None of you n-ggas have seen the carnage that I’ve seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder murder in black convertibles uh
I kill a block I murder the avenues uh
Rape and pillage a village, women and children
Everybody wanna know what my Achilles Heel is
LOVE I dont get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and blood suckers
All I see is these n-ggas I’ve made millionnaires
Milling about, spilling there feelings in the air
All I see is these fake f-cks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice cold veins

You can be the King but watch the Queen conquer
Ok first things first I’ll eat your brains
Then I’ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
Cause that’s what a muthaf-cking monster do
Hairdresser from milan, thats the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel that’s the monster shoe
Young money is the roster and a monster crew
And I’m all up all up all up in the bank with a funny face
And if I’m fake I don't know this cause my money aint
Now let me get this straight wait I’m the rookie
But my features and my shows ten times your pay
50k for a verse no album out
Yet my money’s so tall that my barbie’s gotta climb it 
Hotter than a middle eastern climate climate
Find it 20 mataran dutty whine it whine it
Nicki on a pit while I sign it
How these n-ggas so one-track minded
But really really I don’t give a F-U-C-K
Forget barbie f-ck Nicki cause she’s fake
She’s on a diet but her pockets eating cheese cake
And I’ll say Bride of Chucky is Child’s play
Just killed another career it’s a mild day
Besides ‘Yay they can’t stand besides me
I think me, you and him should minaj friday
Pa-pa-pa-pink wig thick ass give em whip lash
I thi-thi-thi-think big get cash make em blink fast
Now-now-now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Aaahhhh, I’m a muthaf-cking monster!

Told you I won't let this rap game change me, right?

When it comes to being true, at least true to me

Oh no you'll neva let me down,
Get up I get(down)

Get up I get(down)
Get up I get(down)

[Jay-Z:]
Yo, yo first I snatched the street then I snatched the charts,
First had they ear now I hav they're heart,
Rappers came and went,
I've been hear from the start,
Seen them put it together
Watch them take it apart,
See the Rovers roll up wit ribbons
I've seen them re-poed, re-sold and re-driven
So when I reload, he holds #1 position
When u hot I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzelin
It's plain to see
Nigga's can't f*** wit me
Cuz ima be that nigga fo life
This is not an image
This is God given
This is hard liven
Mixed wit crystal sipping
It's the most consistent
Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggaz visitin
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordan of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

[Chorus]

[Kanye West:]
I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit that seat where white folks ain't wanna us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
With that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob and to the dealership
That's why I hear new music
And I just don't be feeling it
Racism still alive they just be concealing it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show I.D to get inside of Sam's club
I did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptised at least 3 or 4 times
But in the land where nigga's praise
Yukons and getting paid
It gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than do-rags to get your waves
Noting sadder than that day my girl father past away
So I promised to Mr Rany I'm gonna marry your daughter
And u know I gotta thank u for they way that she was brought up
And I know that u were smiling when u see that car I bought her
And u sent tears from heaven when u seen my car get balled up
But I can't complaint what the accident did to my Left Eye
Cuz look what a accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah and now romeo must die
I know a got angels watching me from the other side

[Chorus x2]

[J.Ivy:]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious, but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual, my spirit is a part of this
That's why I get spiritual, but I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regimen navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental
Vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah, I need my loot by rent day
But that is not what gives me the heart of Kunte Kinte
I'm tryina give us "us free" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you, my many inspirations
When I say I can't, let you or self down
If I were of the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life in my grip
I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it been known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul, or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z (Kanye West)]
Who else you know been hot this long,
(Oh Ya, you know we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong,
(The ROC is in the building)
Built the ROC from a pebble, pedalled rock before I met you,
Pedalled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special,
Let you tell that man I'm falling,
Well somebody must've caught him,
Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em,
Number one albums, what I got like four of dem,
More of dem on the way,
The Eight Wonder on the way,
Clear the way, I'm here to stay,
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that, this and Jay,
Dissin' Jay 'ill get you mased,
When I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious,
Six Hail Maries, please Father forgive us,
Young, the Archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas,
The way y'all all follow Jigga,
Hov's a living legend and I tell you why,
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov still alive.

I'm talking to you, my many inspirations
When I say I can't, let you or self down
If I were of the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life in my grip
I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it been known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul, or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z (Kanye West)]
Who else you know been hot this long,
(Oh Ya, you know we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong,
(The ROC is in the building)
Built the ROC from a pebble, pedalled rock before I met you,
Pedalled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special,
Let you tell that man I'm falling,
Well somebody must've caught him,
Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em,
Number one albums, what I got like four of dem,
More of dem on the way,
The Eight Wonder on the way,
Clear the way, I'm here to stay,
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that, this and Jay,
Dissin' Jay 'ill get you mased,
When I start spitting them lyrics, niggas get very religious,
Six Hail Maries, please Father forgive us,
Young, the Archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas,
The way y'all all follow Jigga,
Hov's a living legend and I tell you why,
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov still alive.

So I ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me
first niggas gotta find me
What’s 50 grand to a muhfucka like me
Can you please remind me?
Ball so hard, this shit crazy
Y’all don’t know that don’t shit phase me
The Nets could go 0-82 and I look at you like this shit gravy
Ball so hard, this shit weird
We ain’t even s’pose to be here,
Ball so hard, since we here
It’s only right that we be fair
Psycho, I’m liable to go Michael
Take your pick, Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
Ball so hard, got a broke clock, Rolleys that don’t tick tock
Audemars that’s losing time, hidden behind all these big rocks
Ball so hard, I’m shocked too, I’m supposed to be locked up too
you escaped what I’ve escaped
You’d be in Paris getting fucked up too
Ball so hard, let’s get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days
Gold bottles, scold models, spillin’ Ace on my sick J’s
So ball so hard, bitch behave, just might let you meet Ye,
Chi towns D. Rose, I’m movin’ the Nets to BK

[Hook]
[x2]
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me
That shit cray [x3]

[Kanye West]
She said Ye can we get married at the mall?
I said look you need to crawl ‘fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
Ball so hard
That shit cray (that shit cray), ain’t it Jay?
Ball so hard
What she order (what she order), fish filet
Ball so hard
Your whip so cold, this old thing
Ball so hard
Act like you’ll never be around muhfuckas like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch she don’t wanna dance
Excuse my French but I’m in France (I’m just sayin’)
Prince William’s ain’t do it right if you ask me
Cause I was him I would have married Kate & Ashley
What's Gucci my nigga?
What's Louie my killa?
What's drugs my deala?
What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I’m the illest
Cause I’m suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris
And they going gorillas, huh!

[(Chazz) & Jimmy]
I don't even know what that means.
(No one knows what it means, but it's provocative)
No, it's not
(It gets the people going!)

[Jay-Z]
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me

[Kanye West]
You are now watching the throne
Don’t let me get in my zone [x3]
These other niggas is lyin’
Actin’ like the summer ain’t mine

[Jay-Z]
I got that hot bitch in my home

[Kanye West]
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don’t let me get in my zone [x4]
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I’m bout to kill it
How you know, I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don’t let me into my zone [x2]

[Jay-Z & Kanye West]
I’m definitely in my zone---Lyrics submitted by Binish.

As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me

Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say

Hello my only one, just like the morning sun
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

Hello my only one, just like the morning sun
You'll keep on rising till the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

Hey, hey, hey, hey

I’m livin’ in the 21st century
Doin’ something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the ’80s, got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his own theme music

No one man should have all that power
The clock’s tickin’, I just count the hours
Stop trippin’, I’m trippin’ off the power
(21st century schizoid man)

The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
We ain’t got nothin’ to lose, ma’fucka, we rollin’
Huh? Ma’fucka, we rollin’
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin’
Huh? I see you in the mornin’
This is way too much, I need a moment

No one man should have all that power
The clock’s tickin’, I just count the hours
Stop trippin’, I’m trippin’ off the power
‘Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours

And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they (21st century schizoid man)

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell ‘em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I’m an asshole? You niggas got jugs
You short-minded niggas’ thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice, brought the Dodies in
Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He know, he so, fuckin’ gifted
I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn’t open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
Is honestly being prodded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catchin’ up with me
Takin’ my inner child, I’m fighting for it, custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece

Nigga, no one man should have all that power
The clock’s tickin’, I just count the hours
Stop trippin’, I’m trippin’ off the power
‘Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours

And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they
And then they (Go)
And then they (21st century schizoid man)

Holy, powers, Austin, Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin’ nation
They say I was the obamanation of Obama’s nation
Well, that’s a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of day, goddammit, I’m killin’ this shit
I know damn well y’all feelin’ this shit
I don’t need yo’ pussy, bitch, I’m on my own dick
I ain’t gotta power trip, who you goin’ home with?
How ‘Ye doin’? I’m survivin’
I was drinkin’ earlier, now I’m drivin’
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin’?
I got the power, make yo’ life so excitin’ (So excitin’)

Now this’ll be a beautiful death
Jumpin’ out the window
Lettin’ everything go
Lettin’ everything go

Now this’ll be a beautiful death
Jumpin’ out the window
Lettin’ everything go
Lettin’ everything go

Now this’ll be a beautiful death
Jumpin’ out the window
Lettin’ everything go
Lettin’ everything go

Now this’ll be a beautiful death
Jumpin’ out the window
Lettin’ everything go
Lettin’ everything go

You got the power to let power come---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.

'Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up outta movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That'll turn my life to steven king

Up late night like she on patrol
Checking everything like I'm on parole
I told her it's something she don't need to know
She never let it go (ooo ohh)

OK ok, ok ok, you will never stop it now
You'll never stop it now

You like the girl from misery

She never let it go (oo ohh)

Run away fast as you can

I sent this girl a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

24/7, 365, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, all right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha?
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, they wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes wit' a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless

Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
Saw him on break next to the 'No Smoking' sign with a blunt and a Marl'
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers
That's a different world like three summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Mayback
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow

[Hook]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky

[Verse 2]
Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky
Let's go, yeah
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob
At the same time thirsty on the grind
Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
+My life, my love+ that's not mine
Why you ain't signed?
Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball
Never one to fall
Gotta get mine
Gotta take mine
Got a tech nine
Reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule wore headset nine
Puttin' known ass on shelves
Waitin' paitently I ask myself
Qhere I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets
Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet
Sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee
Stayin' low key, nope
Holler at God "Man why'd you had to take my folks?"
Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G
Love my G, Rolly G
Police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's
Got a lot of people countin' on me
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace
Should of finished school like my niece
Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow
Aw man, all this pressure

[Hook]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky

[Verse 3]
I remember havin' to take the dollar cab
Comin' home real late at night
Standin' on my feet all damn day
Tryin' to make this thing right
And havin' one of my co-workers say "Yo you look just like
This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night"
Well easy come, easy go
How that sayin' goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I all had that snatched from me
And all the faculties all turn their back on me
And didn't wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me
Cuz nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't wanna ever go back there
So I won't bee a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off

[Hook]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly...past the sky

[Outro]
I wanna fly, I wanna fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take me brother for a ride---Lyrics submitted by Natalie.

Let me know
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That being known let me know
Let me

Seems like street lights glowing
Happen to be just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fares
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

All the streetlights glowing
Happen to be
Just like moments passing
In front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fare
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

In the streets... In the streets
I'm just not there
In the streets
I'm just not there
Life's just not fair

Seems like street lights glowing
Happen to be just like moments passing in front of me
So I hopped in the cab and
I paid my fares
See I know my destination
But I'm just not there

In front of me

(feat. Lupe Fiasco)

[Chorus 1]
I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
For the day I die, I'mma touch the sky
Gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
For the day I die, I'mma touch the sky

Back when they thought pink polo's would hurt the Roc,
Before Cam got the shit to pop, the doors was closed.
I felt like Bad Boy's street team, I couldn't work the Lox (locks).
Now let's go.
Take 'em back to the plan...
Me and my momma hopped in the U-Haul van.
Any pessimists I ain't talked to them,
Plus, I ain't have no phone in my apartment.
Let's take 'em back to the club.
Least about an hour I would stand on line,
I just wanted to dance.
I went to Jacob an hour after I got my advance.
I just wanted to shine.
Jay's favorite line: "Dog, in due time"
Now he look at me, like "Damn, dog, you where I am"
A hip hop legend.
I think I died in an accident, cause this must be heaven.

[Chorus]

[Hook 1 (P. Diddy)]
Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
(Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world)
Now let's take 'em high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh la la la la la la la
(Top of the world, baby. T-Top of the world)

Back when Gucci was the shit to rock,
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop,
I'd do anything to say "I got it".
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket.
Before anybody wanted K-West beats,
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC.
Dog, I was having nervous breakdowns,
Like "Damn, these niggas that much better than me?"
Baby, I'm going on an airplane,
And I don't know if I'll be back again.
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets,
But when she came to kick it, things became different.
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on.
I couldn't keep it home, I thought I needed a Nia Long.
I'm trying to write my wrongs,
But it's funny these same wrongs helped me write this song.
Now,

[Chorus 2]
I gotta testify, come up in the spot looking extra fly
For the day you die, You gonna touch the sky
(You gonna touch the sky babygirl!) Testify, come up in the spot
Looking extra fly
For the day you die, You gonna touch the sky

Yes, yes, yes guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the Third.
Hear like ear till I'm beer on the curb
Peach fuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth's.
But, before you say another word,
I'm back on the block like I'm laying on the street.
I'm trying to stop lion like a Mum-Ra,
But I'm not lying when I'm laying on the beat.
Engarge, touché Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel as possessed as a gun charge.
I come as correct as a porn star,
In a fresh pair of steps and my best foreign car.
So, I represent the first.
Now, let me end my verse right where the horns are like

[Chorus 2]

[Hook 2 (P. Diddy)]
(We back at home, baby)
Sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
Sky, Sky high
I'm, I'm sky high
Yeah! (Keep it rolling)

Can’t a young nigga get money anymore?
Tell PETA my mink is draggin’ on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch wit’out no flaws
Come to meet me wit’out no drawers?
Dinner with Anna Wintour, racin’ wit’ Anja Rubik
I told you ma’fuckers it was more than the music
In the projects one day to Project Runway
We done heard all that loud-ass talkin’, we used to it
I’m from where shorties fucked up, double-cupped up
Might even kill somebody and YouTube it
So whoever think they words affect me is too stupid
And if you could do it better than me, then you do it
We flyer than the parakeet, floatin’ wit’ no parachute
Six thousand-dollar pair of shoes, we made it to the Paris news!
Don’t talk about style, ‘cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me ‘fore I embarrass you

Can’t a young nigga get money anymore?
Tell PETA my mink is draggin’ on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch wit’out no flaws
Come to meet me wit’out no drawers?

And the whole industry wanna fuck yo’ old chick
Only nigga I got respect for is Wiz
And I’ll admit, I fell in love with Kim
‘Round the same time she had fell in love wit’ him
Well, that’s cool, baby girl, do ya thing
Lucky I ain’t have Jay drop ‘im from the team
La familia, Roc Nation
We in the buildin’, but still keep it basement
Flyer than the parakeet, floatin’ wit’ no parachute
Six thousand-dollar pair of shoes, I made it to the Paris news
Don’t talk about style, ‘cause I embarrass you
Shut the fuck up when you talk to me ‘fore I embarrassed you
G.O.O.D. Music, we fresh, we fresh
Anything else, we detest, detest
Bitch-ass niggas got ass and breasts
All that said, lemme ask this quest’

Can’t a young nigga get money anymore?
Tell PETA my mink is draggin’ on the floor
Can I have a bad bitch wit’out no flaws
Come to meet me wit’out…

Don’t talk to me ‘bout style, nigga, I’ll ma’fuckin’ embarrass you
Talkin’ ‘bout clothes, I’ll ma’fuckin’ embarrass you
Hollin’ ‘bout some hoes, I’ll ma’fuckin’ embarrass you
Way too cold, I promise you’ll need some Theraflu

(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh) Get the Theraflu
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh) Get the Theraflu
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
(Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh uh) Get the Theraflu ---

Verse 1

My friend showed me pictures of his kids,
And all I could show him were pictures of my cribs.
He said his daughter got a brand-new report card,
And all I got was a brand-new sportscar.

Chorus

And my head keeps spinning,
Can’t stop having these visions,
I gotta keep with it.
2x

Verse 2

Dad cracked a joke, alle the kids laughed,
But I couldn’t here him all the way in first-class.
Chased the good-life, all my life long,
Look back on my life, all my life gone,
Where did I go wrong?

Chorus

And my head keeps spinning,
Can’t stop having these visions,
I gotta keep with it.
2x

Bridge

I’ve seen it, I’ve seen it before.
I’ve seen it, I’ve seen it before.
I’ve seen it, I’ve seen it before.
I’ve seen it, I’ve seen it before.

Verse 3

My god said she’s getting married by the lake,
But I couldn’t figure out who I’d wanna take.
Bad enough that I showed up late,
I had to leave before they even cut the cake.
Welcome to heartbreak.

Chorus

And my head keeps spinning,
Can’t stop having these visions,
I gotta keep with it.
2x
And I can- and I can’t stop.
No, no, I can’t stop.
No, no, no, no I can’t stop.
No, no, no, no I can’t stop.

I can’t stop.
Can’t stop.
Can’t stop.

No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

No, no, no, no.
I can’t stop.

…spinning,
Can’t stop having these visions,
I gotta keep with it.---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
