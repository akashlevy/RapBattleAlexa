Uh......This should go out to my dawg Kato....rest in piece baby....he's the Kingpin

[Chorus DMX]

Dawgs that i called my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things i do for my friends
We miss you, Kato! Kato!

[Verse 1]

Started of two dawgs wit the the goals
Nuttin but two dawgs walkin the same road
Two different cultures, but had the same heart
Enjoyed seein the light, but lived in the dark
5th album bumped heads in the park alot
Was a pride brother, didnt like to bark alot
Came correct, when he came, he gained respect
So i gave respect, we shared the same respect
Two names in wreck now on the circles
Two brothers with good heart, but if you start, two brothers that will hurt you
You know how that dirt, hittin four corners
Earh! Earh! Earh! Earh!, right back upon us
God tried to warn us but sometimes we dont see
When i first heard im like "this cant be, yall niggaz is buggin
Got the wrong information or suttin, please tell me that these niggaz is frontin
God no!"

[Chorus DMX (Magic)]

Dawgs that i called my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things i do for my friends
We miss you,(We miss) Kato! (you) Kato! (Kato)
Dawgs that i called my friends
(We Miss) Praying (You) for (Kato) all my friends
We miss you,(We miss) Kato! (you) Kato! (Kato)

[Verse 2]

If its ok, let me kick it wit you for a minute
There left unsaid dawg we wasnt finished
Never got to say thank you for bein a friend
Dawgs! for Life! and you, will role to the end
Held dawg down didnt let a day go by
Everytime dawg came to the shy (what!)
I was good, trips out to Phoenix with the scrambling squad
If i come back to Phoenix im like, damn its hard
To accept the fact (Uh), that you wont be comin back (Uh)
But i hope your comin back (Uh), cause i wont accept the fact (Uuhh!)
When you came to New York, You had to come to the crib
And vise-versa (Yeah!), thats just how we did
Remote-contol cars (What!), we would race all day
It was adventure, we would chase all day (Yeah!)
So im not gon say good-bye ma nigga (uh uh)
Instead i would rather (Rather) focus on the time we spent together
Thats what matters (for real)

[Chorus DMX (Magic)]

Dawgs that i called my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things i do for my friends
We miss you,(We miss) Kato! (you) Kato! (Kato)
Dawgs that i called my friends
(We Miss) Praying (You) for (Kato) all my friends
We miss you,(We miss) Kato! (you) Kato! (Kato)

[Verse1]

I need you to save me a spot next to you and the Lord (Aight)
I dont know when im comin but keep checkin the door (Aight)
But while im here, knock on wood
I'll make sure your kids remember who they farther was and Val is good (aight!)
Understood how real niggaz move, we dont talk (We dont talk)
But you gon' always have family in New York, believe that (Yeah)

Like the wind (like the wind)
God will take (god will take)
All my sins (all of my sins)
Blown away (will be blown away)
Like the wind (yes)
Like the wind blow

[DMX]
Yea, uh
From 80 school street to way across town
Cats knew how I got down cause word got around
I was that robbery kid with no gun and no mask
Catch a nigga out the door slippin' that's yo ass
Didn't laugh much cause I didn't have much
Life was like a stick half gas half clutch
Meaning half good and half bad
What was good if I caught a good vic if I didn't I was bad
Took it out on my regulars
I come through and if niggaz was broke I took watches and sneakers
Went to jail a few times but that didn't stop me
All it taught me was how not to be sloppy
An older cat robbed me when I was like 10
If anybody wanted to help they should've did it then
But they didn't and all it did was release the beast
So I'm a feast on whatever I come across in the streets

[Chorus - Janyce (DMX)]
Like the wind (like the wind)
God will take (god will take)
All my sins (all of my sins)
Blown away (will be blown away)
Like the wind (like the wind)
Like the wind (like the wind)
blooooooooooooooown

[DMX]
I had a "S" on my chest fuck the vest
Did robberies with some cats and robbed the rest
Other time I came thought with just me and my dog
And clear out the whole fuck block cause we when hard
I bag some niggaz I knew and some niggaz I didn't
I ain't a fuck either way it was no bullshiting
I'm a cruddy niggaz out to get money
And a couple of slugs is the only thing anybody took from me
Run up on a cat smooth like put it in his left ear
Give up the money the jewelry or get left here
Keep thinking it's a game and play let's get popped
See how much fun you having when your heart be stopped
Shut 'em down open up shop oh-oh no-oh blow off a nigga top
Somebody call the cops but it's to late
Cause I'm a hit you in the face
and what will kill you will be something that you ate

[Chorus - Janyce (DMX)]
Like the wind (like the wind)
God will take (god will take)
All my sins (all of my sins)
Blown away (will be blown away)
Like the wind (like the wind)
Like the wind (like the wind)
Blooooooooooooooown

[Jinx]
If pain is love why hide my pain with drugs
Choke off haze and sell attics coke for days
Same clothes and no soup to shave
And I still got a gun on my hip for your open grave
We used to get robbery vics
until my man got killed for his whip on some robbery shit
Then I switched to the weed and start selling crack
But I will pull a steel and put a shell up in ya back
I feel like all my life I was held up in a trap
like if I go to heaven maybe hell will want me back
But all I really want is sperwells up an a lap
And a model bitch sitting with a head in my lap
But since no doe don't spin
and my pant hole got hole within I got to fold ya men
It's obvious I live in a house of sin
I wish I could open up the door and let 'em blow at the wind

[Janyce]
Like the wind
God will take
All my sins
Blown away
Like the wind
Like the wind
blooooooooooooooown---Lyrics submitted by crystal mitchel.

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz - 2X]
When I come thru everything gon' stop
When I come thru everything gon' stop
When I come thru everything gon' stop
Now move.. move.. move.. move..

[DMX]
X comes thru the hood, like here comes trouble
Year of the dog again, first week double
Low in the rider, east coast nigga
Fo' in the rider, street loc nigga
Far for jiggie but like biggie bitches call me big poppa
I got a big dick and I'd a pop her
Yea the kid talk shit but the kid don't front
How ever shit go "give 'em what they want"
I ain't signing shit, love my fans
But Cross this line with the camera in your hands
Cause it could get real ugly real thick
And you like this nigga ?? real quick
Motherfuckin' right, I ain't got time for the small talk
One of us has got to go down, we can't all walk
You know this as well as I do
But I promise you, I'm go hide you and no one will find you

[Chorus (Swizz Beatz)]

[Busta Rhymes]
Stop nigga, hold up, you know I don't quit
You see I'm back and I'm comin' to smash your shit
And ahhla back with the god and bus-a-bus nigga
This time I'm bringin' the shovel so I can come and dig another grave
For all of you bustards what the fuck you think you doin'
I'll put a stop to your function and anybody movin'
And then I'll fuck up production and any crew you flew in
You ain't with me, you against me, The loser side you chosen
Anyway, word to ears, you niggas know I ain't finished
I'll fuck up every hood, and I'm back to handle my business
You niggas thinking you though like you ate a can of spinach
In till we mash on you faggots and make you change up your image
Flip mode in this bitch, Ruff Ryders is with me
You see we back on the block and yes, we runnin' the city
Now you niggas know the flow less ain't controlin' the committee
Nothing' should be movin' unless my crew in it, you fell me

[Chorus (Swizz Beatz)]

[DMX]
If there is money, I want half
Niggas is funny to watch, go head laugh
Ain't nothing to smile about
For real, all niggas is wildin' out
Niggas who pound you out
We found you out in distance
Leg missin', head missin'
Something like 28 days missin'
And you know how the dessert do a nigga
Brake you down quick, residue a nigga
Can't stop the flow, niggas stop and go
When ever I drop, a million out the door
Y'all niggas know, X got to be fucked with
Y'all run around on some dumb shit with a slump dick
Fuck a bitch, you niggas know I don't mind scrapping
When I see you I see you what ever happens, happens
This ain't just rappin', niggas talk a good one
You know what let that go, see me in the hood son

GoodBye

let us pray for those who we have lost,
and know that we miss them for selfish reasons,
Oh lord my god, in thea i put my trust, save me from all them
that persicute me,
and deliver me in jesus's name,

Cause we all go anyways, imma say goobye today,
cause it could be anyday, imma say goodbye today
We've grown in so many ways, but im going to say goodbye today
cause it could be anyday, imma say goodbye today


imma to say goodbye today, cause i dont know when,
we going to cross paths again, until then, im going to be that,
and see that, it speaks the truth, believe that, imma see that,
the reach to you, 

My suffering will not be in vain,
neither will your pain, ever since u past i hear your name
rest in peace, the autumn
we all know cancer cells kill, but if they caught them they could've fought them
if you still be here, right here with us,
we have plenty of time before death came and to get us,
but, what is death like, should i really care,
after looking at it, was life really fair
did you burn any bridges, did you make ammends
did you ask god for forgiveness for your sins,
what is heaven like, if u come back, should you?
if you could communicte from over there, would you

Its questions we ask ourselves, everyday

Cause we all go anyways, imma say goobye today,
cause it could be anyday, imma say goodbye today
We've grown in so many ways, but im going to say goodbye today
cause it could be anyday, imma say goodbye today

So young so gifted, the direction of life was uplifting
when the wind shifting, it took a turn for the worse
it took the best, it come to curse, nigga stressing
took the dog into the hurse, my nigga devon was to young to die
fell out the nest and was way to young to fly,
but that didnt stop fate from happening,
had a time nigga make the devil tkae for what happenen,
god no! why did it go that way? coming from his mans way
why did he go that day, lightly i dear say life goes on
donuts, trillions, girls i say please be strong,
he was supposed to be on the road wit me, 
i wish somebody wouldve came to get me, niggas woulda had to hit me,
but until then my friend, imma say goodbye today cause you never know when

Cause we all go anyways, imma say goobye today,
cause it could be anyday, imma say goodbye today
We've grown in so many ways, but im going to say goodbye today
cause it could be anyday, imma say goodbye today
goobye today, imma say goodbye today,
goodbye today, imma say goodbye today
its okay,we going to try today
say goodbye today,we goin away
your moma say goodbye today, imma say goodbye today
(hey!) i mean this is life,
-saying goodbye
we are born to die, so let me fly
-what it is
Let me fly, i was born to die,
-be good
(repeat "sometimes the pains to much to bare")
im in a better place
-tell we meet again
im in a better place
-i dont know in what form, but we will meet again
See you soon baby! 
-but we will meet again
spread your wings
-you going to shed a tear on this one
fly, ill try not to cry, itll be hard, i just,miss, not having you here
even though i know your in a better place, i just miss having you here
kinda selfish if you think about it, but thats nature, its like , spirit, never dies
even in the end---Lyrics submitted by Gee.

Man are you for real?
You niggas can't be fucking serious
You not for real. you gotta be playing
You better walk away

I run shit here, Y'all just sit here
Do y'all niggas know what it took for me to get here
I'm gonna stay here, earn my way here
You can fuck around if you want but we don't play here
We get through that, run right through that
That's how we do that, y'all niggas knew that
Two albums in one year three albums in two
Didn't I just fucking tell y'all niggas that's how we do
You wasn't even fucking listening when I just said
What I said, you get that, what I just said
I run shit here fuck y'all niggas
Jail what I said I used to duck y'all niggas
Motherfucker I'm grown and that's all to it
Y'all leave a child on his own and I'm gonna do it
Fuck I done did it, shit it
You ain't even half way close to being with it forget it

I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit

I run shit here, what's my name
Getting' down for real fuck my fame
Played too many games and the games gone catch up with you
Fame niggas make stretcha catch up with you quicka
You that nigga oh for real you that nigga
Let me show you how we do that nigga
See, y'all cats are small cats
And niggas like us aren't gonna believe that
We takin all that fall back
Get down, lay down, sit down
Stay down, head round. Hey now
Does a nigga wanna get a little off his mind
I'm a nigga that will hit a nigga off his time
Go off his spine, brains in the air
Flames to the hair cause the game ain't fair
And i'll take it there fuckin' with the right one baby
Got that, we tryin' to light one baby

I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit

I've done shit here my guns spit here
Y'all might live here but I run shit here
Blood sweats and tears for years just to sit here
Think I'm about to let you niggas get here
Cowards are stupid if you wanna see me prove it
Try and take my position watch a quick a nigga lose it
Make you get all my shit and have you fearing for your life
Every time you see me roll up or ride up on a bike
Dressed in all black with my pistol in your sight
But it will be my man in all white that walks up with a knife
I'm a big boy baby I don't play with you thin niggas
Getting my hands dirty when there's beef I send niggas

I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit---Lyrics submitted by Karim Kaloga.
