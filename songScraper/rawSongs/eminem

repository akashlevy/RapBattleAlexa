(It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway.)
Sometimes I just feel like
Quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right
Hit the breaklights
In case of the stage fright
Drawin' a Blank like
(Uhh, But if I fall, It ain't my fault, Breakin eyeballs, My insides crawl)
And I clam up (SMASH!)
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I've just been ripped
So I must been dipped
Or the bustin split
Man fuck this shit yo
I'm goin the fuck home
Rollin my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Rd.

(Chorus)
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man
I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Rd.)
And I'm gone
I don't like where I'm goin
Sorry mama I've grown
I must travel alone
Ain't no followin no footsteps
I'm makin my own
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.

Walkin these traintracks
Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
'Fore I go back to the same crap (SMASH!)
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin to chase rap
Gotta move A.S.A.P.
Get a new plan
Mama's got a new man
Poor little baby sister
She don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, bury's her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother, and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset
Cuz I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I aint grownin two nuts yet
Don't gotta rap my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man
I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell a lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holdin on regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
Wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dog
I'm bailin this trailor tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
Kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby
I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there
The only way I know
And I'ma do that for you
On the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Rd.

(Chorus)

Ya gotta live it to feel it
If you didn't you wouldn't get it
We'll see what the big deal is
Why it wasn't, it still is
To be walkin this border line of Detroit city's limit
It's different, it's a certain significant certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smell, or met an MC
Who's incredible and on the same pedistool as me
But check
Still unsigned
Havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friend's who kick dumb rhymes
Go to work
And servin MC's in the lunch line
But when it come's crunch time
Where do my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow?
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlit
I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little scepticle
Of who I hang out with
I look like a bum
Yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army
Tryin to salvage and outfit
And it's cold
Tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm only stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up
And one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
The city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
Being torn in my limbs
By each one of my friends
Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not what I'm doin
I just blow
My head is a stove top
I just explode
The kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to U-Turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burnt
Ain't no fallin
No next time
Imeet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid
Or be immature
I've got every ingredient
All I need is the courage
Like I already got to beat
All I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly its a search
Suddenly a new verse of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders
Three in the third
I am no longer scared now
I'm free as a bird
And I turn and cross over
The median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd.

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Nikhil.

Just the two of us.. [8X]

[Eminem]
Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

Just the two of us.. [2X]
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. [2X]
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. [2X]
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. [2X]
Just you and I!

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter

Just the two of us.. [2X]
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. [2X]
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. [2X]
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. [2X]
Just you and I!

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

Just the two of us.. [2X]
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. [2X]
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. [2X]
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. [2X]
Just you and I!

Just the two of us.. [4X]

[Eminem]
Just me and you baby
is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your da-da will always be there for you
Your da-da's always gonna love you
Remember that
If you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ASK
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you baby---Lyrics submitted by rachael.

Cause sometimes you feel tired, Feel weak
And when you feel weak
You feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you
You gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that sh*t out of you
And get that motivation to not give up
And be a quitter
No matter how bad you just wanna fall flat on your face

Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps as long as you feel 'em
To the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing them
Cause when I am not then I'm a stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when I stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop.
Amoxacilin is just not real enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
Your coming with me, feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god lives in us.
You hear it a lot, lyrics the shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a f*ck.

[CHORUS]
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this sh*t till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out
I'ma rip this sh*t till my bone collapse.

Music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when your real
and you spit and people are feeling your sh*t.
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
cause you may never get it again.
So while you’re in it try to get as much sh*t as you can
and when your run is over just admit when its at its end.
Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half this sh*t that gets in.
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from Outcast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy, so when I’m not put on this list the sh*t does not offend me.
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's bothering me.
Even though half you people got a f*cking problem with me.
You hate it but you know respect you’ve got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.

[CHORUS]

Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC’s heart
what is he thinking? How not to go against me? Smart.
And its absurd how people hang on every word.
I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict
I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers.
But I don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack I’m launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
Cause I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest.

[CHORUS]

Until the roof
The roof comes off
Until my legs
give out from underneath me

I will not fall,
I will stand tall,
Feels like no one could beat me.---Lyrics submitted by David.

[intro]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Yeah
Too late
I cant keep chasing em
Taking my life like that
Caught in a change
25 to life

[verse 1]
I dont think she understands the sacrifices that I made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I wouldve stayed
But ive already wasted over half of my life I wouldve laid
Down and died for you I no longer cry for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it
Imma take control of this relationship
Command it, and imma be the boss of you now goddamnit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you while ive stayed
Faithfull all the way this is how I fucking get repaid
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you I aint heard you yet
Not even once say you apreciate me I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step
And I wont be coming back so dont hold your fucking breath
You know what youve done no need to go in depth
I told you, youd be sorry if I fucking left
Id laugh while you wept
Hows it feel now, yeah, funny aint it, you neglected me
Did me a favor though my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate but its,

[chorus]
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life

[verse 2]
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that aint good enough you expect me to fold myself in half
Till I snap
Dont think im loyal
All I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side
I have no life outside of that
Dont I give you enough of my time
You dont think so do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why im married to you still man I dont know
But tonight im serving you with papers
Im divoricing you
Go marry someone else and make em famous
And take away there freedom like you did to me
Treat em like you dont need them and they aint worthy of you
Feed em the same shit that you made me eat
Im moving on forget you oh,
Now im special, I aint felt special when I was with you
All I ever felt was dissed
Helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times
Its ridiculus
And still I stick with this
Im sick of this but in my sickness and addiction
Your addicive as they get
Evil as they come vindictive as they make em
My friends keep asking why I cant just walk away from
Im addicted
To the pain, the stress, the drama
Im drawn to this, so I guess imma mess
Cursed and blessed
But this time imma
Aint changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abiss
You screaming as I walk out that ill be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you
You left me off your list
Fuck you hip-hop
Im leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch
And its just

[chorus]

Too late for the other side

(Verse 1)
Your walkin down a horror corridor
It's almost 4 in the mornin
And your in a
Nightmare
It's HORRIBLE
Right there's the coroner
Waitin for you
To turn the corner
So he can corner ya
Your a goner
He's ona ya
Out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run
All you want is to rest
Cause you can't run anymore
Your done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody
Is watchin in the party applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplading my next plot again
Swallowin the Klonopin
While I'm noddin
In and out on the autumn and
If the ramada inn
Holdin onto the pill bottle then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at mcdonalds
With
Blood all over me
Dead bodies
Behind the counter
SHIT
Guess I must of just blacked out again
NOT AGAIN

(Chorus)
It's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

I said
It's 3 am in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

(Verse 2)
Sitting nude in my living room
It's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel
Until I find hannah montana
Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin
Bust all over the wall panel and dismantlin
Every candle on top of the fire place
Mantalin
Grab my flannel and my bandana then
Kiss the naked manakin man again
You can see him standin in my
Front window
If you look in
I'm just a hooligan
Who's use to usin hallicinogens
Causin illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin
Raise the scissors and pins
Jesus when does it end
Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who
Gave these molecules too
Me
What am I gone do
Had the prodical son
The diabolical one
Very methodical
I slaughtered them

(Chorus)
It's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

I said
It's 3 am in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

(Verse 3)
She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

I duck and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I
Had that much fun
Off a half pint of the jack
My last vic and a half
A flashlight
Up kim kardashians ass

I remember the first time
I dismembered a family member
December I think it was
I was having drinks with my cuz
And I wrapped him
In christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin tub
Cut him up into pieces
Then just when I went to drink his
Blood
I thought I outta drink this bath water
That outta be fun
That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me
That might be an artery son
Your blood curdling screams
Just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 am
And here I come
So you should probably run
A secret passage way around here
Man there's got to be one
Oh no there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs
It aint no stoppin me from choppin him up(up)

(Chorus)
Cause it's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

I said
It's 3 am in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

[Eye-Kyu:] Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

[Eminem:] Man what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

[Verse 1: Eye-Kyu]
Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right 
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold digger's succubus , my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch)
We elevated to new heights premeditated 
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperment
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho (now)
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate 
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blasterate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance 
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack 
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop 
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know

[Chorus: Eminem]
So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see

[Eye-Kyu:] Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be the sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see

[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I showered the slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their 
fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack 

[Chorus: Eye-Kyu]
So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become---Lyrics submitted by tom.

(It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway.)
Sometimes I just feel like
Quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right
Hit the breaklights
In case of the stage fright
Drawin' a Blank like
(Uhh, But if I fall, It ain't my fault, Breakin eyeballs, My insides crawl)
And I clam up (SMASH!)
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I've just been ripped
So I must been dipped
Or the bustin split
Man fuck this shit yo
I'm goin the fuck home
Rollin my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Rd.

(Chorus)
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man
I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Rd.)
And I'm gone
I don't like where I'm goin
Sorry mama I've grown
I must travel alone
Ain't no followin no footsteps
I'm makin my own
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.

Walkin these traintracks
Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
'Fore I go back to the same crap (SMASH!)
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin to chase rap
Gotta move A.S.A.P.
Get a new plan
Mama's got a new man
Poor little baby sister
She don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, bury's her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother, and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset
Cuz I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I aint grownin two nuts yet
Don't gotta rap my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man
I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell a lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holdin on regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
Wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dog
I'm bailin this trailor tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
Kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby
I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there
The only way I know
And I'ma do that for you
On the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Rd.

(Chorus)

Ya gotta live it to feel it
If you didn't you wouldn't get it
We'll see what the big deal is
Why it wasn't, it still is
To be walkin this border line of Detroit city's limit
It's different, it's a certain significant certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smell, or met an MC
Who's incredible and on the same pedistool as me
But check
Still unsigned
Havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friend's who kick dumb rhymes
Go to work
And servin MC's in the lunch line
But when it come's crunch time
Where do my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow?
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlit
I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little scepticle
Of who I hang out with
I look like a bum
Yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army
Tryin to salvage and outfit
And it's cold
Tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm only stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up
And one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
The city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
Being torn in my limbs
By each one of my friends
Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not what I'm doin
I just blow
My head is a stove top
I just explode
The kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to U-Turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burnt
Ain't no fallin
No next time
Imeet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid
Or be immature
I've got every ingredient
All I need is the courage
Like I already got to beat
All I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly its a search
Suddenly a new verse of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders
Three in the third
I am no longer scared now
I'm free as a bird
And I turn and cross over
The median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd.

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Nikhil.

[Eminem]
Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great then I falls, my insides crawl
and I clam up (wham) I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit yo, I'm goin the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]
I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

[Eminem]
I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back
the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, and the same pants
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me pigeon holed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it wasn't the skillest
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
Who must I show, to bust my flow
Where must I go, who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with

is pity from no one, the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each on of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
what I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature

Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by saitama.

[Chorus (2x):]
Hi! My name is.. (what?) My name is.. (who?)
My name is.. [scratches] Slim Shady
Hi! My name is.. (huh?) My name is.. (what?)
My name is.. [scratches] Slim Shady

Ahem.. excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class for one second?

[Eminem:]
Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!)
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!)
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? (Huh?)
My brain's dead weight, I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Ummmm..)
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead!"
Uh-uhhh! "So why's your face red? Man you wasted!"
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl dog!)
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!

[Chorus]

[Eminem:]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in Junior High
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler
And stapled his nuts to a stack of papers (Owwwwwwww!)
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial, running over pedestrians
In a space ship while they screaming at me: "LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS!"
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn!)
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!)
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans (Aaahhhhhh!)
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
(Dude, can I get your autograph?)
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ASSHOLE!'

[Chorus]

[Eminem:]
Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!)
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that!)
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive (Huh yup!)
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka -- dare me to drive? (Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops!)
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk (hachhh-too)
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere)
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM? (WAH!)
YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS! (WAHHH!)
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (BANG!)
I'm steaming mad (Arrrggghhh!)
And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?)
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had

[Eminem]
Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you

C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? 
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca? Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water

Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk

[Chorus]
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote

[Verse 1]
Your staring straight into a barrel of hate Terrible fate,
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait Sarah you're late, your train left.
Mascara and eggs smeared on your face
Nights over goodbye, hoe
I thought that I told ya' the spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never shoulda' came within Range of my Rover
Shoulda' known i was trouble soon as I rolled up,
Any chick who's dumb enough out there I blind fold her,
She still comes back to my crib, Must want me to mess with her mind hold up.
She must've took me for some high roller.
But i wont buy her a soda Unless it's rock n' rye cola. (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of fritos I wouldn't let u eat the fucking chip on my shoulder.
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye for ya
Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pulling 5 molars
You get your eyes swole up I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would i buy you a gay ass teddy bear, bitch, you're already bi-polar

[Chorus]
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote

[Verse 2]
Man TIP told me on this hoe tip
Best tip I could give you to hip you
Never let these traits trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love slut, shit
Dig you a hole
Take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
Shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick, its you, but fuck it TIP, it's cool
I'm chillin like a Villain
Like the penguin in it's fucking igloo eating fudgesicles
I'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
before I tie a fucking knot I'd tie you in one bitch
you think this is some Nintendo game how fucking dumb is you
I'll give you some mumps before I split some lump sums with you
So here's a penny for your thoughts but it won't buy you a cheeseburger although a nickle might just get you one pickle
Fuck it, its official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue
there's a bombshell, scud missile
Like I just cuss at you to fucking cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was some motherfucking stud
Slut, this will teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way fo shizzle
I still live like I bought you the Gilbert slot checks stob bizzle
So fuck scissors these checkers are bust like a blood blister

[Chorus]
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote

[Verse 3]
Yeah I guess life is a bitch ain't it TIP
And each one thinks "Say this shit"
Shirt off my back I wouldn't give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I'm giving these hoes a dose of there own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't
This is so bad, put a sticky note to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock come racing in double time
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-mart's like there's an apostrophe "S" on it dog
And they say McDonalds isn't a restaurant well I guess I'm wrong
But if you gonna tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the "F" on dawg

[Chorus]
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
Its never me to get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I'm gonna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until its over and its all she wrote ---Lyrics submitted by Marcus Ramirez.

(Intro) 

Yeah, can't stop now... 
This maybe the last chance I get, to be famous 

(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

(Verse 1) 

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist, they call me Slim Rothelsberger 
I get beserker than a fed up post office worker 
A murker with a mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered 
Like someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter 
For a gangsta, you should of shit your pants when you saw 
The chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel 
I faced her around when his fangs come out, get your brains blown out 
That's what I call blowing your mind, when I come back like nut on your spine 
I'm a thumbtac that you slept on son 
Now here I come screaming "attack" like I just stepped on one! 
Lowering the totem til' he showed 'em, defiance, giant scrotum 
He don't owe them bitches shit, his bridges, he out wrote 'em 
He's so out cold, he's knocked out at the south pole and 
Nobody fucks with him, rigamortis and post-mortem 
He's dying of boredom, take your best rhymes, record 'em 
Then try to thwart him, he'll take your punchlines and snort 'em 
Shit stained drawers, you gon' fuck with the guy that licks the blades of his chainsaws 
While he dips 'em in P.F. chang's sauce 
Game's off homie, hang it up like some crank calls 
You think I'm backing down, you must be out your dang skulls! 
I'm almost famous 


(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

(Verse 2) 

I'm back for revenge, I lost the battle, that ain't happening again 
I'm at your throat like strep, I step strapped with a pen 
Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are distorting my mem-ory 
Some are wrote on a napkin, do what I have to to win 
Pulling out all stops, any who touch a mic prior 
Is not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers 
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the whacko 'for 
I take a shit in his jackolantern then smash it on his porch 
Now get off my dick, dick's too short of a word for my dick 
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism you prick! 
Don't call me the champ, call me the space shuttle destroyer 
I just blew up the challenger, matter of fact, I need a lawyer 
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast 
Beat his ass naked and pee'd in his corner like Verne Troyer 
Ya'll are Eminem backwards, you're menime's 
See he's in a-whole-nother weight class, his slugs your BB's 
Your bean bag bullets, you're full of it, you were dissing his CD's 
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheeties 
No peace treaty's, he's turned into a beast 
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the might DRE 
He's almost famous 

(Hook) 

You dream of trading places, I have been changing faces 
You cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose 
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenceless 
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes 

I just wanna be famous 

But be careful what you wish for! 

(Verse 3) 

Now there he goes, in Dre's studio, cupping his balls 
Screaming the wood off the panelling, cussing the paint off the walls 
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads 
He ain't giving 'em shit, he's scissor pinch a penny so hard 
He'll leave a bruise on the brawn so dark 
You can see the mark when it scars, til Abraham Lincoln is screaming out "AHHH!" 
His metaphors and similies ain't similar to them not at all 
If they don't like they can all get fucked, instead of sucking him off 
They can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by 
Like David Carridy, they can go fuck themselves and just die 
And eat shit while they at it, he's fucking had it 
He's mad at the whole world, so go to hell and build a snowman, girl 
The bullies become bullied, the pussies get pushed 
They better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me 
Cause I ain't looking back only forward, this whole spot blowing 
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it 
And while I'm being poetic, let me get a stork 
And raise the bar higher than my opinion of these women ? 
So bare witness to some biblical shit 
As the cold wind blowing, this world ain't gonna know what hit it, he did it, he made it, he's finally famous!---Lyrics submitted by Tim.

(feat. Taylor Swift)

I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go bezerker than a fed-up post-office worker
A merk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you shoulda shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
I faced her around
But his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowing your mind
When I come back
Like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack
That you slept on son
Now here I come screaming attack like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem till he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His bridges, he out grow'd em

[Taylor Swift]
Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breath whenever you gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand,
Someone distorted my mint
Read some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pull at it all stops, any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the whack before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick
Dick's too short a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentariani sm, you prick
You call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I displaced my clause with enough plaster
To make a cast beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like burn choyder
You're the Eminem backwards, you're mini-me
See he's in a whole nother weight class
He smokes your BB's you beat back bullets
You're full of it; you were just in his CD's
Left at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D. R. E

I'm haunted I'm dead your gone

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started

Come on, come on don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breath whenever you gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oooooh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break.
Never thought I'd see it ---

Attention all units, attention all units
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's
He could be coming at your girlfriend next

[Verse 1:]
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks

[Chorus:]
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!

[Verse 2:]
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
Protectors and be sure that you stand close
Watch each others backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys

[Chorus:]
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!

[Verse 3:]
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him unmercifully
For what he first did to me
It's sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya"

[Chorus:]
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!

[Verse 4:]
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went!
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume

[Chorus:]
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!

[Verse 5:]
Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone

[Police voice:]
Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat
He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?

[Chorus:]
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a backstabber
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!---Lyrics submitted by Scotty.

[Verse 1: Eminem]
It’s like I'm in the dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won’t work
All it takes is one song on the radio you’re right back on it
Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off
And left me so burned, spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I am coming for closure
Don’t suppose an explanation I’m owed for
The way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over
You can just close the chapter
And go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
I’d never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha
'bout to go through’s tougher than anything I have suffered
Can’t think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: "let it go, fuck this"
Heart is saying: "I will once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"

[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can't see the truth
But it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy

[Verse 2: Eminem]
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit
Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it!
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures so long
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me
Have you any idea that shit I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pain of resentment I hold on to
Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you?
The cause to my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I've been driving around your side of the town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low
Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders before hand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost half of a lung
Like you picked up an axe up and then swung
Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back as they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
I hope you hear it we are in a car right now
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP
Just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by Eminem
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you love your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, town is quite near
I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
(Help, police!!)
Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial
New plan Stan
Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, hope you can swim good!
Now say you hate homos again!

[Outro: Eminem]
I also represent anyone normally seen on the end of these jokes of a beat
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Backs to the wall, I’m stacking up all them odds, toilets cock
Yeah ‘cause I’m talking a lot of shit but I’m backing it all up
But in my head there’s a voice in the back and it hollas
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I’m the ringing in your ears
I’m the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I’m your time that’s almost up that you haven’t acknowledged
Grab for some water but I’m that pill that’s too jagged to swallow
I’m the bullies you hate that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you every woman you insult there
With the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
‘Cause Marshall Mather’s the rapper’s persona’s have a facade and 
Matthew and Stan’s just symbolic of you not knowing what you had until it’s gone
‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad but it happens to all of them,
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so!”
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don’t stop after they call you
The biggest laughing stock of rap who can’t call it quits
But it’s time to walk away
I’m ever guilt trip the baggage you had
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
So before you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time, I’m back
Before it fades into black and it’s all over
Behold the final chapter in the saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up the last Mathers’ left off---Lyrics submitted by Kamyab Tizro.

{just pull the plug!}
People say that i'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, i'm just addin to it
They say i'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it
(repeat all 2x)

[eminem]
Hand me an 8
Beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world {i'm here}
And shit on brandy and mase
I'm more than ill
Scarier than a white journalist in a room with lauryn hill {ahhh}
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot
And people goin' feel me cuz i'ma still be
The mad rapper whether i got money or not {yup}
As long as i'm on pills, and i got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin' makin' fun of your yacht
But i would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in the source
And a wardrobe i can afford
Otherwise i might get sent up back-strike in a ford
And you wonder what the fuck i need more vicadive
Everybody's pissin' me off; even a no limit tank looks like
A middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No shit i'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would i kill you and jump in a grave and bury myself

{just pull the plug!}
People say that i'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, i'm just addin' to it

{just let it go!}
(repeat all 2x)

[eminem]
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than rosco beating james tar senior
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {ouch ouch}
I grew up in the wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood, that i used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, i kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that i failed 9th grade
You probably think that i'm a negative person
Don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, i just encourage it {c'mon}
I laugh at the sight of death
As i fall down a cement flight of steps (ahhhh)
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

{just let it go}
People say that i'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, i'm just addin' to it
They say i'm suicidal

Go ahead get mad and do it

[eminem]
My basic disk will make you take a razor into your wrist
Make you satanistic
Make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains
Are rippin' out your skull so bad
And sew you back and be a waste of stitches
I'm not a "role model," i don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and hailey jade is shady's business
And shady's just an alias i made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when gil was payin me to dishwash
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You may be gettin' a bigger attitude than maybe kim's got
And the shit's almost got the same fate that grady's bitch got
I know that "just the two of us" would make you hate me this much
And just the two of us
That ain't got shit to do with us and our personal life
It's just words on a mic.
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a show business pig
But the funny shit is that i still go with the bitch

{just let it go}
People say that i'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, i'm just addin' to it
They say i'm suicidal
Teenagers' newest idol
C'mon do as i do
Go ahead get mad and do it

huhummm diddddly laaaaaaaaaa---Lyrics submitted by sadik.

[Intro]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me
Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me
I'm reaching out for you

[Verse 1]
I'm just so fucking depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump,
but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up, 
in order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided to just pick this pen
Up to try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, 
I need a new outlet
And I know some shits so hard to swallow, 
but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you got to walk a thousand miles

[Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humour
Everything's so tense and gloom, I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room
Just as soon as I walk in, It's like all eyes on me, 
so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that it then it opens the door for conversation, 
like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, 
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, 
tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack, and half of them ain't even funny,
like "AAHHHHH!
Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn!"
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell, hell
We don't gotta trade our shoes, and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

[Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Verse 3]
Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves, and flip them, don't expect no help
Now I could of either just sat on my ass, and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in, and get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never 
did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me, keep making that face til it gets stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standing there holding my tounge, 
tryna talk like BLEGH!
Then I stuck my tounge on that frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson then, 
'cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story, not just based off my description
Cause where you see it form where you're sitting, 
is probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a miles in eachothers shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet

[Chorus]
In my shoes, just to see, what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside eachothers minds
Just to see, what we find, look at shit through eachothers eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you

[Outro]
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me
Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me
I'm reaching out for you

Yeah, to my babies, stay strong, dad will be home soon
And to the rest of the world... God gave you them shoes, to fit you
So put them on and wear them... be yourself man, 
be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny... 
don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful---Lyrics submitted by Elizabeth.

I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Yesterday was the tornado warning, today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake and let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous a**
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out with the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast, the more asserted
Never looking back, may hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve, as you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to to avert a disaster, lucky, no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your a**
And threw dirt on your casket, but you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing at inferno and chant

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

So familiarize with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you from leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that s*** you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building and the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building, you're sealed in
But you're fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin' and you look down
Cause you're so over them you could put the heel of your foot through the ceilin'

As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds, wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place

So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

Feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
With wings I will fly

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light---Lyrics submitted by Larissa Saunders.

I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
Lookin out, cause

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light

I'm standing in the flames
It's a beautiful kind of pain

[Verse 1]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to pick it
But quick to get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Bridge:]
Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long

[Hook:]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berzerk) shake your body

[Verse 2]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khaki's pressed, Nike shoes just crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made Em just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in dang, bang bang
Yes sir Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang dang
P-p-p-pow chicka pow chicka wow wow
Got your gal blowin' up a val-v-v-v-val-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, how, how, how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now hoe

[Bridge]

[Hook]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m.
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, (go berzerk) get your vials

[Scratches]

[Verse 3]
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard, drugs are though that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you a loan, car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers, shit head with a potty mouth
Get the bar soap lathered, Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl you’re fixin' to get your heart broke, don’t be absurd man
You birdbrain baby I ain’t called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you’re a swallow
Word, Rick word man you heard, but don’t be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

[Bridge]

[Hook 2x]---Lyrics submitted by Slither.

Better watch out sucker now I got ya where I want ya,
onslaught, coming and Im packing in my lunch up,
bunch a missile launcher and a bunch a contra,
van van full of ganja, now come on jump,
man stop marchin marshall on my gotcha,
doin’ the cha cha and the kucharcha with a quadri-plegic,
boogieing down to Frank Sinatra,
Lyndsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya,
who da knew the puda do ta me whats its done,
such cynicism when this isn’t in my system,
blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lip son,
so much on my hands, i got to give my kids a fist pump,
Chris-to-pher Reeves swimming in my swim trunks,
Mister, “help me” whats he said to me and then sunk,
women skinning them and cutting them up in chunks,
in comes the woman with cocoa butter skin ones,

[Chorus]
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill,
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-buffalo bill,
skin em up, hym em,
sew em up in those kilts, up in those kilts,
upa upa up in those kilts,
man you don’t want to go up in those hills,
up in those hills, uppa up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of buffalo bill, buffalo bill,
buffa-buffalo bill,

[Verse 2]
Always, you can see em lurking in the hallways,
carcasues of caucasion females in his draw space,
how the hell did he fit em all in such a small space,
hide em in the wall but how long will the dry wall take,
well f-ck it then, I got nothing but time, I’ll wait,
until its dries for the moment i guess your all safe,
after I sand it and buff it I guess that I’ll paint,
my chainsaw’s outta gas my regular saw aint,
now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling,
you can even hear the evil spirits coming from within,
someones in, the back of my damn house rummaging,
its a girl, she looks pretty thin but I want to skin,
been on the hunt again, when will it ever end,
Evelyn why you trying to fight you will never win,
http://www.elyricsworld.com/buffalo_bill_lyrics_eminem.html
severing legs, arms, damn there goes another limb,
pull the lever then trap door, death is evident

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now what you know about Buffalo Bill,
nothing so chill,
f-cking hoe, you better f-cking hold still,
make sure none of that lotion in that bucket don’t spill,
cut em gut em and just keep stuffing those girls,
man I think she had enough of those pills,

sedate her, then I wait her come back later just to clutch on those steel blades
braids, baby when I cut ya dont squeal
I hate the loud noises I f-cking told you,
I keep hearing voices like
wouldn’t you like to go and get ya put ya knife
and push it right through it while ya put ya shishkebab skewer
into a barbecue or would ya do to her what you usually do to a girl who’s skins newer,

[Yoda]
In a World of Sin doer this is turning into a torment tournament of sorts,
Christmas Ornament you are,

[Eminem continued]
I”ll be sure to Gensu ya til there’s no more skin to ya,
boo ya who ya think you f-cking with,
duck because here he comes again,

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by ali.

Intro] 
Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and I don't see either one of us budging 

[Verse] 
I'm withholding my anger 
Though I'd like to be the strangler 
Of this punkass little pussy's puny neck 
It's my right to insist 
That he acknowledge my existence 
But he just displays complete lack of respect 
That's what he says to himself 
As he uses magazines to trash me 
As he sits with both feet up at his desk 
Smokes a bag of his weed 
And starts imagining things 
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed 
And in his jealousy and envy 
It just whirls him in a frenzy 
As he turns on MTV and sees my face 
He don't exist in this world 
So he just twists and he twirls 
Spirals and spins till he runs himself in a race 
And it's destroying him slowly 
Cuz he does not even know me 
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes 
So he just tortures himself 
He has no fortune and wealth 
So he extorts someone else to get his dough 
And now he's acting like a bully 
So he tries to push and pull me 
But he knows that he can't pull me so he's mad 
He has no choice but to scream 
And raise his voice up at me 
Cuz it annoys him to see that I ain't scared 

[Chorus] 
You aint no motherfucking (bully) 
And I aint bowing to no motherfucking (bully) 
I won't allow it, aint no coward to no (bully) 
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully) 
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...) 

And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...) 

[Verse] 
Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies 
No more unfortunately 
There's so many motherfuckers that just are 
They just keep pounding at me 
Now that I'm down with 50 
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja [laughter] 
But his ass is such a puppet 
Irv could stick his whole hand up it 
And just make him say what he wants him to say 
But shook-ass Irv's on a string 
And Irv's so nervous that he 
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay 
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough 
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf 
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down 
But our building's made out of bricks 
So you ain't taking out shit 
I know you just did a song with Bobby Brown 
So now you try to pull a race car 
And it backfires in your face hard 
Cuz you know we don't play that black and white shit 
Plus this guy that you fucked 
When you was ecstasied up 
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch 

[Chorus] 
You must be taking to much (E...) 

[Verse] 
Now what bothers me the most 
About hip-hop is we so close 
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac 
We just lost Jam Master J 
Big L got blasted away 
Plus we lost Bugs, Slayed Son, and Freaky Ta 
It's like a never-ending cycle 
That just seems to come full circle 
Everyone's gotta be so fucking hard 
I'm not excluding myself 
Cuz I been stupid as well 
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart 
But as we grow as men 
We learn to let shit go, but then again 
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand 
We all got reps to uphold 
When someone steps on our toes 
It's no exception, it goes for every man 
But if Irv really gave a fuck 
About Ja like he claims he does 
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs 
But he just keeps feeding him pills 
So if that E doesn't kill him 
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed 
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight 
If the situation escalates 
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game 
And if I get killed for this rap 
I got a million in cash 
That says I will get you back in Halie's name 

[Chorus] 
Irvine, get your boy off that (E...) 

[Spoken] 
Get at me, dawg

Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass"
Hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister
Stanabis, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the mister
Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff-sta
You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canabis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!

[Chorus]
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

Now at first I ain't really understand the shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
It's Can-i-bitch on some "Stan Lives" shit
It creeped me out at first. Man this is sick
For me, being just a sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were tellin' me shit
Like you respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me 
The fourth letter: "Slim, you really startin' to upset me!" 
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me 
The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building 
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me! 
So I went back and read the first few letters that said 
Some shit about a message you left 
Oh shit, that's not an "E" that's an "A" 
This dude wants to leave me a "massage," he's gay!! 
Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre 
We got a bogey! (Marshall I'm on the way) 

[Chorus]
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch 

So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib 
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives 
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship 
Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it 
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost 
We can fly over the border "Let's go" [WOOSH!]
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed 
[BOOSH!] (What was that? Oh) Jermaine Dupri 
Fuck It, keep goin' no time to waste 
Wait, backup hit him one more time in case 
Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car 
Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles 
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate 
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate 
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine' 
"He couldn't have fell off that hard" Ain't no way 
"What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous 
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist" 
Plus he raps with his regular voice [BOOSH! BOOSH!]
[BOOSH! BOOSH!] (What was that?) Pet Shop Boys 
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted 
His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted 
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love 
I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done 
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ 
He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife 
He's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more 
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw 
Hold up, 'Bis quit foldin' up! 
Punch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch! 
Do somethin'! At least one punchline 
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-
ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde 
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond! 
Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars 
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars! 
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs 
Bite another line from Redman's song! 
Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm 
From a midget reaches out from under the car 
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither 
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether 
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again 
(Compton!) Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again! 
Stomp him! (switch feet) Stomp him! (switch again!) 
Dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him! 
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again (Damn)
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again 

[Chorus]
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch

New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch---Lyrics submitted by BYB.

So this is it?
This is what I wished for
This isnt how I envisioned it
Fame to the point of imprisonment
I just this shit'd be different
But something changed the minute that i got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffing it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldnt quit
I just wanted a little bit
Them it turned me to a monster 
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert
I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sowing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was no one for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in between
You either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3 years later they go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didnt have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just aint pass yet
A couple more years that shit'll be illmatic 
And 8 years later I'm still at it
Divorced, remarried
A felon,a father, sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk

[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold
I said be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might ot know
What to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold

I got a letter from a fan that said
He's been praying for me
Everyday, and for some reason it's been weighing on my mind heavy
Cause I don't read every, letter I get
But some thing told me to go ahead and open it but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you
You didn't pray for me when i was local
And as i lay these vocals
I think of all the shit i had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at
I've already told you atleast a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer, but i've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride hasn't it?
Just watching it from an opposite stand point
Man boy's got to look... nuts
And that's the only word I can think of right now on how
To describe this shit
It's just like  a vibe you get
Go ahead  and bop to it just watch what you wish for cause i got the shit

[Repeat Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by joe.

[Intro]
You know technically im not even realy supposed to be here right now
so Fuck it I might as well do the most of it
(Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen) [repeated]
Feels Good
Guess Im lucky
some of us dont get a second chance
But I aint blowin this one
Naah man haha
shit I feel like I can do it again now

Cinderella Man (x4)

Who can catch lighting in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin out the nozzle on a fire hose, cry it and swallow

Cinderella Man (x4)

Smash an hour glass, grab the sand, takes his hands and cup em
Spin around to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff em

Cinderella Man (x4)

[Eminem - Verse 1]
There's a storm comin that the weatherman couldn't predict
I've start to ball prick you better flea cuz I get ticked
it's a rap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch ya to the ground ya trick
It's a trap, fuck my last CD that shit's in my trash
I'll be God damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in a blink of an eye, so betcha I'll last
So keep winkin and blowin kisses cuz ur flirtin with death
I'm destroyin ur livelihood, I ain't just hurtin ur rep
I catch a flow and get goin,
No remorse, I'm showin they slowin, for no one, knowin there is nothing you can do about it
Zeroin in on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I'll shut your lane down, if you can spot the parked in at 2
Arsenic flower, lighter fluid, saliva, what can you do
lyrics courtesy of www.killerhiphop.com
Go get ur crew, hype you up, stand behind you like "woooooooo"
That boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how bout you?
Now guess who....(Hey)
Here's a clue....(Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his nike shoe
It's in ur ass, he's in ur ass, he's all up in ur psyche too
Now, what's his name

Cinderella Man (x4)

[Singing]
If I had a time machine
I'd be...

Cinderella Man (x4)

Music is my time machine
So call me...

Cinderella Man (x4)

[Eminem]
Fuck catchin lighting, he struck it
Screamed shut up at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward

Cinderella Man (x4)

Rewound the future to the present
Paused it, don't ask how
Fuck the past motherfucker he's the shit right now
he's...

Cinderella Man (x4)

Cinderella man sent to fell Shady dey
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane
Raise hell from hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with this Cinderella story,
nor did he come to do the same, or can't afford to be a lamo in this day and age
And at this stage in the game, mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say bye to the old H-I to the new Que Sera
Consider it his last hurrah
The coupe de gras, raise em high, in the sky
People are tryin to bring this place alive
Thanks for bein patient I will make no more mistakes,
shit my Potatoes baked homie the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin weed, yea faggot the stakes are high
Shit I ain't even supposed to be here by the grace of God
By the skin of my teeth and the hair on my nuts I skated by
Now ya'll are on in ice with ankle weights I hate to lie
Now how fuckin irritated are you, how much in ur face am I
And there ain't shit you can do but fear it
Proof is here in spirit and I'm a spittin image I mirror it
When I stand near it, ur pussy lyric I couldn't hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists
Who? (Hey)
Here's a clue (Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater and lost his nike shoe
It's in ur ass, he's in ur ass, he's all up in ur psyche too
now...what's his name

[Chorus]

Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones, there ya' go, yeah, yo', yo'...

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against, I have, i've been protested and demonstrated
against, picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times, sick is the mind of the
motherfuckin' kid that's behind, all this commotion, emotions run deep as ocean's explodin',
tempers flaring from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin', not takin' nothin' from no one,
give 'em hell long as i'm breathin', keep kickin' ass in the mornin', an' takin' names in the
evening, leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth, see they can trigger me but
they'll never figure me out, look at me now, I bet ya' probably sick of me now, ain't you mama,
i'ma make you look so ridiculous now...

[CHORUS]

I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm
cleanin' out my closet, {one more time}, I said i'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you, I
never meant to make you cry, but tonight i'm cleanin' out my closet...

I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it, so before they thrown me
inside my coffin and close it, i'ma expose it, i'll take you back to '73, before I ever had a
multi-platinum sellin' Cd, I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months, my faggot father
must have had his pantie's up in a bunch, cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye,
no I don't on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die, I look at Hailie and I
couldn't picture leavin' her side, even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try, to make it
work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes but i'm only human, but i'm
man enough to face them today, what I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb, but the smartest
shit I did was take them bullets out of that gun, cause id'a killed 'em, shit I would have shot
Kim and him both, it's my life, i'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show...

[CHORUS]

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition, take a second to listen who you
think this record is dissin', but put yourself in my position, just try to envision witnessin'
your Mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen, bitchin' that someone's always goin'
through her purse and shits missin', going through public housing systems, victim of
Munchausen's syndrome, my whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'til I grew
up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya' stomach, doesn't it, wasn't it the reason you made
that Cd for me, ma, so you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma, but guess what, your
gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely, and Nathan's growing up so quick, he's gonna
know that your phoney, and Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful, but
you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral, see what hurts me the most is you won't
admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom, but how dare
you try to take what you didn't help me to get, you selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in
hell for this shit, remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me, well guess
what, I am dead, dead to you as can be...

All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin', and takin' names in the evenin'

See they can trigga me, but they'll neva figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha probley sick of me now

And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
Imma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD

My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side,

Wit her at least for Hailie's sake

Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition

But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I grew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't't't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, MA!
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, MA!
But guess what, ya gettin' olda now and it's cold when yaw lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your FUNERAL
See whets hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yaself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get,
You selfish bitch
I hope you fuckin' burn in in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!

[Intro]
Cause some things just don’t change
It’s better when they stay the same
Althought the whole world knows your name
So on the biggest days they came to see you spit your game
Ooooohhhhhhh
It shouldn’t be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame
Love the game, cold as ice you remain
fuck em’ all, tell ‘em all eat shit, here we go again

So, god damn… is it that time again already
Haha, you don’t look too happy to see me
fuck man, don’t everybody welcome me back at once
All right, fuck ya’ll then

[Verse 1]
You can get the dick, just call me the ballsack, I’m nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch, Dog fall back you mutts
fuck your worms, you never seen such a sick puppy
fuck it a sick duck, I want my duck sick mummy
And my nuts licked, gobble ‘em up trick, yummy
 b**ch you don’t fucking think that I know that you suck dick dummy?
You’ll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit honey
Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it’s funny!
Shawty dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don’t listen to ‘em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker
Motherfucker might aswell let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, cause I’m just a mean cock sucker
This shit is on, cause you wen’t and pissed me off
Now I’m sitting and pissing on everbody
give a fuck if it’s right or wrong
So buck the buddah, light a bong
But take a look at mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song, cmon

[Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
fuck it I’m a loose cannon, Bruce Banner’s back in the booth
Ya’ll are sitting ducks, I’m the only goose standing
I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my d*ck in a circle, but I’m not fucking around motherfucker
I’ll show you pussy footin, I’ll kick a bitch in the cunt
Til it makes her queef and sounds like a fucking whoopy cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin’, you musta mistook me for some sissy
Soft punk looking for some nookie or boosom
Go ahead, fucking hater push me
I told you ain’t no fucking way to shush me
Call me a faggot cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up sissy, G’s up
All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down (shady ease up!)
Man chill, nah I can’t god damnit
Rap is a land fill, drop the anvil
These are shoes that you can’t fill
shit the day that happens the world’ll stop spinning
And Michael J. Fox’ll come to a stand still
During an earthquake, urine in your face
Cause you’re fake, ahh what the fuck, that hurt wait!
Ahh what the fuck, I just got struck by lightening
Alright then I quit, god I give up
Call it evil that men do, lord forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
You can repent but I warn you, if you continue
To hell I’ll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 3]
How long will I be this way? Shady until my dying day
til I hang up the mic and it’s time for me to say
So long, til then i drop the fucking bombs
Like I miss the pass when I went long
If you don’t like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
Oh b**ches don’t like that, homie I’ll be nicer to women
When aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming
lyrics courtesy of killer hip hop dot com
Man I’m a cold soul, I roll solo so
So don’t compare me to them other bums over there
It’s like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah
I’m bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to diss me, I’ll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
That last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I’m as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it’s twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don’t know know know know know know know
I’m as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

(Outro)

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I don’t know, I don’t know what caused, I don’t know what caused me to be this wayme to be this way
I don’t know, I don’t know by I probably be this way til my dying day
I don’t know why I’m so, I’m so cold beat bangs, I don’t need to say
I guess this is how you made me

Ooww Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you’ve all been waiting for ..
In this corner : weighing 175 pounds,
with a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders,
the undisputed, most diabolic villain in the world :
Slim Shady!

Chorus : Eminem
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don’t act like a snobby model you just hit the lotto
Uh-oh Uh-oh, bitch3s hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now where’s the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I notice there’s so many of them
and there’s really not that many of us.
And ladies love us, my posse’s kicking up dust.
It’s on till the break of dawn
and we’re starting this party from dusk

Ok … let’s go

Eminem
Back wit Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you’ll just be another one bit the dust
Just one of my mothers sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt. Lick the fumunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
Its a must I redeem my name n haters get mushed.
Bitch3s lust. Man they love me when I lay in the cut.
Fist the cup. The lady gave her eighty some paper cut.
Now picture us. Its ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the sh-t
gets worse then worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
Its elementary. The elephants have entered the room.
I venture to say we're the center of attention its true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here’s the signal
Of the bat symbol. The platinum trio’s back on you hoes.

Chorus : Eminem
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don’t act like a snobby model.
You just hit the lotto.
Uh-oh Uh-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got clothes
Now wheres the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I notice there’s so many of them
and there’s really not that many of us.
And ladies love us, my posses kicking up dust.
Its on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk.

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

Dr Dre
They see that low rider go by they're, like Oh my!
You ain’t got to tell me why you’re sick cuz I know why.
I dip through in that six trey like sick em Dre.
I’m an itch that they cant scratch, they sick of me.
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA.
Cuz over and above all, its just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends.
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again.
I’ll be dammed, just f*cked around and crashed my Benz.
Driving around with a smashed front end
Lets cash that one in.
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know.
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions
Garage looks like Precision Collision.
Or Maaco beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though

Chorus : Eminem
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don’t act like a snobby model .
You just hit the lotto.
Uh-oh Uh-oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe .

I notice there’s so many of them

And ladies love us,my posses kicking up dust.
Its on till the break of dawn and were starting this party from dusk.

And I take great pleasure in introducing: 50 Cent

50 Cent
It’s bottle after bottle
The money ain’t a thang when you party with me
Its what we into its simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn’t believe
I’m the napalm the bomb the don i’m King Kong
Get rolled on wrapped up and reigned on
I’m so calm through Vietnam ring the alarm
Bring the shaun dawn burn marajauan do what you want
Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man i’m caking you know i don’t give a f*ck
I spend it like it don’t mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherf*cker i’m grown
I stunt i style i flash the sh-t
I gets what the f*ck i want so what I trick
Fat ass burgundy bags classy sh-t Jimmy Cho shoes
I say move a bitch move

Chorus : Eminem

(Chorus)
Cause we came here to set this party off right
let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in thru the front we'll come thru the side
Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without a least sayin' good bye
So all my people on the left all my people on the right scream one last time.

Get your ass up for the Doctor
One more time Get your ass up for the Doctor
come on now, here we go
cliffhanger it's another club banger
got you hangin on the edge of your seat
get on down

Time's up, game's over, you lose i win
bout to show these knuckle heads how to do this here
oooh yeah, new year
next phase begin
look who's got you goin crazy again
i'm a trend, i set one every time i'm in
i go out and just come back in full circle again
if you a fad that means it's something that we already had
but once your gone you don't come back
too bad you're off the map now
radar can't even find you
we stay on the grind
you slip we out grind you
you walk around mad you let your anger blind you
we walk around just playin the violin behind you
enough with all the pissin and moanin, whinin and bitchin
sit observe, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
why i'm sittin multi-platinum, later 3 diamond worldwide
we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin

(chorus)

When Dr. Dre says "Crunk!"  you will get it crunk (get it crunk, crunk, crunk)
and when 50 Cent says "Jump!" you will get on one foot and jump! (jump, jump, jump)
Applause is tremendous , we drop you all the senses
i don't gotta promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches
we keep the party rockin off the hinges
we ain't showin off we're just goin off popular consensus
but critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk, Doc is all washed up
knock it off! Who the fuck is Doc impressin?
Doc is this, Doc is that
you got the wrong impression
you must be on the cockadock cause Doc left you all guessin
so DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?)
we gonna have this muthafucka hoppin in a second (uh huh)
that's why we always save the best cut last
to make the scratch and mix for it like fresh cut glass
We swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
spoke to an generation of angry teenagers whom if it wasn't for rap
to bridge the gap may be raised to be racists
who may have never got to see our faces
grace the cover of Rollin Stone pages
broke down barriers of language and races
just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
to pass the mic don't need ta play back and forth like 
the hot potato game or somethin

(Chorus)

50 Cent come on!
Now snap, hands up
you know how we do, we make the club jump everywhere we go
it's no secret, everybody know 
when Dre's involved there's plenty of money involved 
and plenty honeys involved 
it's sunny Sundays and palm trees, Cali
every day is just another party from The Valleys
all the way to the "make my" alleys, let's rally
Hands up for the Grand Finale
now raise up out your seat, Dre's about to speak
blaze a pound of weed 6 days about the week
you can catch me in the studio bangin out the beatsta
provide ya with the heat that keep blazin out the speakers 
so never say never cause Shady Aftermath together along with G-Unit 
records presents the return of the "The Doc" (O'Shay)
no one can do it better we tear that club up and leave without a shred of evidence
and a...

(Chorus)

yeah! haha Still Aftermath 2006!
And don't worry bout that Detox Album... it's comin! 
We gonna make Dre do it. Ha ha!

( Verse1 )
As i fall deeper into a manic state
Im a prime canidate for the gene to recieve the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of night quil then i salivate
Start off with the night quil like i think i'll just have a taste
Couple sips of that then i gradually graduate 
Too a harder perscription drug called valium like ya that's great
I go to take just one and i end up like having eight 
Now i need something in my stomach cuz i haven't ate
Maybe i'll grab a plate of nachos and i'll have a steak
And you'd think with all i have at stake
Look at my daughters face....
Mommy somethings is wrong with dad i think 
He's acting weird again he's really begining to scare me
Wont shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat dorritos and cheetos 
And he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat 

( Hook )
Sometimes i feel so alone,
I just dont know ,feels like i been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as i go home and close the door,
kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place i do,
But i cant and i wont say i tried but i know thats a lie cuz i dont
and why i just dont know..... 


( Verse2 )
Maybe just a nice cold brew what's a beer 
Thats the devil in my ear i been sober a fuckin year
And that fucker still talks to me he is all i can fuckin hear
Marshall come on we'll watch the game it's the cowboys and buccaneers
And maybe if i just drink half i'll be halfed buzzed for half of the time
Who's that mastermind behind that little line
With that kind of rational man i got half a mind
Too have another half of glass of wine sound acinine
Ya i know
But i never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch im about to fall
I missed the couch and down i go looking like a bouncing ball
Shit must have knocked me out cuz i aint feel the ground at all
Wow what the fuck happend last night where am i
Man fuck am i hungover and god damn i got a head ache 
Shit half a vicodin why cant i ? 
" All systems ready for take off please stand by "

( Hook )
Sometimes i feel so alone,
I just dont know ,feels like i been down this road before,
So lonely and cold, It's like something takes over me,
Soon as i go home and close the door,
kinda feels like deja vu, I wanna get away from this place i do,
But i cant and i wont say i tried but i know thats a lie cuz i dont
and why i just dont know..... 



( Verse3 )
So i take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach and ahh 
A couple weeks go by it aint even like im getting high
now i need it just not to feel sick ya im getting by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if deshaun didn't die 
Oh ya theres an excuse you lose proof so you use 
There's new rules it's cool if it's helpin you to get through
It's twelve noon aint no harm in self inducing a snooze
What else is new fuck it what would elvis do in your shoes
now here i am 3 months later full blown relapse
Just get high untill the kids get home from two homes relax
And since im convinced that im in-somniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so i take 3 naps 
Just to be able to function throughout the day lets see 
That's an ambian each nap how many valium 3
And that will average out to about one good hours sleep
Ok so now you see the reason how come he
Has taken 4 years just too put out an album b 
See me and you we almost had the same outcome he
Cuz that christmas you know the nomonia thing
It was bolognya was it the methadone ya think 
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos 
your vcr tape cases with you ambian cr great places to hide aint it
So you can lie to hailie im going beddy bye whitney baby good night elaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor 


( Hook )
Sometimes i feel so alone,
I just dont know ,feels like i been down this road before,

Detroit vs. Everybody

I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And I think it's changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's weak
The honest gesture, the trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tail flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagle's, an Aries coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My parachute like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
(Real talk) I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
(That's Nickel) Ride around his block
All he knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?
Welcome to Detroit, mothafucka

Boy I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
100 percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy I hit the beat I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet
Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
Got the ball in my hand and the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected, my mama gated community's overprotected
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Or takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though
Don't want to, I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from felon, that's why they call it the D
On your bleeder, ho, reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honor the Phantom stripper pole
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga, them young niggas say
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
And to think y'all hood harder then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Molly
In a blink I'll hit your kisser, bet you ass ain't rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
I had K's in front ya school, but I ain't go to Kettering
Cough up a line, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross eyed like Bernstein’s son
And these niggas try to copy but I hold on this time
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs Everybody

Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like AB filler
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited
But I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC the shit
Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage
You crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track I spank like he just did
(DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit
But Jesus, I can just see why people quit callin' me to do features
And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me
I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch
180 degrees in here trying to wait for the cedar chips
MCs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and genius, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want this kind of static in your life
When I'm makin' you cling to it
They consider tryna reinsulate yah when it's maybe in for another crazy winter
It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde
Sick of bein' underdog
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit
May even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with your relation, changin' it
It's still the same and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter
With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters when you came here?
And I came to kill 'em

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

What up though, it's the godfather Trick Trick
You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on
That means Detroit vs. Everybody
Hey Em let me get that instrumental
Take it down to the hood
Let the little hoodies get this remix crackin'
Detroit---

[Eminem] Hailie
[Halie] What??
[Eminem] Come here baby
Bring daddy his Oscar
[Halie] Okay
[Eminem] We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass
[Halie laughs]

[Swifty]
I'm about to get rid of some hoes it's simple
I put the Murder Inc with lead and I'm not talking about a pencil
Look at what the fuck you dun got into
I see you found your nitch you're just a bitch with a menstral
Claiming you a murderer and spelt it wrong
You put the "E" before the "D" because that's all you on
You on Pac's dick (bitch) you a replica guy if he were still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry bitch keep it real life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins 3 deals that another nigga got you they didn't see
skills
And I ain't playing your a brother getting cheated
And Ja Rule be praying on his cover cause he need it
And you niggas hating shut your mouths
It's just the real niggas ain't buying that shit you put out

[Obie]
Doe Rae Me but we don't sing motherfuckers
So Murder Inc do your thing motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team who expects nothing less then R 'n' B coming from that regime
Regime is a little extreme neck to neck with soldiers motherfucking marines
Ja sold his soul to sing we have witnessed teen on the TV screen chase the dream
Now that you embrace the green don't fuck with the triple beams
You're a motherfucking actor slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billy Holiday how it happen?
Artists with repituares saw him in action, Pac's assassination
Def jam grabbed him, told him reenact him you'll go platinum
They seen it for sure I know that Afeni Shakur don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins
Reenacting her boy saw him click clacking his toy
Match and destroy Shady slash Aftermath in Detroit motherfucker

[Eminem]
Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da
Don't play me cause your washed up, lost your spot
Mama say mama sa Macosaca
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
Doe Rae Me cause we're hot and you're not
Going at me is the only shot you got
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
You can get popped after all that shit you talk

[Kon Artis]
Now we can skip past the mean mugs, get to the slugs
To grievance and the crying and intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga you shook,
You're half of a half-way crook nigga get off X dick go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late great one and when your gone you'll only be the late fake
one
Nigga please stick the script before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch, fucking old ass ignorant innocent looking senior citizen
Built up slap you like renaissance sicitive wait a minute hold on
Is it me or do we look like a banana with braids and clothes on
A bitch made man now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream, holla and curse and go ahead and respond
Pull that pen and pad up out of your purse

[Proof]
Slim set an impulse to get at the wanktas
He told me to let loose and spit at the ganstas
What up gotti were in this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the drama for stucky and bush stones
What's wrong? didn't think were strong with real niggas
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
This real witness you all ain't caught the concept
You're talking non sense to walking bomb threats
Contacts were blown by Benzetta in the Source
Threatening at the boss you're gonna see me on your porch
Now I've got the nerve to try serve on us
But Detroit niggas curve and they stirs to bust

[Kuniva]
Do I gotta get my nigga bugs, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscience and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Caddillac, Pac or that transvestite that dress like a Lil Kim Fox
Your just like a little wind box when I press tight on the trigger of this glock
That's right on the little shit you got left to help you eat
You not Pac's songs without laws will help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying to mock pac your "mock"avelli get your own identity

[Eminem]
Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da
(Don't EVER say my little girls name in a song again)
Don't play me cause you're washed up, lost your spot
Mama say mama sa Macosaca
(Fucking punk pussy, BITCH!)
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
Doe Rae Me cause we're hot and you're not
(I'm gonna fuck you up boy)
Going at me is the only shot you got
(Never again in your mother fucking life)
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
(Gonna shoot the shit outta you little fucking midgets,
Hailie will whip your mother fucking asses)
You can get popped after all that shit you talk

[Obie Trice]
Yeah, that's right motherfuckers
Shady Records, what you know about?
Fuck Benzino, fuck Ja Rule
Nigga, this is Obie Trice right here talking to you mother fuckers
Ja Rule punk ass yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh my God, f-cking Bomboclat
I’m hard as Kenard, the little boy who shot Omar in The Wire,
tie a whore up with barbed wire, nothing but a broad boy,
I’m the real deal, and char-broiler on the bonfire
and Bon Voyage bitch, I’m like Chef Boyar-
-dee in this bitch; send a bomb to my moms lawyer
Im a problem for ya, boy you think your Tom Sawyer,
til I pull you out the f-cking story book and stomp on ya,
f-cking fictitional characters and fariytales,
prepare yourself for Captain America on Ferris Wheels,
but it aint fiction its fact boy beware its real
them lyrics you wield equals zero to a hero’s shield
Mr fly by the seat of his pants parasail
or hit the trampoline bounce and grab a pair of stilts,
and I aint wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothing, no nada,
like your fa-da f-cking ya mada

[Chorus]
Drop the bomb on em,
please don’t drop the bomb on me,
shady please, please dont drop the bomb on me,
drop the bomb on them,
i dont want no dog gone beef,
see aint no reason to sic the dogs on me,
Drop the bomb on em,
please don’t drop the bomb on me,
shady please, please dont drop the bomb on me,
Drop the bomb on em
I dont want no dog gone beef,
see aint no reason to set the dogs on me,

[Verse 2]
Boy, Im the real McCoy,

party’s over kids, kill the noise,
here come the killjoys,
me and Dre steel alloys,
the rap crown royals,
that scalp cowboys
now how that sound for ya
yeah boy you know we about to put it down for ya,
so kick your shoes off,
before you have a sound voyage,
and siyanara see ya f-ckers tommorow,
get some R and R and marinate in some marinara,
and have a coke and a smile, dont make me open a jar,
whip ass on ya, thats the last straw your hoping to draw,
yeah you fresher than most boy, I’m just doper than all boy,
I’m that boy boy, them boys them no up to par
I just show up go up to the stage and blow up the spot,
there aint no boy who can do what I do boy Im a star,
boy, I told you boy, Im a Soldier boy, Im DeShaun,
Holten in this B-tch, Im the Proof boy your a fraud,
I destroy you boy, f-ck around and blow ya to Sod
oh my God boy, you didn’t go there, no you did not,
I got a whole story board for you, boy your da plot,
your gettin got whether you try to avoid it or not,
apology not accepted boy, Detroit is a rock,
we get to beefing, aint no telling at what point it will stop,
all I got to do is point to the spot,
when the bomb drops boy does it drop,
and when it does boy there’s a problem,

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Boy dont jinx yourself,
boy I’m Michael Spinks with the belt,
Stringer bell boy, my name rings bells for itself,
I’m sick as hell boy,
you better run and tell someone else,
Bringin hell boy, sing them telegrams and get dealt
and to that boy who done said it …,
who said he was better,
lyrics courtesy of killerhiphop.com
i bet he never seen Freddie in a Black and red little sweater,
back better than ever,
the chedder shredder the grater the beef grinder
I’ll settle vendettas a little later,
giving haters incubators, think ya made a mistake,
by saying Shady was ghost, I ain’t even close to the gate
you bout a foot in the grave, stay put and behave
Im bout to turn this f-cking place to Beirut in a day
so hey wouldn’t you say Im the sh-t,
couldn’t agree with you more if you were to say my f-cking sh-t doesn’t stink,
shady f-cking aftermath boy the ship doesn’t sink it just floats int he f-cking water
til we fill up the tank,

[Chorus]

All aboard, okay, next stop, my basement… ha ha
I'll meet you down there

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Haters getting mad, they done had enough of shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touche me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsa that a fucking daisy
That's a no-no who even she knows dada's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking A B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karma's in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brain's all haunted cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I ought to just be honest but

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert, and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad, when I call them both faggots
It's all these fucking voices in my head I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'fore I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason's last slut, they're facing
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the weiner schnitzel up his ass, hopped away some-
Body please stop the patient, get the cops to mase him
Homie, I'm the sheisse, pass Doctor Dre some
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussys queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to clean up the crap stains, feck it
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave-I
Think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down motherfucker, try countin' sheep
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!

There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later,
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator

Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fucking-A even got a bidet
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator ---Lyrics submitted by MARSHALL.

[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

[Verse 1]
Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There is vomit on his sweater already
Moms spaggehti he's nervous
But on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drops bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over BLOW!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that
But he's broke, he's so sad that he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home
That's when it's back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody, better go capture this moment
And hope it don't collapse on him

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment you own it you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
Cuz opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better

[Verse 2]
Soul's escapin' through this hole's that is gaping
This world is mines for the taking
Make me king as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring
But superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads got him
He knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold ya nose cuz here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold prada
They moved on to the next shmo who flows
Who nose dove and sold nada
And so the so proper
His toll, it unfolds and I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on
Duh duh doe, duh doe, dah dah dah dah

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
No more games, I'ma change for due called rage
Tear this muthafuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped writin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Pfifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's gettin' even harder tryin' to feed and water
My seed plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a pre-madonna
Baby momma drama, screamin' on her
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot
Another day of monotony 
Has gotten me to the point
I'm like a snail, I've got to formulate a plot
Or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only muthafuckin' option, failure's not
Momma love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot
Feet fail me not
Cause maybe the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]

[Outro]

[Eminem]---

[Ozzy Osbourne]
I’m going through changes
I’m going through changes

[Eminem Verse 1]
Lately I really, feel like I’m rolling for like Philly,
I feel like I’m losing control of myself,
I sincerely apologize if all that I sound like, is I’m complaining,
But life keeps on complicating, an’ I’m debating,
On leaving this world, this evening, even my girls,
Can see I’m grievin’, I try and hide it,
But I can’t, why do I act like I’m all high and mighty,
When inside, I’m dying, I am finally realizing I need help.
I can’t do it by myself, too weak, 2 weeks I’ve been having ups and downs,
Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying,
Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here.
I’m hatin’ my reflection, I walk around the house tryin’ to fight mirrors,
I can’t stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck, only thing I fear, is Hailie,
I’m afraid if I close my eyes I might see her,
Shit…

[Chorus]

[Eminem Verse 2]
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin’ at noon,
Yeah dad’s in a bad mood, he’s always snappin’ at you.
Marshall what happened at you, you can’t stop with these pills,
And you’ve fallen off with your skills, and your own fans are laughin’ at you.
It become a problem you’re too pussy to tackle, get up,
Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled.
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed,
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just swift out and bust,
Nah, it ain’t like Doody to do that,
He wouldn’t fuckin’ shoot at, no-body, he fights first,
But dwellin’ on it only makes the night worse,
Now I’m poppin Vic’s, perks and Methadone pills.
Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it,
Fuckin’ drug dealers hang around me like “yes man”,
And they gon’ do whatever I says when, I says it,
It’s in their best interest to protect their investment.
And I just lost my fuckin’ best friend, so fuck it, I guess then…

[Chorus]

Don’t know what I’m gonna do,
but I just keep on going through changes

[Eminem Verse 3]
My friends can’t understand this new me,
That’s understandable man, but think how bananas you’d be,
You’d be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo.
And everybody’s lookin’ at you, what you want me to do,
I’m startin’ to live like a recluse and the truth is,
Fame startin’ to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low.
I sit alone in my home theatre, watchin’ the same damn DVD,
Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive.
And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin’ pills’ll make me feel alright.
And if I’m still awake in the middle of the night,
I just take a couple more, yeah you’re motherfuckin’ right,
I ain’t slowin’ down for no one, I am almost homeward bound.
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on, dole em out,
Daddy, don’t you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground.
Fuck, don’t I know the sound of that voice,
Yeah baby hold me down.

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, plus somehow I’m pullin’ through.
Swear when I come back I’ma be bulletproof.
I’ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few,
Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth.
Shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through?
I think about the things I would never got to say to you,
I’d never get to make it right, so here’s what I came to do.
Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too,
I still love your mother, that’ll never change,
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together.
Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it,
But I swear on everything, I’d do anything for her on anyday.
There are just too many things, to explain, when it rains,
Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn’t any pain.
But I can’t pretend there ain’t, I ain’t placin’ any blame,
I ain’t pointin’ fingers, heaven knows I never been a saint.
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history,
But just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say,
I miss you self consciously, wish it didn’t end this way.
But I just had to get away, don’t know why,
I don’t know what else to say, I guess I’m…
[Chorus]
[End]---Lyrics submitted by carolina.

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same, old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called "Hi! My Name Is" dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I've went against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain, the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to…

I was a...
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear (the time is near)
Guts over fear (I shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear

Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know

I know what it's like, I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck"
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in that trailer park?
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows
And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song
But I'd rather make "Not Afraid 2" than make another motherfucking "We Made You", uh
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania,
So when they empty that stadium
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone
And to think I was... gone

I was a...
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I will never find a way o-o-out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear (the time is near)
Guts over fear (I shed a tear)
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear---

(feat. Nate Ruess)

[Verse 1: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah.

[Hook: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I went in headfirst
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far?
"Cleaning Out My Closet" and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you 'cause, Ma,
You're still beautiful to me, 'cause you're my mom
Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb equivalent to Chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave)
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat, anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fucking boat, you'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
Further away it drove us, but together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old,
And that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eminem]
'Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
'Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand babies grow
But I'm sorry, Mama, for "Cleaning Out My Closet", at the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though,
'cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own,
But now the medications taken over
And your mental state's deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though
But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have,
'cause one thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me? That you coulda bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them
And although one has only met their grandma once
You pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths,
And I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad
So, Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest,
I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message that I'll always love you from afar
'Cause you're my mama...

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Nate Ruess]
I want a new life (start over)
One without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girl
So I never say, "Goodbye, cruel world."
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die

[Hook]

I want a new life ---

I want you to understand something
that when I come up in this b-tch I want the fans jumping,
I want the fist pumping in the air,
I dont look like a millionnaire,
but I feel like a million bucks,
ladies wont ya fill your cups,
Shadys come to fill ya up,
if your a D or a C cup
you can even be a B
its just me and DRE
youll be in the ER well be strapped with so much TNT,
we may blow no not even CPR from the EMT
could help you to resuscitate
you busters must be flustered wait
you cant cut the mustard, whats your problem cant you bust a grape,
whats my name, shady came and just crushed the game,
its really not even fair to them,
cos they pale in comparisons
so much they might aswell wear a skin,
dont you just wish you could share his pen
cos this sh-ts getting embarrassing,
the fog is stinking the air is thin,
cos he wont even let them try to breathe,
da da di di da di dee, he makes it look so easy,
girl you just hit the lottery,

[Chorus]
now this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on,
and hell breaks loose,
try to restrain us you cant contain us,
we still gonna make a statement no matter what we do,
everywhere we go it seems were looking for any excuse to just cut loose,
so this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
and hell breaks loose,

[Dr Dre]
This is when sh-ts hits the fan,
like it just splattered on stan
this is the only moment that matters,
ya homie rolled in with Mathers,
like chaos erupts Ems in back Dres in the front
so do what we say at once this songs like a singer it hunts (?),

[Eminem]
It makes em stay in a trance
no choice they have to dance,

[Dr Dre]
Its like the play-off just making sure that we stay in the hunt
take a day off of what man you better lay off the blunts
you must be smoking something
you think I aint smoking nothing stay off my nuts,
now hit the floor baby time to wipe away all the rust,
shake all them cobwebs loose,
loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose,
yeah girl shake that caboose
I dont wanna see you try to make no excuse,
DRE is on the loose,
A Mongoose when its comes to the chronic use,
you know I cant stand to lose,
me and my goons are like animals,
we come through like a pack of wolves,
so we came here to retract the roof,
yeah man aint that the truth,
girl your mans like in the booth
definitely back up in this b-tch,
this is when all hell breaks loose,

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Now I know your feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words,
A murderer in the flow, liquid courage im finna blow
as soon as we hit the door power surges head to toe
Im sure to push it as far as words are meant to go,
were in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows,
ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block widcha hoe,
with speakers knocking its 3 0 clock
me and Doc then proceed to drop (?)

[Dr Dre]

[Chorus]
[End]---Lyrics submitted by Paul.

[Intro:]
Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)
My name is Shaaady
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (so long)
My name is Shaaady
I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)

[Verse 1:]
You see that chick in the gym checking me out?
Any second I'm bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a (-I'll)? and I'm wrecklessly wrecking the house
That was suppose to be wreckless, where the heck is it now?
Here's the necklace I lost, right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of your couch
Oh! Jackpot! Yea, 'Open Sesame' mouth
Down the hatchet, the feeling, you can't match it
A rap-tap-tap on your door with the damn wratchet
A tat-tac-tac in the hall with the damn hatchet
A nap-sack-packed with like 40-some Zan-exs
Shorty come back, I'm tryin to score me some lapdances
I'm bout to relapse so maybe pour me some Jack Daniels
Formula 40-40 and 40s with mad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch and back at-ya

[Chorus 1:]
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And are you menstruating baby, my lil friend's waiting to say Hello
The way your titties are wiggling and your booty shakin like Jello
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

[Verse 2:]
My equilibrium is off, must me the Lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday extracurriculum
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun
A fifth of rum and two bottles of 151
51 people asleep in my damn living room
Scuse me hun? But what is your name, Liddy-young?
I want up next to ya naked and uh, did we umm?
Of course we did, but didn't I strap Jimmy hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper but there don't seem to be one
No offense baby girl I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the fact that you, I'm cool, I immediately run like Speedy Gon-
Zalez to see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of threes, I'm fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum

[Chorus 2:]
Well I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And do you happen to have anything on you that make my mood mellow?
Some are open and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello

[Verse 3:]
Oh, those were the days, they certainly were
It's hurtin me to know that I'll be closing that curtain for good
(Word-word, chi-word-word, chi-word-chi-chi-word)
I second that and a third, rush to emergency sur-
-gery to try to flush me because of the drugs that he purged
He's sees the loner getting the three-hundred bucks for these Perc-agains
Buster's getting to be where he lustfully surged it in
Pain it hitting his knee and his muscles 'be hurtin him'
Childishly on the phone tryin to rustle up muscle relax-
-ants for his back and a couple of packs
Since now he's doubling back-wards and he stumblin back
Slipped and fell, hit his back-bone, heard something go crack
Now he's up in the bathroom like he's busting a nap
Almost ended it that soon because of the fact
I'm just busting my own chops while I'm bustin a rap
Resuscitated and re-juiced so fuck it, I'm back

[Chorus 2]

And so I'm sayin...

[Outro:]
Hello (Hello) allow me to introduce myself (myself)
My name is Shaaady
So nice to meet you (So nice to meet you)
It's been a long time (long time) sorry I've been away so long (so long)
My name is Shaaady
I never meant to leave you (Never meant to leave you)---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.

[Intro]
You still love me?
Take this. [2 guns cock]
You ready? 1.. 2.. 3! [2 shots]

[Chorus]
The more you, put me through,
The more it makes me wanna come back to you,
You say you hate me, I just love you more,
You don't want me, I just want you more,
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,
I know it's sad but it's making me happy,
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,
Cause you love me, and I love you more.

[Verse 1]
It's sick, but who could ever predict,
We'd be doin' the same shit,
We say we do it for our baby but we don't,
We do it for us, it's lust,
Cause neither one of us trusts each other,
So we fuck 'til we bust,
Then we cuss each other, out,
We know what it's about,
Shout 'til I throw you out the house,
You throw me out the house,
I throw you on the couch,
Punch you in the mouth,
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother OUT,
And apologize after,
Laughter, pain, it's insane,
We're back in the same chapter again,
And it's sad but it's true,
When I'm layin' here with you,
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do.

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry,
It makes me wanna just take you,
And just throw you on the bed,
And fuck you like I don't even know you,
You fuck other people, and I fuck other people,
You a slut but I'm equal, I'm a mutt,
We're both evil in our ways,
But neither one of us would ever admit it,
Cause one of us would have one up on the other,
So forget it,
We can make accusations, people spread rumors,
But they ain't got proof,
'Til they do it's just the two of us,
It's you and me, cause any chick can say that she's screwin' me,
But you gotta believe me to a degree,
Cause true indeed if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' it,
Yeah I would cause the sex is too damn good,
If I ran who would I run to,
That would be this soft and warm,
So it's off and on, usually more off than on,
But at least we know that we share this common bond,
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on,
I hope, the only reason that I cope,
Is cause of that fact,
And plus I can bust in that,
And that's why...

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I could never understand it,
That's why I don't try,
From junior high until we both die,
It's silly ho why must we try,
Is it really so rough,
That we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff,
Try to pull each other's legs,
Until the other begs,
We're liein' to ourselves,
That's the beauty of it yeah,
Cause we truly love each other,
That's why we always fight,
And all we do is shove each other,
Every other fuckin' night,
And it's clear it ain't gonna change,
It's pent up rage,
We both have,
We both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else,
We've both been,
Someone else's someone else,
Problem is neither one wants help,
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed,
Our family's mixed up,
There's a baby sister in the mix,
And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit,
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit,
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time,
On every song, every lyric, and every rhyme,
All the hoopla, all of the whoopdy whoop,
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopdy doo,
But I won't be made a fool of,
If this is true love,
You wouldn't do what,
You did last time,
You wouldn't screw up,
This time,
Cause this time girl,
I'm telling you what,
You do it again I'm fucking you up,
No matter what...

[Bridge]
What you say, what you do,
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you,
No matter where you run, I'll be right there,
Right behind you, in your nightmares,
All the flowers, and the candy,
All the times that you threw it back at me,
You told me you hate me, you're gonna hate me more,
When you find out, can't escape me whore.

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by hey.

Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
One time for your motherfucking mind, we represent the 313
You know what I'm saying?, cause they don't know shit about this
For the 9-6

Verse 1:
Aiyyo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin, cause they be actin maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming pills or roaches, we sprayed and disinfects
and twist the necks of rappers till their spinal column disconnects
We disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hit's a snare and bass in a track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland...
I'm Infinite

Chorus:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

Verse 2:
Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince, some fruit to stomp,and then two feet to rinse
I greet intensive ladies, I spoil all your fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the only one
Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My a capella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis
And eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite

Chorus:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

Verse 3:
Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So I'm assuming all responsibility 
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool, then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tractical, tactful, track tickle your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit...
I'm Infinite

Chorus:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite(x2)---Lyrics submitted by Alex.

[Verse 1]

I was born with a dick in my brain
Yea fucked in the head
My step-father said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed
"Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?"
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest
The next day my mother said, 
"I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid"
The bastard won't even eat nothing he scared
He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead
Debby don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there stick a fucking cigarette to his neck
I bet you he's faking it
I bet you, I'll bet he prolly wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this of course unless you object
Ah, go fuck his brains out if any is left in his head

[Chorus]

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane

[Verse 2]

You get it? No I just tried to bite my face off
I just got fucking chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw bit the fucking blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face let the thing pop
Took his eye out picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like king kong
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he layed all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants he took every fucking thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yea, maniac that Shady dog
Man that motherfuckers gangsta, ain't he dog?
Shady dog, what be going through that fucking brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waiting for? Sing along.

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don't you know what felch means? (Yea)
Well then tell me, would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp belch and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm saying man? can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my step-father felt me
Fuck a little puppet kick the puppy while he's yelping
Shady what the fuck you saying? I don't know help me!
What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fucking melting!
Marshall I just love you boy I care about your well-being
No dad I said no, I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy I can do it by myself see
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it Pubic Hair on Chelsey
Well this is called Ass-Rape and we're shooting the Jail scene

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by kayla.

[Verse 1 - Eminem]

Jimmy can crack corn, but I don't care
My enemies crack corn, but I don't care
You can be black, white or a albino yeah
You can have corn rows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho, but I know that
Think you just don't say it, then I won't say it
See if you don't brag, then I don't brag
I know I'm bad, as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need y'all to co-sign no shit
You can just keep making them tired old threats
A little bit like the boy you cried wolf yeah
See me, but don't dare to try no shit
Cause you know that somewhere inside those layers
A rattlesnake's right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quiet and strike so fast
Like lightning bolts right out the sky go *blah
From outta nowhere, you might find your career
Come to an *err and I'm just like (Oh Yeah)

[Chorus - Eminem]

See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is D12 at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)

[Verse 2 - Eminem]

Jealous little fucks beg for my attention but
I done told you once, I'm not the kind of attention you want
If I tell you twice, then I won't be so nice
If you keep coming back, that only means you know you lost the fight
They wanna talk shit, let em talk shit, cause they talk shit
Knowing deep down, they really just wanna squash it
Cause no one wants to walk around, stepping in dog shit
And get doo-doo on the shoe again, soon as they washed it
But the pride won't let em, inside's like 'go get em'
And I'm just like 'Why your tryna fight momentum'
We just keep winning, by landslides oh and umm
Shady Limited's in any size yo, Denim
To velour, even our clothing line's on fire
As 50 would say 'Our clothing line's on Fiya'
Meanwhile your minds on us, like mine's on Mariah
And y'all is just like her, you're all fucking liars
But I just keep fucking you, like I fucked her
Right in the ass with KY, yes sir!
So full of joy, boy am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you
'Yea boi don't curr'

[Chorus - Eminem]

See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is G-Unit at, they like (We over here)
And where the fuck we going, we're like (No where)

[Verse 3 - 50 Cent]

Ya homie got clapped on, man I don't care
The cops in my Nana crib, but I'm not there
It is what it is dogg, man life's not fair
Ya friend should've know not to front round here
Listen kid, where I'm from, the wolves smell fear
They'll strip yo ass of your jewels, right here
Man I'ma say this one time, now get this clear
Man you can catch a hot one like outta no where
A beautiful day, without drama is rare
Ya girl's a freak, man sometime we share
Yeah, I wear a condom and you go bare
You prolly heard about me, I'm a shown up player
In the hood politicin, like I'm running for mayor
riding, winding, dining and shining, know what I'm saying
I ain't got time for fucking around, and horseplaying
I'm making hits, my homies taking hits, who's staying

[Chorus - Eminem]

See us on them award shows, we're like (Oh yeah)
Can we get more of those, they're like (Oh yeah)
See us keep blowing up, we're like (Oh yeah)
See Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like (Oh yeah)
See me right up close, you're like (Oh Em)
And where is D12 at, they like (We over here)

Whoah!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
and like, back and forth because ah
this is.. what you thought it wasn't
It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G *coughing in background*
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...

[Verse One: Eminem]
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smocking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm coming out swinging, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The +Proof+ is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Chorus:]
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screaming _Fuck the World_ like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck!!
Talking that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuck!!

[Verse Two: Eminem]
I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Search to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below friezing
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snorting, supporting abortion
Pathological liar, blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an Afghan

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Eminem]
Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screaming like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinning
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfucking style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washing dishes
In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snorting coke and smocking weed again
I'm going up over the curb, driving on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

[Chorus]

[Outro: Eminem]
Hey, fuck that!

Whaaaaaaaa

Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor

Alright Stop!.....Pajama time

[Verse 1]
Come here little kiddies, On my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean rap as in a new case of child molestation accusation
(HA-HA-HA-HA-HA)
No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything, but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bunghole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little "poot poot", it's OK! [Fart Sound]
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass

[Verse 2]
Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I dunno what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Crusin' on the freeway
Feelin' kinda breezy
Got the top down, lettin' my hair blow
I dunno where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there
Someone's gonna "touch my body"

Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name girl?
What's your sign?
[Dr Dre] "Man, you must be up out your mind"
DRE! (HA-HA)
Beer Goggles! Blind!
I'm just tryna unwind now I'm

Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance

Oops I mean girl girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world
Alright now lose it

Just lose it
(HA-HA-HA-HA-HA)
Go crazy
(HA-HA-HA-HA-HA)
Oh baby
(HA-HA)
Oh baby, baby
(HA-HA)

[Verse 3]
It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was running butt naked
Down the street screaming
(HA-HA-HA-HA-HA)
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much
I'm not guilty
They said, "Save it, boy we gotcha you on tape
yellin' at an old lady 'Touch my body!'"

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Snap back to reality
Look it's B.Rabbit!
Yo you signed me up to battle!?
I'm a grown man!
Chubba chubba chubba chubba chubba chubbie
I don't have any lines to go right here so, chubba teletubbie!
Fella's (WHAT?!) Fella's (WHAT?!)
Grab you left nut, make your right one jealous (what?)
Black girls
White girls
Skinny girls
Fat girls
Tall girls
Small girls
I'm callin' all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezin' it's the season
Just go (HA-HA-HA-HA)
It's so appeasin'

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world
Alright now lose it

Come here little kiddies, On my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean rap as in a new case of child molestation accusation
(HA-HA-HA-HA-HA)
No worries, papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything, but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bunghole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little "poot poot", it's OK! [Fart Sound]
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world
Alright now lose it
(HA-HA-HA-HA-HA)
Just lose it
(HA-HA-HA-HA-HA)
Go crazy
(HA-HA-HA-HA-HA)
Oh baby
(HA-HA)
Oh baby, baby
(HA-HA)

[Verse 2]
Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I dunno what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Crusin' on the freeway
Feelin' kinda breezy
Got the top down, lettin' my hair blow
I dunno where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there
Someone's gonna "touch my body"

Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name girl?
What's your sign?
[Dr Dre] "Man, you must be up out your mind"
DRE! (HA-HA)
Beer Goggles! Blind!
I'm just tryna unwind now I'm

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world
Alright now lose it
(HA-HA-HA-HA-HA)
Just lose it
(HA-HA-HA-HA-HA)
Go crazy
(HA-HA-HA-HA-HA)
Oh baby
(HA-HA)
Oh baby, baby
(HA-HA)

[Verse 3]
It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was running butt naked
Down the street screaming
(HA-HA-HA-HA-HA)
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much
I'm not guilty
They said, "Save it, boy we gotcha you on tape
yellin' at an old lady 'Touch my body!'"

Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Snap back to reality
Look it's B.Rabbit!
Yo you signed me up to battle!?
I'm a grown man!
Chubba chubba chubba chubba chubba chubbie
I don't have any lines to go right here so, chubba teletubbie!
Fella's (WHAT?!) Fella's (WHAT?!)
Grab you left nut, make your right one jealous (what?)
Black girls
White girls
Skinny girls
Fat girls
Tall girls
Small girls
I'm callin' all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezin' it's the season
Just go (HA-HA-HA-HA)
It's so appeasin'

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy shake that ass
Oops I mean girl girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world
Alright now lose it
(HA-HA-HA-HA-HA)
Just lose it
(HA-HA-HA-HA-HA)
Go crazy

Oh baby

Oh baby, baby

Come on hey hey we goin' to the beach 
grab a couple of toys and let dada strap you in the car seat. 
Where's Mama? 
She's takin' a little nap in the trunk 
Oh that smell dada must have run over a skunk. 
now I know what you're thinkin': 
it's kind of late to go swimmin' 
but you know your mama she's one of those types of women 
who does crazy things and if she don't get her way she'll throw a 
fit 
don't play with daddy's toy knife, honey, let go of it 
and don't be so upset, why you actin' bashful? 
don't you wanna help dadda build a sand castle? 
and mama said she wants to show how far she can float, 
and don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat 
it's just a little scratch it don't hurt, 
her was eatin' dinner while you was sleepin' and spilled ketchup on 
her shirt 
mama's messy, isn't she, we'll let her wash off in the water 
and me and you can play by ourselves, can't we? 
just the two of us (sung) repeat 8-9 times 
there's a place called heaven and a place called hell, 
a place called prison and a place called jail, 
and dada's probably on his way to all of 'em except one, 
'cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson 

and you don't want a brother do ya? (Na) 
maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better, I'll 
explain it to ya. 
but for now we'll just say that mama was real, real bad 
she was bein' mean to dad and made him real, real mad 
but I still feel sad that I put her in time out, 
sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin' to climb out 
I told you it's okay, hey hey, wanna baba? 
take a night-night, nana-boo, goo-goo ga-ga 
humma goo-goo caca, dad'll change your dighty, 
clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty. 
you're dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water, 
'97 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter. 
just the two of us (sung) 
wake up sleepy head we're here, 
before we play, we're gonna take mama for a little walk along the 
pier. 
baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea, 
mama's too sleepy to hear you screamin' in her ear, 
that's why you can't get her to wake, 
but don't worry, dada made a nice bed for mama at the bottom of the 
lake, 
here, you wanna help dada tie a rope around this rock? 
we'll tie it to her footsies then will roll her off the dock. 
ready now, here we go, on the count of three, 
one, two, three...weeeeeeeeee 
there goes mama splashin' in the water, 
no more fightin' your dad, no more restrainin' order, 
no more step dada, no more new brother, 
blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her, 
we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk, 
but first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk, 
just the two of us (sung)---Lyrics submitted by yolanda.

[Mr. Mackey] (Eric Cartman)
And everyone should get along 
Okay children, quiet down, quiet down 
Children, I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day 
His name is Mr. Shady 
Chidren, quiet down please 
Brian, don't throw that (shut up) 
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with Pneumonia (he's got AIDS) 
Good luck Mr. Shady 

[Eminem]
Hi there, little boys and girls (fuck you) 
Today we're going to learn how to poison squirrels 
But first I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (huh?) 
Say hi, Bob
Hi Bob 
Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom 
He don't got a job cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot 
But his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot 
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot 
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock 
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog 
Drags them into the woods and goes straight to the chopping block 
And even if they escaped and they got the cops 
The ladies would all be just so afraid they'd drop the charge 
'Til one night Mrs. Stacy went off the job 
When she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk 
But Stacy knew it was Bob and said knock it off 
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker 
Crazy good as Slim Shady is off the block, uh 
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to give Bob a doctor 
Grabbed Stacy by the legs and chopped them off her 
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her 
But ever since the day Stacy went off the job they never found her 
And Bob still hangs at the waffle diner 
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana 
Doing what it might do to you 
So see if the squirrels warned you, it's bad for you 

[Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]
See children, drugs are bad (come on) 
And if you don't believe me ask your dad (raise your hand) 
And if you don't believe him ask your mom (that's right) 
She'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will) 
So kids say no to drugs (that's right) 
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh huh) 
And there's really nothing else to say (sing along) 
Drugs are just bad, m'kay? 

[Eminem]
My penis is the size of a peanut 
Have you seen it? 
Fuck no you aint seen it 
It the size of a peanut (huh?) 
Speaking of peanuts 
You know what else is bad for squirrels? 
Esctasy, it's the worst drug in the world 
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it 
Kids, two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid 
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back 
So don't get attatched it'll attack every bone in your back 
Meet Zach, 21 years old 
After hanging out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold 
And decides to try five when he's bribed by five guys 
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it 
Suddenly, he starts to convulse 
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive 
And his eyes roll back in his skull 
His back arches up, looks like the McDonalds arches 
He's on Donald's carpet 
Laying horizontal barfin' 
And everyone in the apartment starts laughing at him 
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him." 
And they took it too, so they think it's funny 
So they're laughing at basically nothing 
Except maybe wasting their money 
Meanwhile Zach's in a coma 
The action is over, and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicing yoga 
And that's the story of Zach: The Ecstasy maniac,
so don't eat that, the squirrels say it's bad for you 

[Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]
See children, drugs are bad (that's right) 
And if you don't believe me ask your dad (that's right) 
And if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can) 
She'll tell you how she does him all the time (she will) 
So kids say no to drugs (smoke crack) 
So you don't act like everyone else does (that's right) 
And there's really nothing else to say (uh huh) 
Drugs are just bad, m'kay? 

[Eminem]
And last but not least 
One of the most humongous 
Problems among young people today is fungus 
It grows from cow manure 
They pick it out, wipe if off, bag it up 
And you put it right in your mouth and chew it 
Yum, yum 
And then you start to see some dumb stuff 
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em 
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (like what?) 
Like fat women in g-strings with orange hair 
Mr. Shady, what's a g-string? 
It's yarn Clair, women stick them up their behinds go out and wear them 
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms 
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus 
Your tounge gets 
All swolled up, like a cow's tongue (How come?) 
Cause it comes from a cow's dung 
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact 
But your mom and dad know
That's all that I'm good at 
But don't be me 
Cause if you grow up and go and OD 
They're gonna come for me, and I'm gonna have to grow a goatee 
And get a disguise and hide 
Cause it'll be my fault 
So don't drugs and do exactly as I don't, because I'm bad for you 

[Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]
See children, drugs are bad (uh huh) 
And if you don't believe me ask your dad (put that down) 
And if you don't believe him ask your mom (you can ask) 
She'll tell you how she does him all the time (and she will) 
So kids say no to drugs (say no) 
So you don't act like everyone else does (like I do) 
And there's really nothing else to say (that's right) 
Drugs are just bad, m'kay? 

[Mr. Mackey] (Eric Cartman)
Come on children
clap along(SHUT UP!)
Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin dick!)
Drugs are just bad drugs are just bad(South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs (Suck my motherfuckin penis!)
so there'll be more for me (Hippie! God damnit!)
(Mushrooms killed Kenny!....Ewww, ahhh!)
(So, fucked up, right now..)---Lyrics submitted by Hert.

Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
Because I don't belong in this world
That’s why I'm scoffing at authority, defying often
Flying off at the handle with my mom, no dad
So I’m non complying at home, at school I’m just shy and awkward
And no I don’t need no goddamn psychologist
Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve them
I’m outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself
Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet
Trying not to be noticed because I'm crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
And he said that I eyeballed him

And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from
All the wars that are fought
Inside your world
Please have faith in my words

'Cause this is my legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired in my nogging?
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind boggling
'Cause I obsess on everything and my mind is small shit
Bothers me but now my father, he said sayonara and then split
But I don’t give a shit I'm fine as long as
There's batteries in my Walkman nothing is the matter with me
Shit look at the bright side at least I ain’t walking
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten speed which I've acquired parts that I
Found in the garbage, a frame and put tires on it
Headphones on, straight ahead and kids tryin to start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even try and put up a fight, it's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about those rhymes I've been jottin'
They are kinda giving me confidence
Instead of tryina escape through my comics,
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
I could be iconic, and my conquest is
Is word to Phife Dawg from a Tribe Called Quest

This is my legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is falling
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
'Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work
Words like this and connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off em
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
Now you shut up bitch, I am talking
Thought I was full of horseshit and now
You fucking worship the ground in which I am walking
Me against the world so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0 and 16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants Falcons and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game bitch I'm supplying coffins
'Cause you dicks, butt kiss, a bunch of Brian Baldingers
You gon die a ball licker I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since 99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can
Suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass
And a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I ain't halting
Till I die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I am me, I'm a fire marshall and this is my

Legacy, legacy, here
This is my legacy, legacy, here
There’s no guarantee, it’s not up to me, you can only see
This is my legacy, legacy
Legacy, legacy---Lyrics submitted by SomeonE.

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down...

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles that I cant handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' Suge
And that was just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it i understand this is business
And this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cause

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Well fuck it, that motherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have Runyan Avenue, soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man
If ya'll can quit poppin' off at the jaws, well then I can
Cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers---Lyrics submitted by terri.

Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted-One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah!
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that
Easy, no
He won't have it , he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo
This this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

[Hook:]
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo

The soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no mo, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner', but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da

[Hook]

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepwritin the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cause man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screaming on and
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot.
Feet fail me not cause maybe the only opportunity that I got

(Feat. Rihanna)

[Hook: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that’s alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that’s alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie

[Verse One: Eminem]

I can’t tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now it’s a steel knife in my windpipe
I can’t breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it’s like I’m in flight
High off of love, drunk from the hate
It’s like I’m huffin paint, I love the more I suffer
I suffocate
Right before I’m bout to drown, she resuscitates, me
She fuckin hates me, and I love it wait
“Where you goin?” 
“I’m leavin you”
“No you ain’t...Come back”
We’re runnin right back, here we go again
It’s so insane, cause when its goin good, its goin great
I’m superman with the wind at his back, she’s lois lane
But when its bad, its awful 
I feel so ashamed, I snap
“Who’s that dude?” I don’t even know his name
I laid hands on her, I’ll never stoop so low again
I guess I don’t know my own strength...

[Hook: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that’s alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that’s alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie...

[Verse Two: Eminem]

You ever loved somebody so much 
You can barely breathe when your wit em?
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit em..
Got that warm, fuzzy feeling, yea them chills used to get em
Now you’re getting fucking sick of lookin at em
You swore you’d never hit em, never do nothing to hurt em
Now you’re in each others face spewin venom in your words when you spit em
You push, pull each others hair, scratch, claw, bit em
Throw em down, pin em, so lost in the moments when you’re in em
It's the rage thats the culprit, controls you both
So they say, its best to go our separate ways
Guess they don’t know you, cause today
That was yesterday, yesterday is over, its a different day
Sound like broken records playin over
But you promised her, next time you’d show restraint
You don’t get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again, 
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that’s why they call it window pane(pain)

[Hook: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that’s alright cause I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that’s alright because I love the way you lie,
 I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie...

[Verse 3: Eminem]

Now I know we said things, did things
That we didn’t mean
And we fall back into the same patterns
Same routines
But your temper is just as bad as mine is
You’re the same as me, 
But when it’s comes to love you’re just as blinded
Baby, please come back, it wasn’t you
Baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn’t as crazy as it seems
Maybe that’s what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I’ll know is that I love you too much, to walk away tho
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don’t you hear sincerity in my voice, when I talk!?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I’m pissed i'll aim a fist at the drywall
Next time, there won’t be no next time
I apologize even though I know its lies
I’m tired of the games, I just want her back 
I know I’m a liar, if she ever tries to fucking leave again
I’m a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire

[Em + Rihanna]
Just gonna...

[Hook: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that’s alright cause I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that’s alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie

I love the way you lie...---Lyrics submitted by Nancy.

[Intro]
Oh my goodness! What have I done! Oh no! I can't believe it!
It's like... I've got the whole world in my palm!
And I'm ready to DROP BOMBS!

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca Rebecca
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
It's my sector, homosexual disector, come again, rewind selecta!
I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lector and a guy sex and I bet ya
I tantlize you and in less than 5 seconds I get ya
They say once bitten, and twice shy
Well I'm next to the guy with nine ecstacy pills and 5 extra
Boxes of ripped condoms in quantities, why yes sir
I took the rest of the lunesta pills from my dresser
It's my kinda vibe, what else should I try Lester
Drop kicked the bitch before her second trimester
Performed a home abortion with dexter then I guess I
Dig a fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it, and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in

I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it, and where does it all end
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends

[Verse 2]
All my westside bitches throw it up
Put a baloon inside your pussy, queef and blow it up
Man I think that he just fell off the teet and show enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwin' up
Man you've seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls, so you know who did it
You know you're with it girl, don't front, oh no you didn't
I won't rape all the pussycat dolls, Nicole you kidding
I pee on Rihanna see man I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room, crazy glueing Madonna to
The lazy boy sofa fold her in two, then sit on her
Imagine the visual for that man, who woulda thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeance
But the chick's so old, she looks like she out lived a life sentence
I never meant this, rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive, it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it, and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in

I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it, and where does it all end
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends

[Verse 3]
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quick sand
Here, you need a hand big man, grab hold of this branch
With both hands, man they don't understand, I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me
Like it's my fault this name rhymes with so many different words, Jeez!
So one last time Mr. Christoper Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse please!
"Eminem, I'm coming to kill you, always hated you and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes, my Superman costume
Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you
You're taking this shit too far, who do you think you are?
Hang my suit up in the armior
Everyday I hate you more and more, throw down the cardboard
Let's breakdance if you think you're hardcore"

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it, and where does it all end
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in

I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it, and where does it all end
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends

The world is mine!---Lyrics submitted by Elizabeth.

Yeah 
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now 
But hey, what daddy always tell you? 
Straighten up little soldier 
Stiffen up that upper lip 
What you crying about? 
You got me 

Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad 
When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had 
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh 
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry 
Cuz you're scared, I ain't there? 
Daddy's with you in your prayers 
No more crying, wipe them tears 
Daddy's here, no more nightmares 
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it 
Laney uncles crazy, aint he? 
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it 
We're all we got in this world 
When it spins, when it swirls 
When it whirls, when it twirls 
Two little beautiful girls 
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze 
I know it's confusing you 
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news 
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems 
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me 
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see 
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did 
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me 
But things have gotten so bad between us 
I don't see us ever being together ever again 
Like we used to be when we was teenagers 
But then of course everything always happens for a reason 
I guess it was never meant to be 
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is 
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep 
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream 

[Chorus] 
Now hush little baby, don't you cry 
Everything's gonna be alright 
Stiffen that upperlip up little lady, i told ya 
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night 
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why 
We fear how we feel inside 
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby 
But i promise momma's gon' be alright 

It's funny 
I remember back one year when daddy had no money 
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up 
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me 
Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em 
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying 
Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job 
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom 
And at the time every house that we lived in 
Either kept getting broke into and robbed 
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college 
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it 
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart 
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart 
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back 
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment 
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara 
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre 
And flew you and momma out to see me 
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me 
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it 
And you and Laney were to young to understand it 
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit 
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it 
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand 
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud 
Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing 
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out 
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now 
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here 
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here 
I like the sound of that, yeah 
It's got a ring to it don't it? 
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment 

[Chorus] 

And if you ask me too 
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird 
I'mma give you the world 
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you 
I'mma sing for you 
I'll do anything for you to see you smile 
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine 
I'mma break that birdies neck 
I'd go back to the jewler who sold it to ya 
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (haha)---Lyrics submitted by trayuka.

All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see 
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did 
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me 
But things have gotten so bad between us 
I don't see us ever being together ever again 
Like we used to be when we was teenagers 
But then of course everything always happens for a reason 
I guess it was never meant to be 
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is 
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep 
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream 

[Chorus] 
Now hush little baby, don't you cry 
Everything's gonna be alright 
Stiffen that upperlip up little lady, i told ya 
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night 
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why 
We fear how we feel inside 
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby 
But i promise momma's gon' be alright 

It's funny 
I remember back one year when daddy had no money 
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up 
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me 
Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em 
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying 
Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job 
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom 
And at the time every house that we lived in 
Either kept getting broke into and robbed 
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college 
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it 
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart 
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart 
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back 
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment 
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara 
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre 
And flew you and momma out to see me 
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me 
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it 
And you and Laney were to young to understand it 
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit 
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it 
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand 
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud 
Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing 
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out 
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now 
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here 
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here 
I like the sound of that, yeah 
It's got a ring to it don't it? 
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment 

[Chorus] 

And if you ask me too 
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird 
I'mma give you the world 
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you 
I'mma sing for you 
I'll do anything for you to see you smile 
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine 
I'mma break that birdies neck 
I'd go back to the jewler who sold it to ya 
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (haha)---Lyrics submitted by trayuka.

[body]
it doesnt take much
for me to raise such a stink up
when motherfuckers hate your guts
you aint even gotta say much
for me to put a pen to a blank sheet of papers
like smearing blood stains with a paint brush
i cant explain what it is my brain does
but however it works its insane
its plain nutz
and it aint just my brain thas dangerous
its a whole combination of things
it takes nutz
and im not affriad to raise the stakes up
i got a million bucks in the banks and 8 trucks
for anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
im patiently waiting for the day
im anxious
to see the look on ya fake mugs
when you thugs go bankrupt
ya drunk
ya aint tough
whatever you drank musta just turned ya into some gangstas
this is me talking motherfucker
this aint drugs
you wanna pop, shit wake-up, then make-up
FUCK THAT
its too late chump now face up
i pray for the day that someone who spits with the calliber that nas and jay does
opens up his jaw to say something or rattle my name off
or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
so i can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw
and give him the surgery that he came for
till i pull the paint off
i never been shot
but i think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth
cause ive always came off
like ja's chain
when they try to rush him and lost
and came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
i dont stop
the only thing i wait for
is day that i dont gotta report to probate court
cause ima give ya all the reason to hate more
cause ive been holding my tounge till i got a sprained jaw
alot of rappers on my list that just aint ja
and ima read that motherfucker off from april
you pussies think i went soft since 8 mile
when i come back ill be shootin more than just paint balls
trust me

[chorus]
monkey see monkey do
dont ever make the first move
just let em' come to you
cause they always gunna see and do what the other one do
so let em' come to you
the rest of us follow suit
monkey see monkey do

if they really want it bad enough well then they gunna come
now here they come as we expected now we just set em' up

Yeah
Yeah girl
Can you hear that?
It's playing our song
Are you sleepy?
Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark are ya?

You hear the beat As it makes ya Not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door It's locked so I go to creep
'round the back with binoculars Not 'cause I want to peep
But because I'm hungry She smells like taco's I want to eat
Visions of hot chocolatey marshmallows Also sweet
With sugar plums Oh look, here comes Marshall he's on your street
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em He's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey A holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast With strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers With Jon Benet Rams
I guess a modern day jack the ripper Is all that I am
My music box

Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
But i can hear u my love, you keep calling me
I want the world to know, you mean the world to me
So when you call me to come, I will answer
Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
I hear my music box, playing a song for me
So wont you whirl around, and do a whirl for me
And want you be my private dancer

I almost look comatose, Who wants to be sobered gross
I foam like a doberman, mouth open I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes and I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know
I put on my mother's make up, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out
The devils upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do, it's locked
I pick it and open it but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig til I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts
It's playing a song, so beautiful and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park

Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
But i can hear u my love, you keep calling me
I want the world to know, you mean the world to me
So when you call me to come, I will answer
Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
I hear my music box, playing a song for me
So wont you whirl around, and do a whirl for me
And want you be my private dancer

I'm fixated on asphyxating and breakin' this little chick's
Neck like a pixie stick
The sick Satan worshippin', bitches get horse-whippins,
I'm in the back, through the back door, slip in
Through the crack leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortition of love, sent from above,
Forced entry, the more wenchy, the more stingy I become
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm just numb
Am I dreamin', is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
I'd had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her
And climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her
with the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha!
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera
Stand back, cuz here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
But i can hear u my love, you keep calling me
I want the world to know, you mean the world to me
So when you call me to come, I will answer
Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
I hear my music box, playing a song for me
So wont you whirl around, and do a whirl for me
And want you be my private dancer---Lyrics submitted by rebecca.
