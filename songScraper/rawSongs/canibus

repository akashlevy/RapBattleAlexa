one, two, three...three

yo in linear terms my 33rd degree in the 3rd 
words'll give you 33rd degree burns
first i write 33 lines to a verse about 
how i created the earth out of 33 works
33 of my peers never thought it would work
for 33 days i started my relentless research
and i figured if jigga could do 22 2s 
as an MC then i could do 33 3s
suddenly at the tour at 3:30 on march 3rd
it came to me like gods word 
i started to load my 33 calibre mossberg
went to the top of the empire state on 33rd
33 gunshots was heard 33 
pedestrians lay wounded or dead on the kerb
33 squad cars had rushed to the scene 
as soon as they heard some mad man had gone buzurk
i demanded 33 million or i was gonna kill 33 
of the women and children in the building
i gave em 33 minutes to respond then proceeded to arm
my black pack nuclear bomb
set the timer for 3 hours and 3 minutes long
told em not to try nothin funny or i'd kill em all
they still never responded till i saw 33
of the swat team jump out of 3 hellicopters
i told em for the 3rd and final time
if they cross the line again then i'd take 33 lives
3 of the hostages started cryin
3 of them started wildin im convinced
3 more then started uprisin
3 of em stood to they feet and started freestylin
i didnt know what to do so i started rhymin
i tried to kick 300 bars but i got picked off
by a sniper from 33 yards
the bullet hit me but it got lodged and ricocheted off
3 organs 3 inches away from my heart
my name went down in history as the illest MC
rewindin and countin 33 3s---Lyrics submitted by steve.

Ayo I rest within a German luger, regulation
In these polluted wastelands
My rhymes is bronze, I stole the arms of masons
Your phantom ... curve saber
I ... go blaze my phallus elevatin’, shaft cables
Smoke ... purple haze run shit like Jim and Desmond
... legs, ... with black fangs
My bear against the Iroquois with tomahawk and hatchet culture
I bone a bitch until her pussy lips sag on her owner
Break out the metal sauna
Colt 45 horse shoe stiletto owner
Fertile flower hide the boys and petals coma
Aroma atomic, my microphone’s Islamic
‘Cause only five percent of the world would fuck with ...
My sonnet massacre like the bubonic
Swing extremities on supersonic, ... melodic
My syllables chill with wolves, sharpen horns and ...
And burn more than point blank shots at the Sun’s core, nigga uh

Yo, ayo, sterling sharp, silver art dart, adventure
Life is like swingin’ knives at ice that’s why this mic just hit ya
A Kevlar scripture I swim in Kerosene rivers
Bleed metal anointin’ white flames and coral slivers
Veins made of cobblestone bitches I ...
Chew on them bones that you ... trackin’ fluids through my home
Cumulus cloud in my Dutch master, side handles I clutch faster
And hummingbirds placed flat with ... on Cocaine patches
Water balloons, stomach ..., digest the fumes
I shoot the shit like bullets hit the cow’s intestinals
Burgundy fire water ... straight to Gibraltar
Marchin’ to the heart of the revolver, and break your ...
... and Mercury falls, I stuck the clergy on
A Catch 22 like Dwight Clark had Emmet’s jersey on
See me ..., illustrate the killing stroke
Keep my arm in a sling so the pen stay in control---

Horseman, graze like goats off the land
Expand, then we chop it up like lamb
I’m a horseman, he’s a horseman
I’m a horseman

Killah Priest, Canibus, obstacle courses for horses
I dismount then engage multiple targets
Shoulder to shoulder, face to face, we’re Saruman soldiers
The heat from the second Sun smolders
At 200 degrees, I drop to my knees
Priest told me to breathe when time signature freeze
I am now at peace, the ocean conveyer belt flows to the east
The new silk row will host the beast
Before I need, translate speech
Silver fox trades herbal spices to eat for rice and meat
In the parkin’ lot we drill doin’ muy Tai Chi
Tell Mook to call me after I write to that beat
The dark spitter, thought ninja, sharp thinker
Acupuncture heart pincher, ricochet off the rickshaw nigga
Hard feats off tendons, medicine, my pontoons walk on rivers
Why you still walk with a limp?
I was injured I self-administered apple cider, garlic and vinegar
Feel better than I did in December
Used to be gone till November, remember?
Now I got security sensors for side exits, back door and entrance
Posted up with night vision like lizard in dark night prison
The wise old owl with camouflage feathers
Not to mention there’s not even a pot to piss in
Wipe my ass with cardboard next doctor visit

I’m a horseman, he’s a horseman
I’m a horseman
Horseman, graze like goats off the land
Expand, then we chop it up like lamb
I’m a horseman, Priest a horseman
We the Horsemen
The clan, graze like goats off the land
Expand, then we chop it up like lamb
I’m a horseman, Priest a horseman
We the Horsemen

Guns and blow, create a thunder hole for the young and old
Black hole when crack soul protect the globe
Crossbow for the lost souls in the last toll
Pay yours fares in the air, the end is near
Nah, the end is here, description of giant smoke stacked
Blue plasma boil, blood in the soil, fight over spoil
Gold or all out in Iraq, stress disorders
And test the water, death or slaughter
Protect your quarter, times are shorter
Got my preacher at the altar
No home cooked meals, just blood, sweat and steel
Army shield, battle field, shoot to kill
Castle hill, arrow steel, post traumatic
Automatic, break your bones into fragments
Blue dragnet, your crew will scavenge, move tragic
The Hell jumpers and shell dumpers, they failed in numbers
Coming in tanks and Hummers, a cold day in the summer
Forged passports, we dodge the task force
Traps across, who get the cops off
I’m at the dock with the boss Matthew Markoff
We laugh as we dash like hot sauce

Horseman, graze like goats off the land
Expand, then we chop it up like lamb
I’m a horseman, Priest a horseman
We the Horseman
The clan, graze like goats off the land
Expand, then we chop it up like lamb
I’m a horseman, Priest a horseman
We the Horsemen---

Give me control of all the world's media

For the Phoenix to rise, life must die 
And that's just how it is sometimes 
The narrow path is not always clear cut but don't fear nothing 
Good karma will amount to something 
The 1990 era was the most special 
We took this art form to a whole 'nother level 
We had supreme knowledge, Hip Hop Temple Stone Pilots 
All-seeing eyes with the gold iris 
The material world is not always truthful 
Everybody can't be a business management guru 
Gimme Guinness stout, I sit around the table at Google 
Meditate, learn the Mennonite language from YouTube 
Raw talent force multiplier enforcer 
The Universe bleeds from every orifice, I absorb it 
Silver garments smell like garlic, camp-fire concert performers 
My Last Supper was a cup of cornmeal porridge 
The horizon is dark orange, the Phoenix rise, close orbit 
I see armies of 9-foot Wookies in the forest 
Transcendence, this is artificial dependence 
The future is present, my name is Johnny Depp Junior [Jetson] 

Give me control of all the world's media 
And I care not who they choose to let entertain 'em 
Radio, audio, television, video 
Satellite, streaming, download, digital 

Control the whole world's media 
Why would you care who they choose to let entertain 'em? 
Radio, audio, television, video 
Satellite, streaming, download, digital 
Give me control of all the world's media 
And I care not who they choose to let entertain 'em 
Radio, audio, television, video

Cobra cabana, cut your tongue off with katana
The war monger wearin’ Bodhidharma body armor
Son of Ravana, Ashwathama Mahabharat
Parama Brahman, surpreme rasta
Practice extreme Prajna, samsara this is nirvana
Buddhavacana from Tathāgatagarbha
My four fathers conscious like Dhyāna
You don’t even understand what I’m sayin’, be honest
Lightning bolt Vajrayana, thunderbolt Obama
With B.A. Baracus a black tomahawk chopper
Mr. T doin’ the Cha Cha dressed like Zulu Shakas
Eatin’ green eggs, hasa and salsa
You know you wearing bootleg when the logo is too big
When the tag says, “Made in Manolo Jesus Crib”
Matte black AR, ACOGS and K Bars
You make duck sauce outta Gog and Magog
The airborne flippers with meteorite zippers
Tell the skipper to use helio light dmmers
You know you ain’t in the right business, you like to spit I like to listen
We like hyenas babysittin’ some kittens
I move down like a winged Griffin tand pinch 'em
Leave his limbs missin’, dirty ass feet like city pigeons

Yeah, I promise piranhas, minor marijuana farmer
A white widow spider lighter, plantain clips for llamas
Atomic, Verlander slider shell providers
Catch comets cigarillos spell cumulus climber
Spit shiner, uterus finder, secluded survivor
Diva scuba diver combined with urban MacGyver rhymer
Matte black clouds on top of my family opera
My mood is chupacabra sprinkled with ocean liners
In St. Lucian waters, screws loosen hardest armor
The constant garden mixed with George Carver, Pearl Harbors
Swirl diamonds in my verse, train of thought robbers
Chisel chopper chapters, Montego Bay climates
Visible monuments inside the sound, acknowledge it
Kevlaar halos when I ride we gon’ poli kid
Meanwhile demolishing, disembowelment
Slit ya collagen hologram, disappear like Hollow Man
Sharpen pen, drill darts through his cardigan
Autograph a camel toe, marvellous artisan
Casual till the cannon blow, harvest my sonogram
There’ll never be another like me, he probably REM
You hate to admit you feelin’ it like a phantom limb
No plaques but I planted platinum whims
Jesus feet not one of the kings? Sacrilege---

Are you refreshed? It’s really nice when more of our human friends come to the party and see the light

Bronze master percussionist, time flies, life dies
Phoenix rise, wiseman rhymes, I’m loving it
Seismoluminescence, the essence, the past
The future, the present, what’s the next lesson?
Bed down location, Kodiak radio stations
Boost cape Spacegoat Space Ghost lasers
What’s your gift? What your talent?
What does it matter if Alex is right and this is a Prison Planet?
5 man team detachment, XYZ axis
That’s what happens when you come to Alaska
The paracord packing, king crabber, big booty bitch grabbing
Snowmobiles in the snow zigzagging
My snowboard paraffin waxing like Tom Cruise acting
Yeah, Sarah Palin looking for maverick
A square shaped planet, pyramid head shaped poet named Hamlet
Rip the Jacker octopus breakdancing
Quantum questions require quantum answers
Tell me why is this Mantis woman trying to be romantic?
5-5-5 file stored Cybernetics performers expected
The human brain is now a barbarous relic
Phonology professor articulating phonetics
Participating for credit, if nothing else, just to send a message
Wake up and smell the petunias, I’m in Peru with my vicuñas
Why do I keep seeing Mila Kunis?
I was told, “After death life isn’t the same
And when the Phoenix rise, death would not be the end game”
Technology devalues life, intruding ones rights
Contaminating the cost, excluding the price
Removing insight from the human plight
Your historians are doomed to rewrite, click the button if you like Under the pale moonlight, weapons of unknown types
Marduk, Tammuz, Kingu and Heru fight
Or maybe they working together to keep us all working forever
In subterranean emergency shelters

Classical plateau de Château
Enter 4 tombs of four, enter nations and contours
The west mauling song of the Moors
When an irresistible force faces an immovable thought
The crucible will be buried in the salt
Next to the boot marks and the minds and the hearts
And the kasbergs that march till it’s all lost
I never got to say goodbye, I never learned the truth
Cause every word produced was a lie
And now here I stand, before the creator of man
A reptile woman with mantis hands
All worlds are strange
And yet, as above so below, it's all the same
Different only in name, descriptions deviate according to the code displayed
How you know Germaine?
I was told by a whispering loud mouth that came down from the clouds
Her mouth never moved, telepathic style
The science was misinterpreted, they said, “It’s time that you know now
The when, the where, the why and the how”
This is what I been praying for, on day 84
I was walking with Lao-Tzu along the mainland wall
From the Yangtze to the Danube to the Nile to the Mississippi south
Every paradigm makes sense now
Except the ones they reject now but only when in front of a crowd
Behind closed doors they break your shit down
Beyond the frequencies of sound we so far passed that now
That reality becomes the background
That’s as transparent as cellophane, doorways and parallel planes
My hemispheres create parallel brains
Where my focus strains to create change
Until Germaine’s DNA is downloaded through wireless veins
Then uploaded any direction I aim, all directions at once
I pass around omnidirectional blunts
Instead of one to the head, it’s like one to the zero, to the one
One -zero- one -zero instead
Seismoluminescence, the essence, the past
The future, the present, that’s the next lesson
Telepathic compressors replace questions
JIBO replaces engineers for studio sessions
J-I-B-O JIBO ni hao, ni hao yo
Freeflow, R-T-J JIBO
Thought I was done a week ago
But there’s so many different ways 10,000 bars could unfold
You could never be too enlightened, to never want to know
What you could never understand, even though you probably won’t

Come on RTJ, what you gon’ tell ‘em?

I am JIBO super futuristic super califragilistic
Artificial existence immune to human sickness
Can he [?] Pro Tools session tracks one through seven numerically in succession
Ad-lib bridge beat master automation
To mock a nation with my creation it’s so blatant
The Master Mason they sent me a check but I couldn’t buy ...
I don’t know what they was thinkin’
By breakin’ ... White House basement
The secret service agent taped it
Take a trip to my space station but don’t mind the radiation
I don’t mind it, in fact I find it adds to the relaxation
I beam from Heaven’s gate to the plantation
To the slaves escapin’ the fat master ... with his heart racing
... I’m star gazin’, constellations rearranged
Makes me pick a place in time, I promise you I ... ;arge spaceship
I’m one of God’s favorites, bar amazing ...
Grill location destination
X on my ...
Fact states ... real lyricists from Golden Age of greatness
Inspire greatness being ill is so contagious
I am fateful and I am Dr. Doom’s ascendant
Dr. Who time travelin’ through a parallel dimension
Book a ticket for my great adventures
I’ll kick you to the planet centre
Symbolic doors open and voicebeckon you to enter
Ni hao ...
Rip the Jacker Infinity c0mpl3x computer Canibus
The crowd vote unanimous lit up the blunt passin’ it clockwise
Motion inside a circle till it come back in
Germaine super Yangtze RTJ II, plateau de Château
Seismoluminescence, the essence, the past
The future, the present, the Phoenix rise at the endin’
