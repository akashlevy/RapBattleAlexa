So come on and chick-ity-check yo self before you wreck yo self

You betta check yo self for you wreck yo self
Cause I'm bad for your health
I come real stealth
Droppin bombs on ya moms, fuck car alarms
Do without one mother nigga wit yo Alpine
Sold it for six-o, always let tricks know
And friends know, we got that indoe
Yo I'm not a sucka, sittin in A House of Pain
And no I'm not the butler, I'll cut ya
Head-butt ya, you say you can't touch this
And I wouldn't touch ya, punk motherfucker
Here to let you know boy, oh boy
I make dough, but don't call me Dough-Boy
This ain't no fuckin picture
A guy or bitch-a, my nigga get wit ya
And hit ya, makin they yack to the neck
So you better run a check

CHORUS

Tricks wanna step to Cube and then they get played
Cause they bitch may pullin out a switchblade
That's kinda trifle, cause that's a knife-o AK-47, assault rifle
Hold the fifty, I'm nifty now, [Watch out now]
I hate motherfuckers claimin that they foldin bank
But steady talkin shit in the holdin tank
First you wanna step to me, now your ass screamin for the deputy
They send you to Charlie-Baker-Denver row, now the runnin up in ya slow
You're God, used to be the Don Juan, now your name is just Twan
Switch it, snap it, rollin your eyes and neck, you better run a check

CHORUS
Big dicks in ya ass is bad for your health

If you're foul you better run a make on that license plate you coulda had a V8
Instead of a trey-eight slug to ya cranium
I got six and I'm aimin em
Will I bus or keep you guessin
Cause fuck you and that shit ya stressin
Bitch, get off the wood, you no good
There goes the neighborhood hooker
Go ahead and keep your drawers 
givin up the claps and who needs applause at a 
time like this, pop ya coochie and ya dead
Bitch is a Miami Hurricane head
Sprung, niggas call her lips and lungs
Nappy dugout, get the fuck out
Cause women like you gets no respect
Bitch, you better run a check

CHORUS

Cause bitches like you is bad for my health
Cause the Lench Mob is bad for ya health

Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at!
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at!

[Verse 1]
I'm in that Hot Thang, gutter lane
Dippin' with that wood grain
So fuckin' hood, mayne
They call me The Boogeyman
In that slow lane, what is your whole name?
I forgot this ho's name, I'll call her Louise Lane
Up on that boulevard, 24's rotate 
Ice Cube comin' through, gotta make the hoes wait
Roll at my own pace - nigga, don't hate!
Fuck all you fat-fuckers leanin' up against my paint!
Ice Cube, I steal a little paint (Movie star!)
Fuck you! Pour a nigga a lil' drink!
That's how it's goin' down out here in California
Listen to my people, when a nigga hit the corner!

[Chorus]
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at!

Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at!
Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Who is the flyest one of all?

[Verse 2]
Now pull in the parking lot
Nigga, find a parking spot
Fired up, everyone want to spark a lot
Puff-puff-pass, we out on Ave.
Lookin' for a big fat ass to harass!
Is it you? Uh-huh, I see you lookin'
When we roll by, pussy still cookin'
Freaks get tooken when they lookin' for stars 
If you don't like my face - bitch, look at my car!
Keep it simple, I told you once befo'
It really don't matter how I get you to the mo'
It really don't matter how I get you in my low
Just hop in, let's go
And let your friends know!

[Chorus]
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at!

[Verse 3]
Do ya thang, girl!
Fuck what they lookin' at!
We the dogs gettin' chased by the pussycat
West Coast, baby - with so much gravy
You should call The Navy, ever since the 80's
I've been doin' good, they been doin' bad
When I see you walk by, I'm pursuin' that
But never chase it, my game is so basic
As soon as I lace it - baby, wanna taste it?
Just face it, put me to the test
Ice Cube would ace it, I'm built for success
Fuck a Rockstar! We wanna party like a Rap Star
In the club, in the house, or the backyard (Yay-yay!)
You make it rain with ones, I make it rain with hun's
And we get lap-dance from nuns 
They put away they crucifix
And they say, "Ice Cube - boy, you the shit!"

[Chorus]
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne

Who is the flyest one of all?
Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Who is the flyest one of all?

[Bridge]
I see you lookin' at me
We don't give a fuck!
What you lookin' at?
We gonna give it up!

[Chorus]
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at! 
Do ya thang, mayne
Fuck what they lookin' at!

[Verse One:]
You know it ain't no stoppin all tha doggs I'm droppin
It's Friday night so everythang is poppin.
I got skin lets spin on da hand,
So let tha games begin.
Yakity yak don't jump back or its on,
Callin up Earl on tha car phone.
Mack 10 just got out of court,
Rollin through tha hood in his super sport ropin Too $hort.
Eighteens got tha rearview mirrors vibratin,
And deep dish daytons.
You know how we do it,
Ain't nuttin to it but tha floss,
Overcrowdin Harrison walks.
'Cuz if ya fuck wit ours,
We leave scars,
Out of G ride cars,
Livin like stars.
Might hit tha highway,
On tha Vegas run fool 'cuz its Friday.

[Chorus:]
Oh yeah, throw ya neighborhood in tha air,
If ya don't care. [x2]

[Verse Two:]
Standin outside on a Friday livin on tha edge,
'cuz we all got 'dem hard heads.
It's seems like we all are waitin,
For a drive by playin tag wit satan.
But we chillin yeah we ready and willin,
Ya hear about tha latest westside killin.
Forty sippin,
Set trippin,
Fo' dippin,
Get tha grip in,
Neva slippin.
BG's tryin tah hang out,
But OG said take ya little ass in tha house.
My big homey just got out,
Used tah be down now he's just crack ad.
He's bout hard as Darth Vada
In his sweat shirt, khakis and Chuck Taylors.
Just see him in the drive way,
Gettin beat like a smoka fool 'cuz it's Friday.

[Chorus]

[Verse Three:]
Why must I be like dat and chase da cat,
Or settle for a hoodrat.
Dookie braids no dreadlocks,
Flyin in and out of jail have a chicken and a cock.
And I love her 'cuz she down,
Tah fuck around wit tha underground pussyhound.
And her ass is big round and wide,
Jacked up makin nigga down tah ride.
Smokin indo,
Playin dat Super Nintendo,
Hear a rat tat tat on my window.
Gave her ass dat pelvic thrust,
Don't trust tha rubber 'cuz its bound tah bust.
In tha oven in tha nappy,
I had on two so I was happy.
'Cuz dat HIV'll make ya dick hang sideways,
And dat ain't cool fool 'cuz its Friday.

[Chorus]

Throw tha west side in da air,
Throw tha east side in da air,
Throw tha south side in da air,
Throw tha north side in da air.
Oh yeah---Lyrics submitted by karina.

[Ice Cube, Verse 1] 

I am the one, that you heard about, read about 
I am the one, that had to take the ghetto route 
I am the one, don't make me pull this ghetto out 
I'm comin' straight from the cave who let him out 
Crazy nigga thought he was gone, but he ain't gone 
Even King Kong took his black monkey ass home 
When I hit the block, watch them scatter like roaches 
So don't be fake, 'cause I know what a hoe is 
Handle my business, no playin' 'cause I'm focused 
You the definition of what a fuckin' joke is 
When they see you comin', they play with your emotions 
Fuck with my emotions and they find you in the oceans 
Yeah I said oceans, yeah I mean plural 
My boy got a knife to turn a boy into a girl 
We'll fuck up your world, no boos to my drama 
We'll include yo mama, if you fuck with my commas 
I ain't tryin' to scary you 
I ain't tryin' to hear you 
I ain't tryin' to control that nigga in the mirror 
I'll I'm tryin' to is bark before I fight 
Before I take you down, might as well be polite 

[Chorus] 

Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come 
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come 
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come 
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come 
Don't tryin' to be no hero, you nothin' but a zero 
Don't tryin' to be no hero, you nothin' but a zero 
Don't tryin' to be a hero, you nothin' but a zero 
A nigga for the people, where ever they go we go 

[Ice Cube, Verse 2] 

Now when I roll through the hood, lil' kids watch my every move 
Tryin' to be a good example, don't make me bury you 
If you sit on my swagger, bitch take some carellflu 
Don't underestimate the damage caused by a '22 
Pop yo' ass right behind the ear within' hear 
Nothin' like a firecracker, hits you like a linebacker 
Don't forget the grind factor, I am a grinder 
And here's a reminder, ain't no tellin' where they find ya 
Now what this got to do with the price of tea in China? 
Nothin' mothafucka just don't act like a vagina 
You won't catch the rath of this hardcore rhymer 
Now you got 55 niggas right behind ya 
Now you wanna talk it out, but we don't negotiate 
Now you gotta do all kind of shit that we know you hate 
Straight from the west and we got to be respected 
Here it's going down, here 'em runnin' for the exit 

[Chorus] 

Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come 
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come 
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come 
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come 
Don't tryin' to be no hero, you nothin' but a zero 
Don't tryin' to be no hero, you nothin' but a zero 
Don't tryin' to be a hero, you nothin' but a zero 
A nigga for the people, where ever they go we go 

[Doughboy, Verse 3] 

See this boy in this bitch gonna ape shit 
Glitch Mob niggas takin' off like a spaceship 
Pace those to Euros, eatin' those green and great chips 
Get 'em by the bag, you can say we Feedo Lay chips 
I'm so hungry that I can eat these niggas faces 
Beat the plastic surgeons givin' Hollywood a face lift 
Off the grape shit, and I'm feelin' like I'm faceless 
The Mob you ain't in, nigga don't say shit 
You ain't nothin' to play with, nigga I beat the basics 
Cock and spray shit, quick to leave a nigga faceless 
Playin' Superman, we get a brave nigga sprayed quick 
Niggas can't fade this, music for the ages 
Because we get it in like Young Crush 
She be payin' big fishin' 
In the water bitch you in the deep end 
Boy I pull you deep in, underneath the deep end 
Nigga have you sinkin', when I hear you creepin', hear you sayin'

Chorus:
I can show you the Palms, the Mall, 
The Taj Mahal to the strip in M.I.A. 
I can show you the waterfalls in Spain and Progue 
To the beach in Saint Tropez
I can show you the world girl the world girl but
Ain't nothin' else like L.A. 
I can show you the world girl the world girl but 
Ain't nothin' like L.A.

Verse 1:
When they come to L.A. they got the wrong impression 
When they come to L.A. they got to learn they lesson. 
When they come to west coast it's such an obsession 
When they come to play it out I'm just an exception 
When they come to you girl I need your affection 
Everytime you walk by you get my inspection 
And all you gotta do now is make your selection 
And it wont be hard to win this election 

Chorus:
I can show you the Palms, the Mall, 
The Taj Mahal to the strip in M.I.A. 
I can show you the waterfalls in Spain and Progue 
To the beach in Saint Tropez
I can show you the world girl the world girl but
Ain't nothin' else like L.A. 
I can show you the world girl the world girl but 
Ain't nothin' like L.A.

Verse 2:
I done been around the world 
I ain't impressed 
I can't wait till we hit LAX 
Tokyo is cool yeah I flew to UK 
But can't nothin' fuck with Cali Forn I A 
Especially LA I'm feelin' the bay 
But nothin' like rollin' down PCH 
Top down west-bound it's all good 
You don't know Hollywood when you from Hollywood 
Let's go to the hood and fuck with the haters 
Then to the staples center hang with the Lakers 
Number 6 is cool but 24's the champ 
And even D Wade and Chris Bosh know that!

Chorus:
I can show you the Palms, the Mall, 
The Taj Mahal to the strip in M.I.A. 
I can show you the waterfalls in Spain and Progue 
To the beach in Saint Tropez 
I can show you the world girl the world girl but
Ain't nothin' else like L.A. 
I can show you the world girl the world girl but 
Ain't nothin' else like L.A.

Verse 3:
The BET Awards and even the Grammy's 
They always pick L.A. over Miami
I love Miami, I ain't dissin' Miami 
But where you u rather get rob for your Grammy
Ain't nothin' like Sunset Blvd 
Compton and Watts if you wanna be hard
We got it all what you thought not at all 
If you sicker then shit then take a Tylenol
It's just me and my woman 
Versus all y'all
And we takin' a bow
For a curtain call
The Angels is lost
They don't wanna be found
If God was lookin' for em I can show him around 

Chorus
I can show you the Palms, the Mall, 
The Taj Mahal to the strip in M.I.A. 
I can show you the waterfalls in Spain and Progue 
To the beach in Saint Tropez 
I can show you the world girl the world girl but
Ain't nothin' else like L.A. 
I can show you the world girl the world girl but 
Ain't nothin' like L.A.---Lyrics submitted by Ty.
