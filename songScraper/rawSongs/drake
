Fuck bein' on some chill shit
We go 0 to 100 nigga, real quick
They be on that rap-to-pay-the-bill shit
And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga
If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up
The 6 ain't friendly but it's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up
I been Steph Curry with the shot
Been cookin' with the sauce, chef, curry with the pot, boy
360 with the wrist, boy
Who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man we really with the shits, boy
Really with the shits
I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy cause I got all the hits, boy
Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga

Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit
Whole squad on that real shit

The other night, Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems, askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
Cause if I run in the game in these, man the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, forreal

Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up---

10 Bands, 50 bands, 100 bands, fuck it, man
Let's just not even discuss it, man
OMG, niggas sleep, I ain't trippin', I'mma let 'em sleep
I ain't trippin', let 'em rest in peace

I can tell ya how it happened
I can tell ya 'bout them safe house nights out in Calabasas
I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package
Who you with? What you claim?
I was payin' mama's rent when was I turning 17
Soda dirty like Diana never clean
My ex asked me, "Where you movin'?" I said, "On to better things"

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house taking no calls
I done hit the stride got my shit goin'
In the six cooking with the wrist motion
Drapes closed, I don't know what time it is
I'm still awake, I gotta shine this year
I could never ever let the streets down
Haven't left the condo for a week now

I've been on a mission, haven't left the condo
This that OVO, that SZN, this that new Toronto
I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone till November then November came
Then I came, right back on my worst behav'
6 God, put both hands together, that's amazin' grace
6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again
Yeah, shout goes out to Nike, checks all over me
I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

I been in the crib with the phones off
I been at the house takin' no calls
I done hit the stride, got my shit going
In the 6 cookin' with the wri-wri-wri-wri---

Let's get it, I can't wait to trick man
It's gonna be so sweet
Summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine
Yeah, the summer's mine

Still like, "Can you hit it with your OVO goose on?"
I'm like, "What are you on?"
Told me that she two on, ha, that's cute we a few on
I could show you what to do in this bitch
Take the addy with the water pop two and then sip
Me, you and your bitch
And we talkin' bout life, love too and this dick
First I had her in the six, then we had her in the six
You know I got another bar for ya
I'mma chill baby, we don't want the devil in this bitch, nah
Got a bad one we could call it Kelly Rowland
Oh she get the jelly rollin', Akinyele in the telly
Cause she open I could tell that she from Oakland
Pasadena, what up?

I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2

A nigga got a woosah, comin' at me never work no matter who try
I got 'em all a cheque without the woo-hah
Flip modes on ya quick got a few sides
Comin' from the 6 side
Where niggas goin' shower posse just to get by
Stay true never switch sides, yea, the game turn me into this guy
Yea, and now every time Drake out
Cameras always flashing tryna put me on the Takeout
Crib in Calabasas man I call that shit the safe house
Thirty minutes from L.A. the shit is way out
But these days that's where I'm stayin'
You can hear it in my voice I'm goin' way in
Yea, OB that my brother like a Wayans
Just know I only show up if you payin', nigga
Yea, I always been on, I always been too on
For like the past five years all these niggas wanna shine
I got the flashlight here man
Bout to hit the gas right here man
Old soul livin' in the past life here man
You, bring the cash right here man
Miracle, sit your ass right here man
Man, You know I hate to wait
That's why I get it first and you get it late
Yea, OVO sound that man that's everyday
It's Young Money Records get the record straight

I love to get on, I love to get 2 on
I love to get on, I love to get 2
She loves to get on, she loves to get 2 on
She loves to get on, she loves to get 2

You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so bad girl, you're so awful
I fuck you right in my office
You go tell your friends you're honest
That's why all your friends are on
You know you made me a promise
We're not in this for commitment
Your man's gone and you don't miss him
Book you flights and confirmation
Southwest Airlines you'll still take it
Hell of a week for you chasing that paper
Even though you're exhausted you're still gonna make it girl
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so thotful
You're so thotful, you're so, you're so
You love to get 2 on

And you know, and you know, and you know
And you know that I put you on
And you know, that's something yo---

Rrrr Ting

I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Watch your motherfuckin' tone, boy, get hurt, boy
Aww, here go another mo'fucker that don't understand
The concept of puttin' money first, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I'm 'bout to hit you with the work, boy
I hate comin' through stuntin' on niggas that I know
Ahh, that's the worst, boy
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You haven't been the man for like a minute
I told you that I'm in it for the long haul
You can really get the business
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
Rolling swishers hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog
I don't pass 'em when I get it
I'll admit it, I'll admit it
You too worried 'bout the bitches
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it
She'll admit it, she'll admit it
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished
I hear the talk on road is I'm the shit, boy
Phone call back home, shit is hot up in the 6, boy
Shit hot up in the 6 right now, shit hot up in the 6, boy
Shit is hot up in the 6 right now
Come see us and get it fixed, boy
Black Benz on the road, boy, already had a Rolls Royce
Sold a couple Bentley last week, them were my old toys
I give a fuck about old boy
I give a fuck about his squad, boy
I give a fuck about your mob, boy
I'm the real 6 God, boy
I'm about to say a true thing
I'm about to say a true thing
You was poppin' back when Usher wore a U-chain
God damn, you changed
I put it on 'erything, it's a Rrr Ting
It's a OVO come through murk things
I know you heard things
Bitch, I know you heard things
Yeah, I know you heard things, I know you
I'm not new to this
Coming from the motherfucking 6 side
I'm not new to this
Niggas wouldn't make it on this side
I'm not new to this
I'm not new, I'm not new
Yeah, I know you heard things
Nobody really likes us except for us
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up
Yeah, my sound got the whole city in your way right now
So I don't give a fuck about what anybody sayin' right now---

Boomin' out in South Gwinnett like Lou Will
6 man like Lou Will, 2 girls and they get along like I'm... (Louuuu)
Like I'm Lou Will, I just got the new deal
I am in the Matrix and I just took the blue pill
No ho shit, no fuckin' ho shit, save that for your shit
I don't need no fuckin' body, I run my own shit
I told yah, thought I told yah, you didn't listen
Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician
I'm on it, I'm like Macgyver, I'm Michael Myers
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin'
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work a night shift

Work the night shift
Young but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
Work, work the night shift

Young, but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing I'm owed
You gotta know
I'm here to fuck with niggas souls, my heart is cold
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin'
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public
Man, I'm back on this again, I'm here again
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced
It's nothin' like this
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
(Louuuu)

If you were worried about where
I've been or who I saw or
What club I went to with the homies
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me
I'm never worried about where
I'm at or who I saw or
What club I go to with the homies
Baby don't worry, I know that they got me---

Yeah, yeah, oh, you gotta love it
Oh, you got, oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep, wanted more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a little little homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried
It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual, my career's like a "how to "manual
So I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, cheer
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we have words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year
Fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to R.I.P. about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public
That's a hotter subject
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow
Once I start it's apparent
I'm with girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But man, oh, you gotta love it
And head to toe I'm Prada covered
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it---

(feat. 2 Chainz & Big Sean)

[Intro:]
I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy

[Hook: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot
It's a lot, fuck that, nevermind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal
Came up, that's all me
Stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me
All me forreal

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring
Dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
She want all the fame
I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me
I said, "Baby girl, fall in line, " ok
Made a million, off of denim
Fuck, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "I'll nigga alert! I'll nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime
I'd be arrested (True)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86
Knew I was a man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans told me don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn
Ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with' us and we don't fuck with' y'all, it's no different over on this side
God damn
Should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself, "You the motherfuckin' man, you don't need no help"
Cashin' checks and I'm bigging up my chest,
Ya'll keep talking 'bout who next,
But I'm about how big as it gets,
I swear ya'll just wastin' ya'll breath,
I'm the light skinned Keith Sweat,
I'm a make it last forever,
It's not your time 'cause I ain't done yet,
Look, just understand that I'm on a roll like Cottonelle,
I was made for all of this shit,
And I'm on the road box office sales,
I'm getting paid for all of this shit,
Ask you to please excuse my table manners,
I was making room for the table dancers,
'Cause if we judging off your advances,
I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
HOE, SHUT THE fuck UP
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rest do
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everythang
Everything but gentle
But I still take my time
Man I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashioned
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit
Good sex, need to hit
Keep a bra on the floor
Year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth
Drink a fifth
Load the nine
Leave you split, in the half
Smoke a half, Need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me
And I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't workin'
Lil' bitch

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh Me. Oh Me. Oh my. I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year, I'll do King of Diamonds, three more times,
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way, sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that, that ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got your shine, I let you eat like that
I been taught never to loan somebody what you need right back
And I need that shit right back (no more free Randy)
I'm blessed than a motherfucker,
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucker
Niggas gettin' nervous, clutchin' they chests like a motherfucker,
Damn that's a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don't listen to ya,
'Cause I don't like being lied to
And that ship won't sail,
And that wind won't guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talkin' through the window,
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man,
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do. ---

Slow emotions
Roller coastin
Like back and forth
Hold it
She pose like its for posters
And I poke like Im suppose to
Take this photo if you for me
she said dont you ever show this
Im to loyal and to focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this she rejoiced this
She said your words gets me open
So I closed it where your clothes

[Jae Millz]
She aint got a man
But she not alone
Miss. Independent

You know a lotta girls be...thinking my songs about them, but
This is not to get confused, this ones for you...

[Chorus]
Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best [x4]
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had [x3]
I say you da fuckin'...

Know you gotta roommate,
Call me when there's no one there,
Put the key under the matt and you know I be over there (Eeeup)
I be over there, shawty I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice,
You could have my heart, or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you were so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringing Drake along
You know that I'm working I be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room,
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume
And until em' girls prove it, I'm the one that never get confused wit

Cause,

[Chorus]

Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit,
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
Play my album, drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy two and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no strips but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffin theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you're the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix, than you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot till a nigga hit the jack pot

Baby you're my everything, you're all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever, I swear I could spend whatever on it
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gone live it up
She make me beg for it, till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say...
You da fuckin' best [x4]
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had [x3]
I say...
You da fuckin' best [x4]
You da best I ever had,
Best I ever had [x3]

YEAHH !!!---Lyrics submitted by najah.

Uh,
I'm just so far gone, 
October's own, 
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone
See my house is not a home, fuck is goin' on
Where did we go wrong,
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone
Meaning if it rains I'm the one it's raining on
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown,
parties that we've thrown
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown
It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown
I'm just in my zone, I call this shit the calm
Yea, but I'm the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne

You know, everything gone be alright, I promise. A
Pologize to you know, to put ya'll in this position and vent to ya'll but...
40 mom always say, "Don't ask permisson, just ask forgiveness"
You know, so... forgive me
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...

Uh,
And life is so insane, 
Look what I've became, 
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain
It's a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that your the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain
Hopin' western union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn, and I could only feel his pain
Cause in memphis tennessee there's only so much to attain
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once a-gain
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain
I'm why yo girl heart is in a slang
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame
As a man I'm just honest as a artist I'm a king
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain
Yea, And see this is the thang
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I Remain

Me, Yea... Uh, I said I call this shit the calm.
But I'm the furthest thing from calm.
I swear I'm puttin' on but they always wanna ask what type of act you puttin' on like... Man.---Lyrics submitted by Andrew.

[Drake]
My name is drizzy
and i aint perfect
but i work hard
so i deserve it
and i belong
right where you see me
aint no offence about it
i aint mistah feeny
nah i got a decent set of manners
and a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner
and i fall in love with girls caught up with superficial glamour
who dress like sarah jessica
and live like princess diana
so often they have addictions
and im the one that'll feed it
but truely you're bad enough that you dont even really need it
you can show up at the party on dirty public transit
and i guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin candids
of you and your posse partying
drinking watch you get handed
with your virgin island tans
all lookin like you just landed
i dont really understand it
im not sure im comprehending it
but these girls are having fun with whoevas money they spendin

Chorus x2
I got to be Unstoppable
I got to be Unstoppable

You don't lie
Ey ey ey ey

[Wayne]
My name is weezy
Im almost perfect
and i work harder than hard workin
bizzare circus
thats where my bar surface
therefore i act a clown
even when im laying on my back
im never backin down
so overstand me
i got a condo in miami
and my doorman is always sandy
and i run louisiana
but ive never pulled a hammy
and i got a condo in atlanta
and i always wear a bandana
and when it comes down to stuntin
you boys is just buttonin
im swinging for the fence
your girl hanging from my dick
your girl sanging too much shit
like ah loli loli pop
she say i get that pussy wetter than a designer shop
she say i get that pussy better
better than her gynecologist
hoe just text me
everybody want some mo dick mo dick
old bitch
young bitch
but ill be like damnnnn
all i got is one dick

Chorus
I got to be Unstoppable
I got to be Unstoppable
Ey ey ey ey
You don't lie
Ey ey ey ey
You don't lie

[Santogold]
I got the talk
The beats and bass
Give me one I'll take it
Make you lose your place,
Tell me I-I-I can play
So I speed up the pace
I break it break it you can't stop me
In this ra-race

I got to be Unstoppable

*[Intro: Drake talking]
Yeah
I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time, like
What it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then, but
I can probably tell you a lil somethin' now

[Verse 1:]
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin', I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels and they silencin' you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here
I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch chrome green diamonds I call it the earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years
It's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap
It's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' dranks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like (vocalizes)
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring 07
Second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is whack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at the dinner table and say "my baby's famous and I knew it"

And it wasn't nothin' to it
I'm drawin' and drawin' till the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out

[Drake: Talking]
Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF

[Singing:]
Closer to my dreams (Miss Andreena Mill)
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah (Yeah man)
I feel it in my sleep (Sing it to 'em baby)
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams

[Verse 2:]
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progress
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video has made everything right with ex (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Too many rappers and not enough-
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
They can't
Play pen drop out
The gray ten drop out
Summer 05 with the gray Benz drop out
Charcoal charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the awful dodger
Showed her I'mma
I told her I'mma
Bout to get my run-on so hold the commas
Times changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime
Wintertime
Dinnertime
Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive
Home

[Chorus]

Closer to my dreams 
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah 
I feel it in my sleep
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams---Lyrics submitted by ashley.

We had the type of nights where morning comes too soon
And nothing was the same

Watch me, going out of the way
When I should've went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live, and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, probably put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn something

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
Its supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' going on
Someone put a order in for a chicken
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen
Yeah they know I got the hook-up, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby I heat up the stove, you do the dishes ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different ya know?
Last album had it booming something vicious ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl ya know ya got that noila got that thing that I like
Girl you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn something

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Come thru, come thru, come thru, come thru
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come thru

Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been? Why has it been?

Who you been crying to? Who you been flying to?
Whose bed are you sleeping in? Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been?
You deserve rounds tonight, come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Rounds tonight oh, come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come thru girl you deserve rounds tonight---Lyrics submitted by Quiana Little.

I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks
Hit me when you done your shift
Wooh, I see you doin' well, baby
Oh, you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby
Is you single or what?
I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky
I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me
Someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that
Why you had to do him like that?
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh you at the club cashin' out with Eric
Then hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin' on some, "why-you-love-the-strippin-shit"
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit
All, on me
I don't deserve it
She's just a little too perfect
She's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog

Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer, hit me when you're done your shift
I need some company
I need some company
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime
Some company

Mo City trip! Mo City trip right now!
I'm on a Mo City trip, I'm on a Mo City trip right now
A Mo City trip right now
Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now

It's a couple faces in here that a nigga piped down
So let's go find a place that we can sip right now
Tour 'round the city, it's the shit right now
It's kinda lit right now that you're here right now
Pop a couple percs let's get it in right now
Saturday nights, off in my bed right now
Call up your girl and put them heels on
It's gettin' rowdy, rowdy right now
I'm on a Mo City trip
I'm a dog
I'ma dog, I'm in heat baby...heat baby
I'm a dog.....
I go ham, I'm a hog
Bitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'
By the way I broke her off
What she get in to, when we take it off
Drink so long, for a year I didn't cough
Fantasizin' and fistin' and switchin' up positions
Do you mind if we just menage just a little?

Mo City trip, Mo City trip right now---

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause

[Hook (8x)]
They loving the crew

[Verse 2: Drake]
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'mma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

[Hook (8x)]

[Outro]
Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
(If you broadcast swag, nigga, we the news in your city)
TRACK 4 ON TAKE CARE---Lyrics submitted by valeria.

When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world, that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)

We live in a generation of, not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)---Lyrics submitted by Gabi Ramsey.

[Drake]
You getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds preparing for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself you're the f-cking coldest
Intelligent too ooh you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together

Well aren't you a breath of fresh air
From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller think that they aint got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking somes d-cks until some millions appear
Voila! you do it right he might just buy you a car
Unless you play these suckers just like B.o.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying you declining I think thats kinda bizarre
Independant with the demeanor of an RnB singer
Make it rain finger (check)
M3 beamer (check)
Champagne range
Triple white Caddy
Closet full of brand new clothes and hand bags
Alexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louie and BeBe
Ya don't need it greedy or easy as these other breezy's
Who f-ck for bowls of baked ziti

Uh, 5 and a half in boys
Ass is off the hook
Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never
But never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever
You just lead the way
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I aint never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas
And enough money to loan us a little something extra
Should we ever need it
If it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it

This is why I do this shit.

I think they call this, uhm, venting.

Verse 1:

Look
Uhh.

This is me.
Still the same.
They want the hits.
I play the game.
No auto tune, but you can feel the pain.
It all comes spilling out like i hit a vein.
Watt up lil Braw.
Watt up slum Ville.
I hope you know that yall the reason i have fun still.
The fans thinking that we all signed for one meal.
Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.
That aint how it works.
That aint that how it goes.
And I been getting high to balance out the lows.
And I could use a writer to balance out my flows.
But I never share my thoughts,
This is all a nigga knows.
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes.
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised.
And I would be performing just as long as Im alive.
So every word I utter will be mine.

Chorus:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
Oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

Verse 2:
I never cried when Pac died.
But I probably will when Hov does.
And if my tears hold value, then i would drop one for every single thing he showed us.
And Ill be standing in a puddle.
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.
And ima keep it honest.
Am so tired of being subtle.
Its just me, Forty, O, and nich standing in a huddle.
Staring at the members of my team.
Who get questioned about they profit from this million dollar scheme.
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams.
I hope you tell your family this shit aint what it seems.
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion.
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless.
And know I pop bottles cuz i bottle my emotions.
At least I put it all in the open.

Chorus:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

Verse 3:
Look.
Fuck all yall.
We ignore feelin's here.
Premature millionaires.
Welcome to my realest year.
Yeah.
I swear we making a killah here.
I should be on top of the world here just chillen here.
Uh.
But its funny having fans.
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance, and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.
And realize when your there, sometimes the shit dont feel the same.
Yeah.
And plus things are just so real at home
People think Ive changed just because my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere so im never actually am alone, i just always feel alone.
I think im scared of what the future holds.
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.
Every girl I meet thinks im fucking groupie hoes.
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.
All my old friends think i got a new crowd.
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.
I guess that mean they come few and far between.
Even though am living out what you would call adream.
Yeah.
And my uncle aint even messaging me.
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.
I hope this isnt one of those forever things.
Its funny how money can change everything.

Chorus:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.

I’m more than just an option
Hey, Hey, Hey

[Chorus]
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and

Hey, Hey, Hey
I'll be the one that you remember
[Chorus]

I better find your love and

I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I better find your love and
I better find your heart
I bet if i give all my love then
nothing's gonna tear us apart 

I bet if i give all my love then
nothing's gonna tear us apart---Lyrics submitted by Aleira.

[1ST VERSE]

Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Lookin' down from the top and its crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant sh-t
When I hear talkin, I just dont know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams who Im racing with
You can see Im pacin it so that Im always chasin it
Wayne put me right here, thats who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
Octobers Own, but its lookin like July 4th
But I just wish theyd let you try it first
This time Im really goin off, fireworks

[Alicia Keys - Chorus]

When I go off like July 4th
feels like a fire, Got to go higher
Its your revelation, my sweet celebration
light me like a rocket, cause can't nothing stop it
all I see is fireworks,
all i see is fireworks
every night its fireworks
every night its fireworks
all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks
taking off like fireworks

[Verse 2]
I got this one girl, you know, in my life
so I say in this song, I say
I'm just such a gentleman
you should give it up for me
look at how I'm placing al my napkins and my cutlery
I can tell it wasn't love I just thought you f-ck with me
who coulda predicted love could strike now you stuck with me
yeh, I kept my wits about me luckilly
what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
and you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
but I was curious and I'll never forget it baby
what an experience
you coulda been the one but it wasnt that serious
their was smoke in the air before now its me cleaing it
that felt good, all and all I learned a lesson from it though
you never see it coming you just get to see it go
yeah I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
now I can see it in her eyes
Fireworks!

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3]
Everything the same but it feels different
my dad called me up knowing that I still listen
and he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my Realtor we built up a better rapport
got my mother in a place with some better decor
she searched the entire city I let her explore
ant now she's sayin' she's more lonely than every before
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic
searching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?
let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close
yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first, that's why I'm really going off, Fireworks!

[Chorus]---Lyrics submitted by arriana.

(Chorus)
It may not mean nothing to yall

swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo

everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness

you would think these niggas know me when they really doesnt
like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasnt

trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
remember she had a bad hip like a fanny pack
chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
all the way in Hollywood and i cant even act
they pull their cameras out and Goddamn they snap
I used to want this day forever yall can have it back

(Chorus)
it may not mean nothing to yall

wake up and smell the Garden

and i will never stop like Im running from the cops
hop up in my car and tow my chauffeur to the top
life is like a fucking roller coaster then it drops
but what should i scream for this is my theme park
my mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
pistol on my side you dont wanna hear that thing talk
let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne thats what they got to say or mention
Im like Nevada in the middle of the summer
Im resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
shhh, my foots sleeping on the gas
no brake pass no such thing as last

(Chorus)
It may not mean nothing to yall
but understand nothing was done for me
so I dont plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine
Im shutting shit down at the mall
and telling that girl she the one for me
and i aint even planning to call

[Eminem*]
There they go, back in stadiums
as Shady spits his flow
nuts they go, macadamia they go so ballistic woah
we can make them look like bosos
he's wondering if he should spit his slow
fuck no go for broke
his cup just runneth over oh no
he aint had a robust like this since the last time he overdosed
they've been waiting patiently for Pinnochio to poke his nose
back into the game and they know
rap will never be the same as before
bashing in the brains of these hoes
and establishing a name as he goes
the passion and the flame is ignited
you cant put it out once we light it
this shit is exactly what the fuck im talking about when we riot
you dealin with a few true villains
whose stayin inside of the booth truth spillin
and spit true feelings, till our tooth fillings come flying
up out of our mouths
now rewind it
payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
when I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass
so loud that it shakes the place
Im hannibal lecter so just in case your thinking of saving face
you aint gonna have no face to save by the time im through with this place

Whose stand inside of the booth truth spillinâ€™ 
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths 
Now rewind it! 
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me, so howâ€™s it taste? 
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place 
Iâ€™m Hannibal Lecter so just in case youâ€™re thinking of saving face 
You ainâ€™t gonna have no face to save by the time Iâ€™m through with this place 
So Drakeâ€¦ 

[Chorus] 
It may not mean nothing to yall 
But understand nothing was done for me 
So I donâ€™t plan on stopping at all 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man 
Iâ€™m shutting shit down at the mall 
And telling every girl she the one for me 
And I aint even planning to call 
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man, ever man

Chorus:
I got friends with money and i got money too

1st verse: 
Focus on women then you get less done

Im gettin rich caue i think being broke is less fun 
Celebratin fathers day everyday so dont get son

Here I go. Im a rapper turned singer. And you can tell that he smoke, but I don't need my vocal cords all I hit is C-Notes.
N.E.R.D flow, i spaz if im prevoked
I'm about to change the fuckin game, pass the re-mote.
Money is everythang, and its every other thing.
I'm part of the choir, its the motto that my brotha sang.
Cash is the right now, women are the post game.
Money-over-bitches dot com check the domain.
It's comin too soon, album on the way.
People ask me if I pray, I say yup, once in the blue moon.
Oops I mean a red moon... I did it again to 'em.
Let me leave a space in for your blood affiliation.
I say, heavy metaphors, flow so over weight.
I can rap around these other youngins like a cobra snake.
Frost bite drizzy nigga, no body as cold as Drake.
Keep yo ass in-line, don't be tryin to roller skate.
Fuck all the discreet shit, I get on some deep shit.
I am twenty-one tell me who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you can tell I'm real cause I'm getting hood lovin I ain't even talkin' street shit.
Young angel, young lyin and I'm done tryin.
I'm just doin, who's drinkin cause I'm buyin.
It's on meee, everything is on meee.
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin john B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listen back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet.
This is for all the stripper cause I know that they gonna bump it tellem back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it.
Ain't no pistols here, yo money will disappear.
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year.
Text brackets and back and forth faxes
My money comin full circle, get up on my axis.
Maybe Imma kill 'em, only cause I promised
They think I'm being cocky but I'm only being honest.
I'm swallowin the goose, got a model gettin loose, and I never party unless I got some bottles and a booth.
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this, I'm just having patience cause I want it to make sense.

White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit, drop a fo in it and appreciate the greatness. DRAKE!

Wayne: Yeah, p-p-pass the dro. I am such a beast and you ask them hoes. And they might even say you should leave me alone.
Homie scared. Cause they just like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy.
Just like Shaggy I toat dat boom bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck bout ya'll
I ain't talkin moths but you can pluck my balls
And yes I'm falling but up I fall and if ya bitch in heat she can fuck my dog.
I went from penny pinchin to private planes.
Never sat on any benches, I got in games.
Starter carter ball harder, ten girls penthouse suit ya'll order.
Whatever ya'll please. wine crackers and cheese.
They take off their clothes and put on my t's.
This supplement im on got me feeling mighty
My gun and money don't split call that shit Siamese.
My watch make the frickin' time freeze.
Yah girl bless me she suck my dick when I sneeze.
Cheap ass apartment, just the kitchen I need.
And eighteen G's is why the chicken cross the street.
Whatchya know about it my niggas so about it.
If we kill everybody they can't go to court about it.
Weezy I ignore the liars, baby I ignite the fire, I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer.
Got the shoty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me.
Im a bad boy obviously, pop one at your ivy league
I dont have a rivalry if so you will have a casualty, oops I meant a casualty, oops I meant catastrophy, oops I meant actually.
You niggas is just ass to me, and big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering.
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying, or I hang ya on the wall like an art gallery.
You got short salary, and I got long money, I got cash money, I got young money. bitch...

She says kiss you like miss me
Fuck me like you hate me
ANd when you're fuckinq someone else
just fuck her like she aint me

Damn those words are scary

I just tell her to spare me
I was in ---Lyrics submitted by Saima Russo.

[Verse 1:]
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdose on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence
Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long I'm floating in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gone make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it,(aye) please don't do it,(aye) cause one of us goes in
And we all go through it
Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

[Chorus:]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,

[Verse 2:]
Yeah, I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind.
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize it happened over time
She says they missed the old drake, girl don't tempt me
If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you suppose to do
I'm like why I gotta be all that but still I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listen to you expressing all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like all my children
And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions.
You know the game even got it like that.
You gone hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this it isn't just a hobby like that.
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know

[Chorus:]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave them a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know,

I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind (mind, mind, mind)
Tell em' I apologize it happened over time (time, time, time)
They know---Lyrics submitted by William AJ.

You used to call me on my, you used to, you used to
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages on your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if your rollin' backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing---

That's the shit I'm talking about though
Like you changed up
You don't even fucking link nobody no more
You just dash me away like a cyattie
Yo, you cheesed me dog

Always felt like my vision been bigger than the bigger picture
Crazy how you gotta wait until it’s dark out 
To see who really with you
Crazy how even when it miss ya
Shit’ll come back around and get ya
Crazy like all my niggas
Crazy like all my niggas
Remember I deleted all my other girls numbers out the phone for you?
Remember when you had to take the BAR exam
I drove in the snow for you
You probably don’t remember half the shit a nigga did for you

Ya, you ain’t really fuck with me way back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl
How bout now?
Girl how bout now?
How bout now girl?
What about now girl?
How bout now?

Always been daddy’s little angel
I bought your dad a bunch of shit for Christmas
He ain’t even say thank you
I had no money
Left from back when I was focused on the music
I used to always try and burn you CDs of my new shit
You be like “who’s this?”
I be like “me, girl.”
You be like “oh word, true shit?”
Then ask if we could listen to Ludacris
And car rides made me feel like I was losing it
Yeah, made me feel I have it like that
Like I was average like that
Started drinking way more than I used to
People form habits like that, girl
Yeah, man enough to tell you I was hurt that year
I’m not even Christian I still went to church that year
Guess, I just had to pretend that year
I ain’t even see my friends that year
Places that I should’ve been

You ain’t really fuck with me way back then
But how bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
Aw, you thought you had it all figured out back then girl
How bout now?
Cause I’m up right now and you suck right now
You thought the little effort that you put in was enough girl
How bout now?
Girl how bout now?
How bout now girl?
What about now girl?
How bout now?---

Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texting, I told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say

(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, alright

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple, keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew, bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial but we still met later that night
After my session, she came over, I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing and started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month and now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

(Gotta do what I gotta do, yeah)
All my exes live in Texas like I’m George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where-
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don’t even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ‘hello’ or ‘happy belated’
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that’s when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that’s when I text her and told her I love it
> Then right after text her and I told her I’m faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives can make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it’s fucked up, girl, I’m still fucking wit ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It’s women to call
There’s albums to drop, there’s liquor involved
There’s stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck about my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?

And I say
Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right

[Lil Wayne]
So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain’t no curfew
Bitch if you wave, then I will serve you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her a pill
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she’s texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon’ catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn’t married
Promises, I hope I never break ‘em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

[Bridge]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is wit’ you?

[Hook]
(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Damn right, all right

[Drake]
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin’ right
Fuckin’ right, all right

Rock me real slowly
Put a bib on me
I'm just like a baby, drooling over you
The things you do

These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me
Listen, you can hear them calling my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soul mate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' bout us you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you

She said you're my everything
I love you through everything
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle, she from the jungle
I take somebody else's car, drive there undercover
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you 'bout everything
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
If I need to talk are you around?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?
Are you down for the cause?
You still down? You still down? You still down?

These days these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switching majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we've done?
Who is your replacement?
Are we still good? Are we still good?
Are we still good? Are we still good?---

[Verse 1:]
Things been so crazy and hected
I should of have got back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better any how...

[Bridge:]
So if you gotta go
If there's anythin I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you looking for a purpose

[Verse 2:]
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm all singing karaoke, further than I ever been

[Bridge:]
So if you gotta go...
If there's anyway I can help

[Verse 3: Rap]
Isn't it ironic,
That the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner
And tell's me my life is to much and moves to atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you would choose some where that had somebody that you know
I'm alway's up to late
I worry bout you there alone in a place you call your home warm nights and cold patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy cause no man wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest but the first cut is the deepest
I tryed to keep us together you was busy keeping secrets
Secrets you would tell everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money
I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm suprise you couldn't tell

[Bridge:]
I was only trying to get ahead [x2]
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And your looking for a purpose


I was only trying to get ahead [x2]
But the spotlight makes you nervous...---Lyrics submitted by kari.

Hol it, Hol it, Hol it, Hol it, Hol it
Y'all sleepin' in the streets
Shaky warrior
Yeah, this that Oliver 40, Niko shit man, 15 Fort York shit ya know
Boi-1da, what's poppin'?

Yeah, yeah
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari then I swerve
I want that Bugatti just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me I guess I know myself
Shakiness man I don't have no time for that
My city too turnt up I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbraud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
That's when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man I'm talkin' way before hashtags

I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Yeah! I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go
You know how that shit go

Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up in here got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie
Yeah, and you know how that shit go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah but you know how that shit go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go

She know it, it a no big
Always haffi look out an ya know if yuh head buk out
Dun know, a de unruly boss, dis man
No bomboclat, otha
And if a boy nuh like
OVO crew my nigga can just suck ya motha
With no apology, If you nuh like we, we nuh like you neither youth
Your girl a say we cute, if you diss you will get execute
That's the truth, OVO unruly

(machine gun shots)

With my woes---

I don't know why they been lying but yo shit is not that inspiring
Bank account statements just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talkin' that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one that you should worry about
I don't know who you're referring to, who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplaying the money but that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time putting money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour and you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the making, it's all for the city
You know I come right every summer, Cash Money Records forever
I'm always big timing, bitch, I came up right under Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"

I'm about to roll one and light it and fuck it man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you whylin', I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands and eat with Italians, I do
People are funny; you don't even know about the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed, it could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me, just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"
Okay, now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Now you're talking my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck, I said "Girl, that's all that we do"

You understand me?
Showtime, headlines
Big time, sunshine, tote nines
Bust mines, flatline, hard grind
High life, stay fly as jet time
Stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga
Every time you see a nigga
Stunt nigga
Swag on head to feet nigga
Stunt nigga
I might just bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city and that's word to Stunna
You know it---Lyrics submitted by tiana mitchell.

When I pull up on a nigga tell that nigga back back
I'm too good with these words, watch a nigga backtrack
If I die all I know is I'm a mothafuckin' legend
It's too late for my city, I'm the youngest nigga reppin

Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend
Oh my God, oh my God
If I die, I'm a legend

I'm up first, I'm on tour, got a girl, she from the South
Used to work, used to dance in Texas, now she clean the house
Everyday, I was strugglin' to learn what life's about
On my way
Money taught me Spanish, make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They 'on't know who we are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star
Right or wrong, I'mma write my wrongs
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong

I'm the one, one
Why do I feel like the only one?
Why do I feel like you owe me one?
6 G-O-D, I'm the holy one
Yeaaah, you know wassup
They been off for a minute now
You know they all sentimental now
You know they all actin' different now
And I, I just can't pretend
Seen too much, it's so hard for me to let new people in
I can't change, this shit set in stone
They can't live this long
You don't know where you're gonna go
I got this shit mapped out strong---

[Verse 1: Drake]
I've been up for 4 days
Getting money both ways
Dirty and clean, I could use a glass of cold Spades
Rolexes, chauffeurs and low fades
I keep thinking how young you can die from old age
They always tell me nobody's working as hard as you
And even though I laugh it off, man, it's probably true
Cuz while all of my closest friends out partying
I'm just here making all the music that they party to
But party on, party on, all night nigga
I got these new rappers nervous prom night nigga
I've grown tired of these fucking grown man liars
Storytellers, they ain't even need a campfire
Uhh, but I just wanna tell the truth
Before one of these haters load a couple shells and shoot
This shit feel like when Fredro Starr was at Sunset Park
Stuntin' hard in his yellow Goose
Yeah, but I'm a ma'fuckin' missed target
But a target nonetheless and I just started
Was that directed at moi? It can't be
They must be talking to themselves, hoes hands free
Yeah, and I'm just filling up this daily planner
Gettin' busy 'cause I'm a star, no spangled banner
Jealous dudes get to talkin' in they music
And I just say I wrote it for your girlfriends, Kelsey Grammar
Yeah, that's what life becomes when you're doing you
Welcome to Hollywood, don't let this town ruin you,
And if you pillow talking with the women that are screwin' you
Just know that she gon' tell another nigga when she through wit you
Don't get impatient when it takes too long
Drink it all even when it tastes too strong
Yeah, I gotta feel alive, even if it kills me
I promise to always give you me, the real me

[Chorus: Drake]
Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
(Hey, Guru, tell hom' to go to open that Ace right there),
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Even when the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Owww, hoes turn they heads like, owls
I'm the man of the hour
Triple entendre, don't even ask me how
Con Edison flow, I'm connected to a higher power
Bright life'd make your whole city light up
A trillion-watt light bulb, when I'm in the nightclub
I just landed in that G450
Caught the Mayweather fight, 'cause the satellite was crispy
(Uh) Y'all can miss me with that money talk
The smart money's on Hov, fuck what the dummies talk
I don't do too much blogging
I just run the town, I don't do too much jogging
(Unh) I ain't got a scar yet
'Cause you fuckin' around with me and my dogs is far-fetched
Drake, here is how they gon' come at you
Will silly raps for you tryin' to distract you
In disguise, in the form of a favor
The Barzini me, watch for the traitors
(Unh) I done seen it all, done it all
That's why none of these dumb-dumbs could dun him off
The summer's ours, the winter too
Top down in the winter, that's what winners do
And to these niggas I'm like Windows 7
You let 'em tell it, they swear that they invented you
And since no good deed go unpunished
I'm not as cool with niggas as I once was
I once was, cool as The Fonz was
But these bright lights turned me to a monster
Sorry, mama, I promised it wouldn't change me
But I would've went insane had I remained the same me
Fuck niggas, bitches too
All I got is this money, this'll do

[Chorus: Drake]
Who would have thought
I'd be caught in this life?
Let's celebrate with a toast
And get lost in tonight
And make it all light up
Wait until the sun goes down
We gon' make this bitch light up
Wait until the sun goes down
I'm gon' make this go---Lyrics submitted by Luis.

Breathe through, ride through
Damn, girl, oh man, I don't know
Pilled up, filled up
Damn, girl, I'll be gettin' back to you for sure
Laced up, dripped up, sauced up
Damn, girl, I wanna ride with you
Waved up, goin' up, glowin' up, growin' up
Had to get it poppin' with you

What if I pick you up from your house?
We should get out, we haven't talked in a while
We should roll to see where it goes
I saw potential in you from the go, you know that I did
I don't know if you know, but I know who you are
You could be big as Madonna
Just get in the car and then let's touch the road
Don't make other plans
Say you get up early, you work for the man
Well, he'll understand
Pull up, I'm pullin' up on you in ten
Already on ten
Big as Madonna, I'll say it again
Soon as you get in---

Hello
Yeah I just walked in
Yeah I'm good you still working?
Tonight, right now?
'Did I go out' yeah I went out
I went, I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed
Shit... wine or water
You said something about a cold drink
I don't know, I'm delirious... night

[Drake - Verse 1]
Cups of the Rose
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy

But I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say
"F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had"
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doing thats so important?
I've been drinking so much
That I'ma call you anyway and say

F-ck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say "f-ck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around"

(Are you drunk right now?)

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin talkin' 'bout bitches
That we almost had
I don't think I'm concious of making monsters
Outta the women that I sponsor til it all goes bad
But shit it's all good
We threw a party, yeh we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeh, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women thats living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite in that mixture, I've been talking crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on

[Drake and Woman on phone]
Well I'm sorry" -- Drake
Are you drunk right now? -- Woman

I'm just sayin', you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin', only if you make me

[Drake on phone]
You're not going to come?
Guess i'm bout to just kick it here then...

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said "you niggas crazy"
I hope no-one heard that
I hope no-one heard that
Cause if they did, we gon be in some trouble---Lyrics submitted by Austin.

I am on a 24 hour champagne diet

I Encourage you to try it 
Im probably just saying that cause i dont have to buy it 
The club owner supply it 
Boy im on that fly shit 
I am what everybody in my past dont want me to be 
Guess what i made it 
Im the muthaf-cking man 
I just want you to see,come take a look 
Get a load of this n-gga 
Quit frontin on me 
Dont come around and try come gas me up 
I like runnin on E 
I, I, I, 
Im on my Disney shit goofy flow 
On records im captain hook and my new car is roofio 
Damn 
Where my roof just go 
Im somebody that you should know 
Get to shakin somethin cus thats what Drumma produced it for 
Yes i make mistakes that i dont ever make excuses for 
Like leavin' girls that love me and Constantly seducing hoes 
Im losing my thoughts i say damn 
Where my roof just go? 
Top slipped off like Janet at the super bowl, 
I got em 

[Chorus] 
they cant help it, and I cant blame em 
Since I got famous but b-tch, I got money to blow 
Im gettin it in, letting these bills fall 
All over your skin 
Got money to blow oh oh oh oh 

[Birdman] 
Richer than the richest 
We certified gettin it CM YM Cash Money business 
Higher than the ceiling fly like a bird, hit the gucci store 
And later get served 
We smoked out with no roof on it 
Them people passin so we smash on them 
Ballin out we keep the cash on deck 
Lamborghini and the Bentleys on the V-set 
Louie lens iced out with the black diamonds 
Car of the year Ferrari the new Spider 
No lie im higher than i ever been 
Born rich born uptown born to win 
Fully loaded automatic 6 Benz 
Candy paint foreign lights with my b-tch in 
Born hustlin too big n-gga to strive me up 
Cant stop me more money burn em up 

[Chorus] 

[Weezy] 
When I get paid every 24 hours money and the power 
Come to VIP and get a Champagne Shower 
I dont have to worry because everything ours, 
and I got a big bouquet of Mary Janes Flowers 
That kush I promise Thats My Dude 
But we dont smoke that Reggie Bush 
And Im with two women make you take a second look 
We poppin like Champagne Bottles But We Never Shook 
and We Goin Be Alright If We Put Drake On Every Hook

[Verse 1]
I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fuckin women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25 sittin on 25 mil
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

[Hook]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't seem 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt?
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money got a drum on the gun
Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

[Chorus]

I had to take her ass to Paris
give her the moments that she cherish

[Lil Wayne]

and anything she want I +wheel+ like +ferris+

I mean I hope its one of them long nights
no wrong turns, aint no such things as a wrong right

[Drake]

no adjusting for you, you know just what to do and all

I think the glass slipper does fit

[Lil Wayne]
and yesterday I told her she a muthafucker
and how her new haircut is so becoming of her

[Chorus]

[Drake]

I really love to be the one you took a step with
so trust me when I tell you it'd be worth the effort

[Lil Wayne]
shes unbelievable like a purple leopard (?)
just give me the formula watch me work the method
hehe, Weezy F, I prefer the best shit

and when she turn around they say Whoa like Joey
thats my baby
and I love it
yeah, Young Money---Lyrics submitted by Precious.

Envelopes comin' in the mail, let her open 'em
Hopin' for a check again, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, she invite me to the telly, keep the blade with me
When I go to check a bitch, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, police comin' 'round lookin' for some help
On a case they gotta solve, we never help 'em
Yeah, I stay up late at night, thinkin' 'bout my life
Want a lot, will I get it all? Ain't no tellin'
Ain't no tellin', yeah, ain't no tellin'
Yeah, no tellin', ain't no tellin'

Suitcase, I been livin' out a suitcase
Still drinkin' Henny, if it's done, I'll take the D'usse
Oops, aye, fuck it, all you niggas two-faced
Got the club goin' up on a Tuesday
True say, I been goin' hard, but then again
They think I'm soft, think I'm innocent
I'm just lookin' in the mirror like I'm really him
Man, I'm really him, you just fillin' in, man
I got a blunt, can I get a light?
Yeah, I took the summer off to get it right
Yeah, I gave these boys a shot and they fuckin' failed
Niggas like "you took the summer off? we couldn't tell"
Dawg, just bought a island, gotta sail to it
You pick the casket, I'll put the nail through it
I ain't gotta do it, but fuck it somebody gotta do it
Hate if someone else did it, fuck, I may as well do it

Okay, I had to switch the flow up on you niggas
The shit was gettin' too predictable
The new shit is on steroids, I would never pass a physical
I got it rollin' in all kinda ways, lump sum and residual, yeah
I mean we hear about the money you been gettin'
We just never seen a visual
It's our year (aw yeah), Aw yeah
I mean besides Ricky Ross, Aubrey the biggest boss here (grunt)
What's the word these days?
Buncha' niggas chasing after all these woman they don't even know (WOOO)
Buncha' out of season woman
Fuckin' off-season niggas to get last season wardrobe (WOOO)
All the rappers that you vouch for
Need to get out of the house more, they washed up
And even if the team was religious with it
I can't really see another squad tryna' cross us, naw (WOOO)

OVO, Unruly
One shot to make it in a life
From the six to the fucking 876

I gotta keep watchin' for oppers 'case anything's possible, yeah
There's no code or ethics out here, anyone will take shots at you, yeah
Niggas think they can come take what I got, let's be logical, yeah
V-Live, I order that Alfredo pasta then eat in the kitchen like i'm in the mafia
Houston, they get me though
European, my vehicle
How much it hit me fo'?
Ain't no tellin', yeah
What am I willin' to give her to get what I want tonight?
Ain't no tellin'
Please don't speak to me like I'm that Drake from four years ago

Thinkin' they lions and tigers and bears, I go huntin'
Put heads on my fire place, oh my
Take time, ain't no tellin'
Oh my, ain't no tellin'---

[Sample: Notorious B.I.G]
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya
See ya picture, now they wanna grab the guns and come and get ya

[Intro]
Yeah, one time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch

[Verse 1]
I'm so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need

[Verse 2]
I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Air Force stunting flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's
Don't know why it happens, everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear I'm in my zone
So I'm a sip this drank until that muthafucka gone
And you gon' get undressed and we gon' get it on

[Hook]
I don't give you the time, you deserve from me
This is something I know, I know, I know
So tonight I'll just fuck you like we're in Houston
Takin' everything slow, so slow, so slow but I do it to her

[Bridge]
Drapped up, dripped out, know what I'm talking 'bout
3 in the morning, get it popping in the parking lot
It's on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G 'til the end

[Outro]
Ay, yeah, I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation
You know, I just get that feeling like I'm in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
It's about like 11 p.m. and you just rollin' through the city
Bumpin' that Screw, Big Moe, UGK, Lil' Keke
It feel like everything just moving slow
Let's take my time, I pace it baby, yeah, I'm gone---Lyrics submitted by Devon Morrisey.

It's over, yeah it's over yeah, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I can't stay here no more and I can't sleep on the floor
Man, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah I'm leaving, yeah I'm leaving, yeah I'm leaving, I'm gone
I'm leaving, I'm gone
I had to knock down the wall
Yeah I swear to god that I'm gone
I'm leaving, I'm leaving
No looking back when I'm gone
No looking back when I'm gone
No more (x16)

It's over, yeah it over, yeah I'm leaving, I'm gone
I've been doing this wrong, I've been here for too long
Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, you know I got my reasons
Yeah I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm gone
I don't wanna miss the boat, I don't wanna sit in coach
I don't wanna sit at home, I gotta get where I'm going
I'm afraid I'mma die before I get where I'm going
I know I'mma be alone
I know I'm out on my own
I just gotta hit the road
I just gotta know the road
I just gotta hit a road
I just gotta know the road
I just gotta know the road

Something is said, don't say that again
I just been out and bad from way back when
I can't be out here on no laid back shit
I can't be out here on no laid back shit
You got something to say, then say that thing
I just been out and bad from way back when
I gotta get on the road, I gotta get on the road
I ain't looking back no more, no, no, no
No more (x14)

I gotta go out and get, want you to know what I did
Want you to know how it went
That's why I keep telling you over and over again
Just let me go
Just let me go, let me bring it home to you
Just let me go, let me bring it home to you
Now and forever, I'll bring it home to you
Just let me go, let me bring it home
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
Let me go, let me bring it home
Now and forever, I'll bring it home to you
Let me go, let me bring it home to you
Let me go, let bring bring it home to you
Now and forever, I'll bring it home
Now and forever, I'll bring it home---

[Drake - Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now that I didn’t know last year
who the fuck are y’all
I swear it feels like the last few nights we’ve been everywhere and back
but I just can’t remember it all
what am I doing, what am I doing
oh yeah that's right, I’m doing me, I’m doing me
I’m living life right now man
and this what I’m do til its over
til it’s over, it’s far from over

[Verse 1]
alright, bottles on me
long as I’m a drink it
never drop the ball, fuck y’all thinking
making sure the young money ship is never sinking
bout to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett
I shouldn’t have drove, tell me how I’m getting home
you too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language Rosetta stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I’ve ever known
got to go thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
all I need is a fucking red jackets with some zippers
super good smiddoke a package of the swishas
I did it over night, it couldn’t happen any quicker
y’all know them, but fuck it me either
but point the biggest skeptic out I’ll make them a believer
it wouldn’t be the first time I’ve done it throwing hundreds
when I should be throwing ones bitch I run it ahh,

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Uhhh,
one thing 'bout music when it hits you feel no pain
and I swear I got this shit that makes these bitches go insane
so they tell me that they love me I know better than that it’s just game
it’s just what comes with the flame
and I’m ready for that I’m just saying
but I really can’t complain, everything is kosher
two thumbs up, ebert and roeper
I really can’t see the end getting any closer
but I’ll probably still be the man when everything is over
so I’m riding through the city with my high beams on
can you see me can you see me get your visine on
y’all just do not fit the picture
turn your widespread on
if you thinking Imma quit before I die dream on
man they treat me like a legend
am I really this cold
I’m really too young to be felling this old
it’s about time you admit it who you kidding man
nobody’s ever done it like I did it
ahh
(chorus)---Lyrics submitted by CRiSPy.

How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself "why do you hurt me?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know that you love me baby
Time to take you away from me...
Only over my dead body...

[Drake-Verse 1]
I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
Mmm, mmm
F*ck it I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Now-a-days it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some 
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from

Yeah, you know me well nigga, yeah 
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the p-ssy but I'm just playing the field nigga, yea
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again 
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earing in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine 
And I be hearing sh*t you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time, yea
It's been that way from the beginning I just been playing, I aint even notice that I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

[Hook]
I know, I know that you love me baby
The time to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Drake - Verse 2]
You say I'm old news, where who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anyway, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the states
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing deadtime
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And f-ck you to the niggas that thinks it's there time, yea
Don't make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever gave you a star boy
Or you wanna be a mother fuckin' funny guy
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart boy
Yea, it's whatever
You know, feeling good, living better
I think I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel now more than ever
My city love me like I'm Mac Dre in The Bay
Second Album I'm pack paving away
The backpackers are back on the band wagon like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby's mom last night
We took a picture Last night
I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And lost everything that I came with
Yea, feel like I've been here before
I still got 10 years to go, ha
And this is the only sound you should fear
And these kids where crowns over here & everything is alright...

Young nigga preach
Preach, preach, preach, preach, preach, preach

I'm in Miami
I need to call up Miss Cassidy
My name is party, not participation
Sorry for the miscommunication
I need a drink and some tequila with you
You know what I'm trying to do
Hey, let's pop the E off at Liv
I've got some time here to blow
I've got the money to blow
I've got the money and blow
Don't have to guess how I know
Oh, it's a secret just for me, I'll keep it
You old niggas boring as bones
You put the PARTY tape on
You know what's going on
You know what's going on
She keep it wet like tsunami
She think she sunk the Titanic
I get her hot like Wasabi
She think it's wavy and gnarly
I think I'mma pop one for you
Drink one for you

Still in Miami
Most of these girls are too messy
I've got to do some reflecting
I've got to find me one out here that is good at taking direction
I am convinced that my calls are being recorded
So hit my assistant to get me the message
And make the connection like brrrrr
I'm on that wave tonight, I hope you not the crazy type
I'm in your state tonight, I might just break the bank tonight
PND ain't with the ray tay, you know Jay Wray
Got girls here going way way way way way way
Sauga city trip the pay day
Glo'd up off a gate way, man, you can't afford me
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story
Niggas is all in their feelings these days
All in their feelings these days
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes
You should be afraid

I'm preaching, oooh
Preaching
Preaching, babe
Preaching, whooo
I'm a finally, finally
Yeah---

Ay yo DJ respect let’s get em
Veterans like how dare all of this arrogance
What you expect when all they do draw comparisons between us and Americans
And tell me go hard well I am going harder now 
Bumping Shawn Carter cause there aint a Shawn Carter now feel me
Get with it I’m trying to overthrow a nation using Phade To Black as a niggas only motivation
I’m picking and choosing an army and thinking of moving my talent disprove it
Let’s show her heads who’s in
And if you must know this year I’m going for the gusto plus though seat feeling like a bus load
So take me as I am I have nada of me the red stripe on my jacket show you that parade love me
I’m a threat in a city of no legends imagine that a whole Sistine with no brethrens
No blood glide gunshots identity this you a rapper homie leave that for trinity Chris word
See my role models role with models and switch gold bottles holding more dough then the whole lotto
 So while you clowns making toasts in a cheap bar the whole ATF make mamoses with the clique quad
What up Nikko Jordan Lucky and TJ nicknamed the night fox clique we take it easy
You prime ministers claim you repping the team I need a mother fucking president to represent me---Lyrics submitted by Aubrey.

You're my right hand, you're my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will

But I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip Benz wheel
And I know you can't wait
You dream big and sleep late
You got a lot on your plate
That's why you're always working out
Taking pictures of yourself
You don't see anybody else
You're like oh well
You're like fuck it oh well
My past behind me like a pony tail

But you're my right hand, you're my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will

Ok I know you want the Audi
I know you want to go to Maui
You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
Cause you don't trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things he can't afford for ya
Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you
Like the car with the strap in it
Thank God that's finished
Cause now it's back to business
Any more henny and you're past the limit
You told me about the picture
Now you have to send it
I would never put you on blast when I get it

You're my right hand, you're my go to
Told me everything about you
That's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will---

[Drake] (Chorus)
This sh-t was all I knew,
you and me only,
and I did it all for you,
still you were lonely,
we coulda worked it out,

uhh, but i guess things change,
its funny how someone elses success brings pain,
when ya no longer involved that person has it all,
and you just stuck standing there,

But, Im gonna need you to say something baby,
say something baby,
say something baby,
Im gonna need you to say something baby,
say something baby,
say something baby,

[Timbaland]
Yeah,
ever since Ive been long gone,
I traded in my senorita for a microphone,
I hate the way you fell apart girl, its sad to see,
your life is good but me and you its catastrophe,
if I was unsuccessful would you be satisfied,
I need a paramedic girl, Im feeling paralysed,
if I could choose, you will always be a friend to me,
the more money I made you acting like my enemy,
its crazy, I cant help it if you feel ashamed,
lots of pressure will turn you into my diamond babe,
how can something so familiar be so strange,
closest friends get estranged when the status change,
ahh, is it my mistake, think that where I am and where you at,
and my whole wild is the only one that had my back,
you were the perfect girl, now it seems we dont match,
is it the money, want me to give it back,

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Uhh, i am the topic of conversation, this a celebration,
lets toast to the fact that I moved out my momma basement,
to a condo downtown because its all about location,
I sit and drink wine and watch californication of life,
you shoulda been here to kick it with me,
we coulda split this whole thing up 50/50,
but now im at the 40/40 getting b-tches tipsy,
killing sh-t the ever so talented Mr Ripley,
how I go from being the man that you argue with,
to me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest sh-t,
I should wanna go back to the one I started with,
but Im addicted to this life its gonna be hard to quit,
yeah, just ask me how things are coming along,
you can tell me that you never heard none of my songs,
long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen,
cos whats a star when its most important fan is missing?

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Cynthia.

Why do I feel so alone? 
Like everybody passing through the studio ,
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role ,
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know,
And I don't have the heart to give these, 
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go, 
So they stick around kicking out feedback, 
And I entertain it as if I need that, 
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that,
My privacy about the only thing I need back but, 
It's hard to think of them polite flows, 
Mr. Fano Poloto suits are your night clothes, 
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes, 
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed, 
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows, 
Life was so full, 
Now this shit just being lipo'd, 
Always said I'd say it all on the right track, 
But in this game you only lose when you fight back, 
Black diamond bracelets, 
Showing you the basics, 
I can't live and hold the camera, 
Someone gotta tape this, 
I make hits unlike a bitch, 
That's married I ain't miss, 
24 hours from greatness, 
I'm that close, 
Don't ever forget the moment, 
You began to doubt, 
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out, 
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South, 
Watchin' whole show, 
Embarrassed to pull my camera out, 
And my mother embarrassed, 
To pull my Phantom out, 
So I park about 5 houses down, 
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown, 
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around, 
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus, 
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness, 
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus, 
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless, 
And promoters try to get me out to they club, 
They say I have fun but I can't imagine how, 
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, 
Standing with my next girl, 
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now, 
And shit could get weird unless they all down, 
And so I stay clear.

We from a small town, 
Everybody talks and everybody listen, 
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing, 
I've always been something that these labels can't buy, 
Especially if they tryin' to take a peice of my sou,l 
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez "Damn Drake fly" 
And he just be like "Silly mother fucker I know" 
That was your bad, 
How could you pass up on 'em? 
He just take them records, 
And he gas up on 'em, 
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em, 
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em, 
Oh they did Po, 
At least they tried to, 
And that's what happens, 
When you spitting what's inside you, 
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video, 
And they think they can market you, 
However they decide to nahh, 
But Forty told me to do me, 
And don't listen to anybody that knew me, 
'Cause to have known me would, 
Mean that there's a new me, 
And if you think I changed in the slightest, 
Could of fooled me, 
Boy in my city I'm da 2-3, 
Drug dealers live vicariously through me, 
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy, 
I'm just not the social type, 

And campus life is crazy understand, 
I could get money with my eyes closed, 
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo, 
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll, 
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know, 
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will, 
I got new shit, 

I'm gettin' better still, 
Little niggas put my name in they verses, 
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal, 
Future said 'cause this 'Ye shit you better kill, 
And I think this got this "Making of a Legend" feel, 
Problem with these other niggas they, 
Ain't never real, 
Yea ... that's all I can say.---Lyrics submitted by Raevin.

Drake]
I can see it in your eyes, you're angry
Regret got sh*t on what you're feeling now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take, all the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it, Alicia, Katia
I know that you gon' hear this, I'm the man
Yeah I said it, B*tch I'm the man
Don't you forget it

The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in the speaker right now: that's me
And the voice in the mirror, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are, then I made it
And you're wasted, with your ladies
Yeah I'm the reason that you always getting faded

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

A shot for me...A shot for me

Ok look, I'm honest
Girl I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things

It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of "Mr Perfect"
I could tell that you been crying all night, drinking all summer
Praying for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

Oh oh oh

Take a shot for me...

A shot for me...A shot for me

Trouble neglect you, angels protect you

[Verse 1]
I live for the nights that I can’t remember,
with the people that I won’t forget
spending all the money I just work my ass off
for the things that I won’t regret
I’ve been waiting way too long long long long
tellin’ everybody that I know we about to be on on on on
I ain’t tryin’ look like I lie to these niggas that I came up with
that’s my team, never would I let a woman come between
what we doing right now
this our dream, Wu Tang Clan niggas want that cream
I’m the Osirus of the shit right now
go to guy for the hits right now
whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now
if you can’t hold your liquor you better quit right now

[Chorus]
[Hook]

[Drake - Verse 2]
How ’bout you and all your morals in that outfit that you borrowed
make the most out of tonight and worry bout it all tomorrow
understand girl, we fam girl
can’t get me right and I do Wayne
Cash money young money pop champagne
Presidential suite girl Barrack Hussain
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg
people really hate when a backpack rapper get rich
and start livin’ that life dawg
feels like when you gettin’ to that paper hip hop hates ya
they would do it just like I do if they could
its in our nature
ahh, young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of that killer
I came up in the underground though
so I’ma spend another ten thousand for Dilla
call me over rated or creative or too jaded
because any way you put it bitch I made it, YUP

[Chorus]
[Hook]---Lyrics submitted by mANUEL.

These girls aint got nothing on you

trying to take you out girl, hope your not too busy
and if theres nothing wrong, got this little song
for you to get ready to

put that f-cking dress on and work it kind of vicious
like somebodys taking pictures

That's what they doin', Cameron, they actin' like these singers, man.
I ain't goin' to the studio until I got a situation.
A subject, I need a beat, I need the producer.
Who gonna be on the hook?
Man, what is you doin'?
Go in the studio with fuckin' clips, clips, ammo!

Brand new Beretta, can't wait to let it go
Walk up in my label like, where the check though?
Yeah, I said it, wouldn't dap you with the left ho
Shut the fuck up, text from a centerfold, I ain't reply
Let her know I read it though
Voice mail say she ready though
Niggas know I'm credible, ain't no pussy on a pedestal
Got my foot on the 'cedes Benz pedal
Doin' 90 on the bridge like, "nigga you already know"
And if you don't know, then now you know, now you know
Switchin' up the angles
Now I'm in the Rolls with illuminated angel
Four or five chains made of gold gettin' tangled
My nigga Biz said, "the first mill gon' change you"
Change for the better, hit it then dead her
That's my vendetta, keep this shit together
Goddamn, we ain't even gotta scam
Cocaine coupe, we ain't even got a scale
Used to flip apps, now that old plug murked
Ain't a damn thing changed, you can still get the work

Just hold on one moment and someone will be right with you
(We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service)

Yeah, I remember how I went to Louis V with Haf'
Watched them spread ten thousand dollars on the glass
I never ever thought I'd see that in my life
Now I'm in the East cause my boys are gettin' right, man
I was on TV makin' fifty racks a year
After helpin' mama out the shit would disappear
I am not a man, I can't do this on my own
So I started askin' them if they would put me on
And they did put me on, yeah, they did put me on
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phone, line
Line blowin' up, workin' on the phones
Now we in the basement and we workin' on the phones
But I just couldn't do it, had to leave that shit alone, man

Hear What?
Yo hear what, tek time
(Laughing)
Ahh, no shit!
Yo hear what?
Wa gwan ...
Yo him fried, him fried and a sleep awhile ago inna di van you know Drizzy

Blowin' up, line blowin' up, they need the whole thing
Blowin' up, my niggas really need the whole thing

I do better with the rider in my system
Oh yeah, I'm on deck, when you call me I'll listen
I listen unless I been mixin', you know when I'm mixin'
You know when I'm mixin', I smoke when I drink, it's tradition
Like Zoe mama I go hippy
Peace sign in the air like I'm Nixon
I'm mixin', I am not Esco, but it was written
I knew when they didn't, I been had these visions
Of the life I'm livin' since I was Jimmy
All I had to do was just go and get it, and now we---

Started....Zombie on the track....

[Chorus]
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here

[Verse 1]
I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my mama's house we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was trying to get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back"
Nigga, I just think its funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show
And we...

[Chorus]
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here

[Verse 2]
Boys tell stories about the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it, nigga
I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much I hear that's poppin' off without us, nigga
We just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry about me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house
Cause we...

[Chorus]
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here

[Bridge]
No new niggas, nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stays the same I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stay the same through the money and the fame
Cause we...

They be staring at the money like it's unfamiliar,
I get it,
I live it,
To me there's nothings realer,
Just enough to solve your problems,
Too much would kill ya,
And when I leave,
I always come right back here,
The young spit it and everybody in rap fear,
A lot of ya'll still sounding like last year,
The game needs change and I'm the motherfucking cashier,
Nickels for my thoughts,
Dimes in my bed,
Quarters of the kush,
Ain't the limes in my head,
Take my verses too serious ya hate me,
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD,
Yeah,
I want it all,
That's why I strive for it,
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it,
Any awards show or party I'll get fly for it,
I know what's coming I just hope I'm alive for it.

[Drake:]
Yeah,
I want things to go my way,
But as of late a lot of shit been going sideways,
And my mother tried to runaway from home,
But I left somethin in the car so I caught her in the driveway,
And she cried to me so I cried too,
And my stomach was soaking wet,
She only 5'2,
And 48 hours all before I showed up,
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up,
Damn my reality just set in,
And even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in,
I do a lot of things,
Hoping I never have to fit in,
So trying to keep up with my programs is like a dead end,
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow,
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show,
And life change for us every single week,
So what's good,
But I know this ain't the peak though
Cause I want...

[Trey Songz:]
I want the money,

[Drake:]
Wise words from a decent man,
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand,
This lost boy got fly without peter pan,
And my delivery just got me buzzing like the pizza man,
In person I am everything and more,
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before,
But inside I'm treading waters steady trying to swim ashore,
I'm on a shoppin spree to get whatever is in store,
Just call me shop and bag drizzy,
And call me Mr.damn he ain't coping that is he?
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy,
While this youngin that you doubting is about to get busy,
I'm a kill it I promise this I know you mad,
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads,
To big homie use a flash if you must,
And I swear I ain't asking for much
All I want is

[Trey Songz:]
I want the money,
Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes,
The hoes,
I suppose,
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.
I just wanna be,

Successful.
I just wanna be,
I just wanna be,
Successful.

It's like I know what I got to say,
I just don't know how to say it to you

[Lil Wayne:]
Pardon the swag,
But bitches cartate,
Long bread I don't eat shortcake,
How come I can't,
Miss a woman like I can't miss cartdates,
Cheese,
But shes not in this portrait,
Life's fine but I don not portray,
I'm on the other side but it is a short gate,
I don't want the glow,
I want the glow ray,
And I'm a fuck the world,
But this is just foreplay,
Tired of hearing bullshit,
Bring her on to cowshit,
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier than ? shit,
That's word to toronto,
So high up I got birds in the condo,
Ain't that a female dog,
Ask her who I am to her,
And she yell god,
Weezy baby go ? hard,
No further details boy.---Lyrics submitted by Darold.

Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All in the same thing
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kai's kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
I’m just a sicko a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest I expect you to aim for the head?
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try to say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit ‘em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those the strings that you can’t pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source
Fuck with all the word of mouth
Golden State running practice at my house
Nigga, what am I about?
You gon’ really feel it now
I’m out here…

Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen
All summer sixteen
Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons

Looking for revenge

All you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little
All your exes know I like my O’s with a V in the middle
You would love it if I went away or didn’t say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake
Say you seeing ‘bout it when you see me man y’all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn’t say
We even gave you the whole money play and y'all still broke to this day
“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, Now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine's just big is what I’m saying
I’m that nigga’s what I’m saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here
I’m not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six soon as I’m back in the city they throw a parade
I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne
Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave
Yeah, so trust me, they’ll be out here…

Looking for revenge
All summer sixteen

(feat. Rihanna)

[Rihanna]
I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost

[Drake: Verse 1]
I’ve asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn’t change
And I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? please don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours we both know
We know, they don’t get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can’t sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste,ah
Pushing me away so I give her space,ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn’t break
I’ll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don’t know
Trying to run from that, say you’re done with that
On your face girl, it just don’t show
When you’re ready, just say you’re ready
When all the baggage just ain’t as heavy
And the party's over, just don’t forget me
We’ll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won’t ever have to worry,
You won’t ever have to hide
You've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

[Rihanna]
Cause if you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost

[Drake: Verse 2]
Yeah
It’s my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can’t deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
Cause you don’t say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you’re following your heart
Cause your mind don’t control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don’t be so ashamed
I’ve had mine, you’ve had yours, we both know
We know, you hate being alone
You ain’t the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somethin’ to save you
Instead they say,
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true

[Rihanna]
I know you’ve been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here’s what I’ll do
I’ll take care of you
I’ve loved and I’ve lost ---Lyrics submitted by Caitlyn Smith.

[Intro:]
[Talking/ad-libing: Drake]
It's Young Money Baby
I got something for these niggas to ride to
Fa'sho
Here I go

[Verse 1:]
Let me do me, you just do you
I'm double cupped right now,
Su-woop to the bangers,
Su-woop to the bangers, (yeah)
And I say, I be on some G shit
I be on some G shit
Check out what I done, and
Check out who I be with
I'm me bitch, I said I'm me bitch

Then it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

[Guitar Break]

[Verse 2:]
Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Make sure you don't fall in love,
Cause I don't have the time for that
Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where it's at
When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract

I say I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check some other niggaz for that louis shopping spree shit
Not me bitch, I said not me bitch

And it goes young, young, young, young, YOUNG

[Guitar Break/Breakdown/Solo]

[Outro:]
I a'int have sex in a long time [x3]
Are we havin is sex tonight?
Ladies say, I ain't have sex in a long time
I a'int have sex in a long ass time
Baby, I ain't have sex in a long time
Are we havin is sex tonight, sex tonight---Lyrics submitted by Miracle.

[Verse 1]
Uh
I’m just so far gone
October’s own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screaming in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on
Where did we go wrong
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game
And its one I can’t post pone
Meaning if it rains
I’m the one its raining on
With my diamond chain’s on
Still nothing setting stone
Women borrow sweaters
That I spray with my cologne
And tell me don’t forget them
And I promise that I won’t
Feeling so distant from everyone I’ve known
To make everybody happy
I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown
Parties that we’ve thrown
I done more for this city
Than these rappers that have blown
Its only been 3 years
Look at how I’ve grown
I’m just in my zone
I call this shit the calm

Yeah

But I’m the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom
And I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay
And it wont even take that long
You can see it in my face
Even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school
Its proven and its known
I’m sittin’ in a chair
But in the future, it’s a throne
I know you like to worry
It’d be better if you don’t
Cuz….

[Spoken]
You know…
Everything gone be all right
I promise
I apologize to you know
Put y’all in this position
40 Mama always say
Don’t ask permission, just ask forgiveness you know
So uhh
Forgive me
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became
Tryna make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a vantage you can gain
They love it when you smile
Unaware that it’s a strain
It’s a curse you gotta live with
When you’re born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say you’re the one to blame
Tryna enjoy myself with Terrence in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
It’s a weight that’s on my chest
Who ever spottin’ me is playin’
So I’m liftin’ all alone
Trynin’ not to get a sprain
Hopin’ Western Junior doin’ currency exchange

Cuz my dad called
It got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like
I had a rolls and I went and got a range
And he payin’ for his cigarettes
With some dollars and some change
Yeah
And I can only feel his pain
Cuz in Memphis, Tennessee
There is only so much to attain
So I’m fillin’ out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me
I just hope he doesn’t say that shit in vain
I’m why your girls heart is in a slain
Call me Heartbreak Drake
I’m the hardest one to tame
As a man, I’m just honest
As an artist, I’m a king
With my own set of problems
That be sittin’ on my brain
Yeah
And see this is the thang
What they viewin’ as braggin’
Is the way that I maintain
The shit I write
While starin’ out the window of a plane
Is the single handed reason I remain

Me

[Spoken]
Yeah…
I said I call this shit the calm
But I’m the furthest thing from calm
That’s why I’m putting on
They always wanna ask what type of act that you putting on
Like…. Damn ---Lyrics submitted by Marjorie.

(feat. Sampha)

It's not me and you
It's not me it's you
Your reckless and you know it
They don't love you like I do
Say you're moving over, like guess that's just the motion

I guess that's just the motion (oooh) [x4]

I don't have a fuck to give
I been moving state to state
In my leather and my Tims
Like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chubb
That's my nigga from the way
On the East side of the city
That's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling
'Cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it
I can never do no wrong
When they need a favor from ya man they don't leave you alone

But, I guess that's just the motion
And your phone doesn't ring when they got everything
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (oooh) [x2]

Yeah,
Looking back on it at least my pride is in tact
'Cause we said no strings attached
And I still got tied up in that
Every thing that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her
And she know it
The girl that I want to save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that want to be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help

But, I guess that's just the motion
Yeah, she'll probably come around soon as I settle down
That's the motion (ooh)
I guess that's just the motion (ooh) [x10]---

[Intro]
Yesterday when we were getting high
you were invited, you woulda liked it
uh uh ah, I know you all too well
we said that we can kiss the past goodbye
but your weren't excited
there's no way to fight it
you can stay shawty but here I go

[Drake - Verse 1]
Should I spend the weekend in Vegas
I'm busy living the moment not taking pictures to save it
I mean how could I forget
my memories never faded I can't relate to these haters
my enemies never made it
I am... still here with who I started with
the game needed life, I put my heart in it
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr sh-t
carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship
yeah, I'm 23 with a money tree
growing more too, I just planted 100 seeds
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist and thats how she met my pops
and now my garden is enormous, it's happening penny lane
I said its happening Penny Lane
just like you said I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead
uh ahh, thats word to the millions that they putting up
I'm trying to do better than good enough!

[Chorus]
What am I afraid of
this is what dreams are supposed to made of
the people I don't have time to hang with
always look at me and say the same sh-t

You promised me you would never change
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh

You promised me you would never change
oh, huh huh
oh, huh huh

[Drake - Verse 2]

Am I wrong for making light of my situation
clap on when 40 got something for me to snap on
NOw that I'm on I dont want to worry about getting back on
I'm just trying to stay on
get my f-cking buffett on
I heard they jsut moved my grandmother to a nursing home
and I'll be acting like I don't know how to work a phone
but hit redial you'll see that I just called some chick I met at the mall
that I barely know at all and
plus this women that I mess with unprotected txt us saying she wish she woulda kept it
the one I'm laying next to just looked over and read it
I couldn't tell you where the f-ck head is
I'm holding on by a thread its like I'm high right now
the guy right now and you can tell by looking at my eyes right now
that nothing really comes as a surprise right now
cause we having the time of our lives right now

[Chorus]

[Drake - Verse 3]
I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
the other day Lissa told me she missed the old me
which made me question when I went missing
and when I start treating my friends different
maybe it was the fast pace switch up or the 2 guns in my face during the stick up
maybe cause I girl I f-cking trusted set the whole sh-t up
but a fact I have'nt seen 'em since they locked big Rich up
I know, the same time, I'm quick to forget
bout to roll me a blunt with my list of regrets
burn it al burn it all, I'm starting it fresh
cause half the itme I got it right I probably guessed
did I just trade free time for camera time
will I blow all of this money baby, hammertime
yeah, I just need some closure, aint no turning back for me
I'm in it till it's over---Lyrics submitted by John.

[Verse 1]
Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn’t be driving, it just got so much harder
Can’t even see straight, I can’t even see straight
Oh, fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, cause niggas die a lot, and lie a lot
But I’m the truth that’s right I fucking said it
The living proof that you ain’t gotta die to get to heaven
You Girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How’d I know, how’d I know? That’s me on some psychic shit
I could tell a lie if you asking me my where-abouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rappin’ bitches, rappin’ bitches bitches
And rappin’ rappin’ an’ bitches until all of us switches
I swear, it’s been two years since somebody ask me who I was
I’m the greatest, man, I said that before I knew I was
That’s whats important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing “walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I’m a uptown nigga, ah”
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I’m getting back to my ways

[Hook]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I’m an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I’m down to spend whatever, lately I’ve been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper thats gon’ tell me that she don’t dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, that’s all I’m really good for
Memphis Tennessee no, see I start to go deep back
In Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin’ furs like its snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me that’s the shit that she like
So why am I a classic, this is who I’m trying to be like
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turnin’ papers in won’t get me paid
If I don’t nothing I’mma ball
I’m countin all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah I need that, making major changes to the life I’m living
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I’m getting back to my ways



People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I’m an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause I’m down to spend whatever, lately I’ve been on a roll
And I do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city, (UGK fuck these other niggas)---Lyrics submitted by shatyaanderson.

[Drake]
This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I havn’t slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed to go our seperate ways
So i’m single...
Thinking about what we had and missing you
But I aint santa, I got something for these bad b*tches too
I mean paprazzi on me trying not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby don’t hold on too long cause that’s how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthaf*ckin heart out, its drizzy
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you can’t escape me do I ever cross your mind
Because all this sh*t is new to me, i’m learning to behave
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save
But I’m good
I know that n*ggas would kill for this lifestyle
I’m looking forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin from where I came
And no matter where I’m headed
I promise to stay the same

[Young Jeezy]
I’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest n*gga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest

[Chorus]
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me

(I'm doin my thing 3x)
I'm tryna be unforgettable...

[Young Jeezy]
This just might be my realest flow ever
When I say fo' life yall say fo'ever
Its hard but it's fair I told that girl life hurts
The closest your gon get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The names young baby you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I’m gon need a thug wife
Yeah, I’m talking his and her firearms
Know our jewelry probably louder than a car alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a snickers bar
Yeah, I’m talking caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly in these feathers
(?) so whats the deali young done everything in the A but f*ck chillin
So welcome to my life no two days the same
Like for yall to meet the love of my life her names the game

[Young Jeezy]
I’m just riding round the city with my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl I’m the realest n*gga she been around
I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talking bout the greatest

[Chorus]
(I just really hope that)
You'll think of me

You'll think of me

[Drake]
Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn’t everything
I’m having a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that i'm the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, every time 
She ain't trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well never mind,
I I I tried to told you, drizzy still ain’t nothing nice
Bracelet saying you should quit, cars saying fuck ya life
Okay now we outta here
Toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up
I got the voodoo for you bitches
I’m busy getting rich, I don’t want trouble
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double
Famous like a drug that I've taken too much
I never ever trip
Just peace happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does

[Chorus - Drake]
I'm about whatever man..
Fuck what they be talking about,
They opinion doesn't count,
We the only thing that matters (oooh)
So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night..
Whole crews in here
Cause I don't really know who Imma lose this year (oooh)
Man I love my team. Man I love my team..
I would die for these niggas..

[Nicki Minaj]
Yo, Drizzy sayin' get her Imma get her
I get the kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda... wait wait fixate!
Which bitch you know made a million off a mix tape?
That was just a keepsake
Bought the president the Louie presidential briefcase
Never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks I ain’t talking about the peach state
Man for Petes sake scratch that, sweep stakes
(hahahaha)
Fuck I look like hoe
I look like yes and you like no
I’m a bad bitch I ain’t never been a mixed breed.
I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed
M M M6 from a M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu
But I collect 100 thou at the venue
And pop bottles with my team young money til the death of me

[Chorus]
I'm about whatever man..
Fuck what they be talking about,
They opinion doesn't count,
We the only thing that matters (oooh)
So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night..
Whole crews in here
Cause I don't really know who Imma lose this year (oooh)
Man I love my team. Man I love my team..
I would die for these niggas..

[Nicki Minaj]
I mean we don't even rock them shoes if it ain't got a comma on the price tag
I mean, I mean but then again who looks at the price tag, you know

[Drake]
Oh yeah we in this bitch
Oww, oww, oww

[Chorus]
I'm about whatever man..
Fuck what they be talking about,
They opinion doesn't count,
We the only thing that matters (oooh)
So we do it how we do it
All up in your face, man, I hate to put you through it
I be up all night..

[Lil Wayne:]
Yeah, uh-huh

[Drake:]
Uh, hardly home but always reppin,
You hardly on and always second,
When I'm awake you always restin,
And when they call you the answer you will hardly question,
I, I'm doin classic shit in all my sessions,
Other nigga's situations they are all depressin,
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions,
I just always did my own thing,
Now I run the game, you stupid muddasuckas
I see all this money through my ohio state buck eyes,
Shippin goin good, but good can turn to better,
Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her

[Chorus:]
It's okay [x6]
You can run an tell your friends that

Best believe I understand
It's okay [x6]
You can run an tell my city

You can run an tell my city it's on

[Drake:]
Yeah, wrong way down the one way,
Women don't get saved round me even on a sunday,
Damn where I get it from, these niggas always wonder who,
Then they meet my pop and tell 'I'm ''Drake is just a younger you'',
And shawty wanna party so don't let yo girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ, of me givin her mouth-to-mouth,
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her,
I drop two black cars I named 'em Malcom X an Martin Luther
I don't ever play but I'm in the game lady,
They just loose to love, those are tennis games lady,
Have you countin money goin dufflebag-crazy,
Sippin on Pink Floyd an puffin Wayne Brady,
Damn, who's line is it anyways,
I'm in the daze, you been amazed, y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage,
I'm on fire yup I've been a blaze,
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right,
You look nice, and yo frame, makes me wanna bowl a strike
Well alright, guess I might, know what fuck it yes I will,
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin less than real
Put it to you right

[Chorus:]
It's okay [x6]
You can run an tell your friends that

Best believe I understand
It's okay [x6]
You can run an tell my city

You can run an tell my city it's on

[Bun B:]
Bun B King of the Trill also one of the dopest,
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused,
The gangstas recognize me for my locc ness no joke it's,
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a Locus,
Or maybe like a python that's the type a shit I'm on,
I wrote this on my iPhone so let me drop this ibomb, I palm
The game like it's a spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great mike,
Bun an Wayne an Drake in here man this gon be a great night,
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white,
Try to cross me over I just fake left then I break right,
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night,
This that major moment you've been waitin on for too long,
The best that ever did it an doin it on a new song,
UGK an Young Money too strong
Down in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

[Chorus:]
It's okay [x6]
You can run an tell your friends that
I'm on [x6]
Best believe I understand
It's okay [x6]
You can run an tell my city
I'm on [x6]
You can run an tell my city it's on

[Lil Wayne:]
I am the leather jacket, black glasses, all american bad boy

Boys, now listen, we got more motherfuckin' TV screens
On the outside the damn tour bus than on that motherfucker. Boys playin' Playstation
We come through motherfuckin' hang gliding
Off motherfuckin' Versace skyscrapers
I don't get it, what more can you ask for?

Yeah, sound sound sound
Yeah, real 6 side shit
Sickos, ah man

Yeah, when you get to where I'm at
You gotta remind 'em where the fuck you at
Every time they talkin' it's behind your back
Gotta learn to line 'em up and then attack
They gon' say your name on them airwaves
They gon' hit you up right after like it's only rap
Jewels look like I found a motherfuckin' treasure map
And ain't told no one where the fuck it's at
Shout out to the G's from the ends
We don't love no girls from the ends
I'm gon hit 'em with the wham once again
I'mma always end up as a man in the end, dog
It's just apparent every year
Only see the truth when I'm staring in the mirror
Lookin' at myself like, there it is there
Yeah, like there it is there man, whoo
I ain't tryna chance it
I be with the bands like a nigga went to Jackson State
Or Grambling
Young Nick Cannon with the snare drum, dancin'
Watch the way I handle it, uh
Bring it to the bedroom, you know that shit is candle lit
She know I'm the man with it, uh
With the bands like I must've went to Clark, went to Hampton
I ain't playin' with it

I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

Way more gully gully than buddy buddy
Never needed your acceptance, never needed nothin'
You don't understand, I'm the only one to hear from
You don't understand that it's me or nothin'
Yea, I'm fuckin' glowin' up
Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that
Woah, dance our dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we bout to land I can call to tell the wolves I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valley at the Hazy
Think I had the shit that had the city going crazy

When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over Pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch

Let's just let bygones be bygones, okay?
Let's just go ahead and just let bygones be bygones
I pull up lookin' like a damn cyborg, weighin' 224
Oh man, these boys don't even understand
Listen when you see OVO Jodi pull up on the scene with Drake
For goodness sakes, well for goodness sakes
You see this mixtape you listenin' to? This an album
Yea, we could have, we could have sold it to you for 17.99
Or 29.99 with the shirt, buy it at the Target
These motherfuckers trippin' so hard I had to look down and double check cause I thought they had their shoes tied together
Motherfuckers got they shoes tied together
What more could you ask for?
Boys harassing me with these questions
How about this?
How about don't ask me no more motherfucking questions
We ain't doing no interview---

Been a minute since we've slept together
Gotta get myself together
I've been thinkin' about everything
I don't know if it's because I'm lonely
Lonely on a Wednesday night, girl, I'm lonely
I'll admit it if you just keep quiet, girl, I'm lonely
That shit ain’t my fault, girl cause I'm lonely

Name another woman
Ain't no other woman that should comfort me when I’m lonely
Mixing Remy, little bit of Henny
I'm running on empty, I'm lonely
When I’m lonely, when I’m lonely

Heard you spent your summers in Miami
At somebody’s house that you didn’t buy
You’re young, yeah, have fun, girl, but I hope it was worth it
Cause fuck it, I’m not here to judge
Fuck it, I’m not here to love everything you did to ball
Fuck it, I'm just glad you called
Ring ring ring, what a thing
Ring ring ring, school bell, I ring
You and I got options, bae

This shit ain’t my fault---

[Intro]
Worst...

[Verse 1]
Mothafucka never loved us, fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now, still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police asking us questions, nigga we don't know shit
Flexing! Nigga, I'm just flexing
Nigga never loved us, do it look like we stressing?
Look at you, look at you and look at you, aww, I'm glad that they chose us
Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish, just to see if I'm finished

[Hook]
On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us... Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up?
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior

[Verse 2]
Hold up, hold my phone, mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us, now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us, so everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done grown up! You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money when I come for that shit like O.D.B

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothing changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
And it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playing with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stunting, I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm coming back on my worst behavior

[Outro]
Remember? Remember? Mothafucka, remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka, remember? Worst behavior---Lyrics submitted by maleiah.

[Hook]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thang
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

[Bridge]
How you feel about coming home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9am in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse 1]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas lookin' like "Preach"
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowin' that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's gettin' into me
I just like the rush when you see your enemy somewhere in the club
And you realize he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life and this life started lackin' synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it’s meant to be
Paranoid, always rollin' with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

[Hook]---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.

Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, "I heard you back with you know who
I told her, "girl, I'm always back with you know who"
And she like, "who are we kidding? You're 27, you just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you"
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolving
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is a time of a life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me ,momma
What more they want from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
Cause I'm not acting tough
Ir making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around rolling stones
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma
Hard labor let me pay the price
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life---
