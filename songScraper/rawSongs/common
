(Hook)
Everybody home; ain't nobody gone
And I got all my niggas around
It feel good, don't it? Getting hood on it
And I got all my niggas around
I got a couple minutes in town,
A couple hundred bitches around
So baby go on and get us a round
Cause I got all my niggas around
Celebrate

[Verse 1]
We partying, yeah, got body in
Exotic broads lobbying, Spanish, Somalian
Fly, we live it 'til we die
We living in the night, toast, looking in her eye
On our paper 'til we get it like Dubai
Chi niggas stand up, plastic cups
Girls with the drastic butts, that ask for bucks
It don't stop here
Bottles of Veuve pop here
And we gonna get around like 2Pac's here
Celebrate like it's New Year
some bomb rocks coming, type nuclear
Yeah, it's so ridiculo
Lit the medicinal, passed it give-and-go
Backwards liquor store
Celebrate

(Hook)
Everybody home, ain't nobody gone
And I got all my niggas around
It feel good don't it? Getting hood on it
And I got all my niggas around
I got a couple minutes in town
A couple hundred bitches around
So baby go on and get us a round
Cause I got all my niggas around
Celebrate

[Verse 2]
In my Paul Smith like an alcoholic
My guys I used to hoop with, is now who I ball with
This raw bitch came in looking flawless
Tonight she'll be giving conscious, headlights!
Beaming from the Beemer that her momma bought her
I got the act right for her like I'm an author
Look where drama brought us; look where karma brought us
Married to the game, like Usher we was caught up
Now we got some R&B broads we can call up
You niggas come around, keep the wall up
Smoke blowing out thinking of tomorrow and the simple things
Hustlas from the go, how far we done came
Celebrate

(Hook)
Everybody home, ain't nobody gone
And I got all my niggas around
It feel good, don't it? Getting hood on it
And I got all my niggas around
I got a couple minutes in town
A couple hundred bitches around
So baby go on and get us a round
Cause I got all my niggas around

[Verse 3]
Ah, another night, we love the night
For the life, getting bugged tonight
Wait 'til I get my money right
Told you it's gonna be on like the Benzes that we lean on
Put my team on, get our heat on
Ah, I knew her when she strip, her name was Chardonnay
My niggas move work even on a holiday
We come from porches and alleyways
I'm the big ticket, don't need no one to validate
You celebrate

{Bridge}
We ain't gotta wait
It's a toast to you and me
Bills ain't so bad, celebrate that
Party in the yard 'til the lights come on
Ain't nobody crying
We've come for far, been climbing
Know the clouds they passed us by
C'monn and raise your glass up high

(Hook)
Everybody home, ain't nobody gone
And I got all my niggas around
It feel good, don't it? Getting hood on it
And I got all my niggas around
I got a couple minutes in town
A couple hundred bitches around
So baby go on and get us a round
Cause I got all my niggas around
Celebrate

Walk up in the thing, got my campaign poppin'
Champagne poppin', bad thing poppin'
Headed to the door, and ain't a damn thing knockin' (no)
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin'
Campaign poppin', champagne poppin'

I wrote this on my born day, it was a warm day
Niggas gotta eat, we gon' do it gourmet
I'm hearing fuckin' voices, like when porn play
Stay, stay on your grind like foreplay
What more can I say? Diamonds off for the day
That means to shine, you find a way
Stayed on porches, backyards, and gangways
Learned strange ways between Cole and Langley
Champagne ambitions
I pour it out for my man who made his transition
Wars about paper, pussy, pride and ego
Born to fly, call me the bald eagle
Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though
Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin
The hero that came from zero
My bars and my PR like Puerto Rico
This bra from the DR said I was frío
That's Ice Cold like Dre, triple three yo
Pinot noir style, better with time
I'm gambling with watches getting better with time
So I'mma ride this out for long as God allow me
They say "time is money", forever is my salary
I shine tomorrow with what I do today
Yo, get this money, put the diamonds on display

Walk up in the thing and got my campaign poppin'
Champagne poppin', bad thing poppin'
Headed to the door, and ain't a damn thing knockin' (no)
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin'
Campaign poppin', champagne poppin'
Hit you with the street sweeper now you gotta get to moppin' (no)

Ay, ay, ay , ay , ay, ay, ay, ay
Tryna get it every way, every day
Tryna get it every way, every day
Tryna get it every way, every day

Bars in alignment, stars in alignment
Raw off consignment, God's in the diamonds
Evolve from the science, power and refinement
Read between the lines, hard to define us
Niggas that's behind us, throwing up signs to signify us
In the Benz leaning like we biased
I've seen Len Bias, that shit scared me
You can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash
The moment is to live it like your last
Moments that we have never living in the last
My time, man, precious like diamonds
Look through the glass, see what I magnify man
I'mma be shining 'til I die man
I'm a rare diamond that's hard to find man
Climbing to the mountain top, MLK day
To the streets I speak my piece like an A.K
47 To 87 to the hundreds
Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted
Dreams reflect clarity, ain't no disparity
Between peace and prosperity, so marry me diamond

Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway
I'm rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day
Way before the ballin' that was back off in the training days
I used to hit the barber chair and say "I need that fadeaway"
Had a crush on what's her name, the feelings never fade away
Older brother gang bang, banging like an 808
Said you can't take his chain away
Real play you can't take his game away
Slang away, walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller
But you can't take my dame away, devil in a red dress
But she got that angel face
I could teach her how to get it day to day to day to day
The G code is my combination
Catch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces
Catch me in court, beating all kinds of cases
Weed, money, pussy, liquor, that's my favorite compilation
Diamonds---

*scratches*
Inhale
(Verse 1)
I breathe deep
Like an old man in a deep sleep
Or an Indian peace pipe
Identity be
The beginning, the end, the first, the last
Breathe into infinity
A verse that lasts
Got a chick in the south that be cursin' fast
When it was she tried a nigga nurse it last (?)

The hunger of a homeless
Microphones
Played the game - it got a bonus
Man is the plan
The master like Tiger
So much is the drive
I am the definition of a rider
Daughter's name means survivor
From a tribe-a
Colliders
Just one word can't describe her
A scribe of the streets
And a good life that we all wanna reach
I'm hotter than a beach
Flow is so deep
Even underwater
I can inhale to bring the world in order

*scratches*
Inhale---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
