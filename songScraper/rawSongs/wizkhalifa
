Around these parts
I'm known as the youngest in charge
My shit bang out the trunk of your car
It's the cities known rap spitta
Semi blown clack niggas
Skin and bones but really known as that nigga
I'm known to chase the bucks
Grind to get my paper up
In the studio writin rhymes till the paper crunch
I'm not the type that you would call em a thug
But I'm a huster it's all in my blood
So if its all for the cheese then I'm in it
My screws kinda loose so I ease to the finish
I hop up in the coupe feel the breeze while I'm in it
Blowin smoke up out the roof from the trees that I'm spliffin
Youngin got the game on lock
I'm on top it's a shame y'all not
You a lame put your brain on pot
Leave you wet like the rain y'all drop
I'm gon rock and I ain't gon stop

[chorus]

Who's the kid spittin flames
Changin the game
His name, it's Wiz Khalifa man
From the home of the greats
Where they known for the cake
The place, that steel city damn
I got that Pittsburgh sound
And I'mma always hold Pittsburgh down
It's Wiz Khalifa man
You can't tell by now
Pittsburgh I'mma swell my town
That steel city damn
Roll rubber you don't know who you dealin with
Oh so innocent but flows so diligent
My spit game's like a 44 killin shit
Know your man warm but the young ball killin shit
Realist shit and your main wife dig me
Game try and hit me
Kick game like 50 Cent
Niggas wanna play games I quickly
Mob with a squad that will bang out wit me
And they want the kid still hurtin
Hundred niggas wit hammers
Yea, that's what I call a steal curtain
I handle my time and still work it
Put in work couple mill worth in
And I'm from Pittsburgh where the green
and the eatin is good
And the fiends do everything in the hood
Everyday is like a war so my soldiers ride fatigues in the hood
And we gettin all the green like we should

[chorus]

Who's the kid spittin flames

CHORUS - (WIZ KHALIFA)

I'm lookin' for a...Buss down
Every time I hit a city, if you ever see her with me and she rollin'
Then she gotta be a buss down
And she get it like a pro, ain't nobody gotta know
Hell no she ain't a hoe, she a buss down
A couple swishers feelin' right
Yeah I hope that ain't your wife, cuz' tonight
Shawty lookin' like a buss down
Say she know me I'm the man, I understand
She wanna ride with the (camp..?), then she gotta be a buss down

VERSE 1 - (WIZ KHALIFA)

When I touch ground, I need a line of them bussies when I come 'round
Ridin' butter-soft, leather seats in my truck now
They throw it at me I receive it for the touchdown
She gotta be a buss down
Ray got my cigarillo smellin' right
Tell her what it's hittin' for and I ain't gotta tell her twice
And it's goin' down tonight, ain't got the time to take you out
I'm only in town tonight, f*ck the waitin' bout
I'm tryin' to crush now, I got her star-struck
Heard that I just signed a major deal, I'm gettin' star bucks
Got you goin' ballistic tryin' to get back to my tour bus
Hope you brought a couple friends here with you cuz' there's more of us
Booshe hoes be borin' us, she gotta be about it
Got any ounce of attitude then I can do without it
She gotta be a sure (fire..?), thick (fire..?), knock a whole clique down
Go hard, work a day job, on the weekend she a buss down

CHORUS - (WIZ KHALIFA)

Every time I hit a city, if you ever see her with me and she rollin'

And she get it like a pro, ain't nobody gotta know

She wanna ride with the (camp..?), then she gotta be a buss down

VERSE 2 - (WIZ KHALIFA)

It's a must now, you in here with your man it's time to put them cuffs down
Say you ain't with cheatin', got you creepin' on the hush now
Ain't never smoked before I got you hittin' blunts now
Watch your average n*gga holla at ya and get shut down
Know exactly who I am, she put her front down
Flyer than a motherf*ckin' nothin' but that (Newnan's..?)
Know she a buss down, no she say I don't usually do this
You're borderline exclusive that's why you off in my new sh*t
That body get you what you want and you know how to use it
All I do is tell em' who I am and b*tches lose it
I'm all about my paper dawg, she in love with my music
All eyes on me, I feel like I'm the new kid
A zombie, I make her give me brains till' she stupid
And if she ain't a certified, ride-or-die, got a mean backside
Let me and my team get right, then I turn her to a buss down

CHORUS - (WIZ KHALIFA)

Every time I hit a city, if you ever see her with me and she rollin'
Then she gotta be a buss down
And she get it like a pro, ain't nobody gotta know

This Plane

Everyone Call me man
Taylor Gang or Die
And this project is brought to you by (its deal or no deal)
Champagne, and paper planes too
Rostrum Records
Taylor Gang, Happy Hustle
Yeaah Bitch

[Verse]
Screamin fuck them niggas who hated, I'm money affiliated
Speculating me landing, must of got me mistaken with lame nigga's
Know you gone get high as fuck as long as the planes with ya
Left that major situation alone and became richer
People talkin' down but see I'm the same nigga
Leave ya bitch around we gone drink this champagne wit her
We don't touch the ground see a cloud with my name it,
Only ez-widers, please no cigars for me and my gang
Fool I'm a legend in these streets that's how I do my thang
And Don't where the fitted, I got the city on my chain
Oh, man still they hate talkin smack, knowing if I was gone there be no throne to throw ya rocks at
Cruising at maximum altitudes I'm tryna top that
So in touch with the real them haters tryna stop that
But I, live or let die, party get high
And tell them lames to the plane or let fly

[Chorus]
Don't know they hate for
Just gettin my paper
Well maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone
I don't wanna leave, but I need to, it's such a shame...
They gone miss this plane (plane)...
They gone miss this plane (plane)...
They gone miss this plaaane (plaaane)...
They gone miss this plane (plane)...
I try to believe you, I don't wanna leave but I need to..

[Verse 2]
Uh, stuck alone in this wave race
Say I'm living to fast, don't plan on changing my pace
Got one foot on the gas, it's never a need for brakes
Smoke ez-wider's with hash, fuck bitches from out of state
Valet bringing me cars, waiter bringing me plates
Shrimp and fillet Mignon, we celebrate buying drinks
Wit a couple of broads and my nigga's who got love for me
It's lonely at the top, I'm tired of having company
Uh, so while you busy trying to fit in, I'm a stand out
And view my life through this lens to see how it pan's out
Substitute teacher ass nigga's, need a handout
Middle finger screaming fuck them nigga's who hated,
I'm money affiliated
Pop another bottle, that chronic smokin degraded
Speculating me landing must of got me mistaken,
I'm speaking as the captain of the planes,
You's a runner on the jet way

[Chorus]
Don't know they hate for
Just gettin my paper
Well maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone
I don't wanna leave, but I need to, it's such a shame...
They gone miss this plane (plane)...
They gone miss this plane (plane)...
They gone miss this plaaane (plaaane)...
They gone miss this plane (plane)...

Chorus:
See we aint worried bout a damn thing, damn thing
And you're talkin it but you not about a damn thing, damn thing
so what you, doin about it not a damn thing, damn thing
keep it movin i've been known for doin my damn thing, damn thing

Verse 1:
You see I'm here now, that's right you not the man
They say i spit coke, supply the block with grams
And I aint with waitin, I'm taking lots of grands
Cause I aint got patience, I'm not a doctor fam
My niggas get it crunk, chump, from the side you from
Smokin something, nigga light yo blunt, aint got your gun we better find you one
Cause this is Pistolvania, where them apes crawl
Bunch of shorties on the corner pocket full of 8 balls
And you'll never gonna see one of my niggas sleep sleep until the cake bomb
Hey what you mean man, something like a cake walk
As far as rap go, yeah it's in the bag
Of course the haters wanna do me bad, prolly mad cause all the shit that i have
I never let em slow me down dawg I'm livin fast
thinkin (?) cause a chick wanna get with a youngin that's all about gettin his cash
I'm still a youngin but, niggas respect the flow
But don't check me, you better check you ho

Chorus (x2)

Verse 2:
I'm in the studio, making classic heat
You niggas made at me, this cash I have to see
And you chumps can amount, out for them ones and I'm bout
Done with you punks and you clowns, wantin to come for the crown
I hear a lotta talk, I gotta let em know
I put the business on a nigga really thinkin that he feelin that he wanna come and test the flow
Cause I'm not for the games, all will you not do a thing
See I was taught you gotta walk if you talk and you say
And it's 4-1-2 til I fall to the grave
They don't know what to do with the ball to this day
Cause I'm always pimpin, if my voice is on a track the whole world gon' listen
Some niggas playa hate but you could say I get away with murder like OJ Simpson
I'm into all day grinding, though not to come easy I'm puttin the time in
The youngin keep rhyming, so that one day I can sit back in reclining---Lyrics submitted by trevor.

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I had a dream that the whole World was staring at me
I woke up and wasn't no one there, yeah eh eaah
Same song to a different beat
Cause sometimes I feels like I'm the only one there
I guess nobody cares, hey
But everythings good until it goes bad
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
It hurts when it don't last
No easy way saying bye
So I'm a spread my wings and head for the sky
And I fly solo
I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I...

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm tired of being tired
And dealing with your BS,
All the while supplying
The money for your request
Without me you're a dime
But with me you're a buck fifty, haha
I can get another one quickly
But I'd rather wade it out
Take the broken pieces try and fix it
Or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision
And I'll be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit
Ha

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Remember what you said
But what you say to me ain't guaranteed to always be the Gospel
I was doing good way before I met you
Now you're off the set
And I'm a let you see the show go on without you
Take a bow... think about it
And hopefully we could be friends but I really doubt it
See you be catching feeling's now and I be catching planes
The story of my life, you're just another page,

[Chorus 2:]
But everythings good until it goes bad
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
It hurts when it don't last
No easy way saying bye
So I'm a spread my wings and head for the sky
And I fly solo
I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I...

[Outro:]
I had a dream that the whole World was staring at me (staring at me)
I woke up and wasn't no one there (no one there)
Yeah eh eaah---Lyrics submitted by hunter.

I bought a whole O to smoke
I'm riding high
 My niggas with me, they down to ride
 I got my change up, they looking like they surprised
 Got niggas hatin' on me hard cause my paper right
 Money from the flo' way up to the sky
 Now they wanna know and they wonder why
 I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly
 I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide
 And I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide
 I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide
 I got my change up, they looking like they surprised
 Niggas hatin' on me hard cause my paper right
 But I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide
 I'm killin' 'em, it's homicide
 I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly
 I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide
 I'm killin' 'em

[Wiz Khalifa:]
 First 48, first 48
 Took out 50 racks and blew the first 48
 I ain't worried about spending bread cause I got more to make
 Soon as they see that Maserati they gone surely hate
 Hundred for a show, can you afford a date
 And that's just one show, imagine what my tour gon make
 Police ran up on my tour bus
 But hey my niggas more money more problems
 More lawyers on the case
 Niggas at the Grammy's
 I was at the crib working
 Heard they little dis but I'm just being the big person
 Never been trained, still my aim near perfect
 Everything I spits murder, bow

[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]

[Chevy Woods:]
 With black on black cars coming through
 Presidential shit, tints on the whip
 So dark can't see who riding in that bitch
 Suits and tie's no questions why
 Somebody get a box ready for these guys
 No four door, had the coupe that ride
 That eagle right here if you wanna feel fly
 No games though, no names spoke
 This crack right here, cocaine flow
 I don't know what you doing but I'm paid bro
 Yeah I pitch that 9 like pedro

[Wiz Khalifa:]
 Stuck in the car with my nigga I'm ready to ride
 We on our way to the top, watch that paper rise

[Chevy Woods:]
 Keep telling everybody what you gonna do
 Middle finger like fuck what you going through
 All I know is that money that I'm going to
 And them gang gang boys wanna bore you
 Like wassup cause I told you
 Just money in the pocket, fold you

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Count another grip, smoke another zip
Yet them young niggas tell it I be on my shit
Make a hundred k, spend it all today
What can I say, my DNA is Givenchy
What my swag is, retarded
What I’m driving, Ferrari
What I’m rocking, Armani, Gianni Versace, huh
Fuck around and I’ll buy one of you broke niggas
My change, insane
My chain, oh that thing

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
It’s nothing, It’s nothing [x8]
Stackin’ cheese till my bread right
Smokin’ weed till my head right
Did it all on my own so, I’mma spend all my bread like
It’s nothing, It’s nothing [x4]
Stackin’ cheese till my bread right
Smokin’ trees till my head right
Did it all on my own so, I’mma spend all my bread like
It’s nothing, It’s nothing [x4]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
You niggas chasin’ money I’m on top of it
If it ain’t money don’t know what the topic is
Don’t come out till next year that mean I’m rockin’ it
Order thirty-seven bottles call it poppin’ shit
Goddamn, what you on?
A private plane, fuck you on
Party in south of France when it’s cold
Used to rock all that old shit till it got old

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
My hair longer than your girl
Go shawty it’s your world
Sub-zero flow, when I spit, I see snow flurries
Scarface, all out
All I want in this world
I mean all I want for lunch, is a blunt, and your girl
It ain’t nothin’ to me but it’s somethin’ to you
Count money like it’s somethin’ to do
Summer time I’m like fuck the roof, winter time I’m in ‘Lo boots
And uh, it’s nothin’
I like being high because it’s a better view
And, I told your ho my chain so cold it’s on Theraflu

Last night I let the party get the best of me
Waking up in the morning: two hoes laying next to me
Plus I heard an officer arrested me
Good weed and cold drinks: that's the motherfuckin' recipe
Nigga and we roll deep [deep], so deep [deep]
It's going down in this bitch: concrete [crete]
We gon' party all night: no sleep
Tell the owner them is all my guys
So tonight everything is on me

The drinks is on me
The bitches, the hotel, the weed is all free
Get high, I mean so high we don't see the whole suite

Chorus:
No driving, no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the dj play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long
Then fly to a level where you gon' need your own key

Leaving from the club now she wanna stay with us
Came to spend it all, don't care what I'm paying for

Used to be too young, now I'm out here buying the bar
Everytime I look up, it's another red cup
Bunch of niggas in the game but they ain't playing with us
They just paying enough
Man them niggas ain't ballin they just laying it up
Saying they does, I'm just rolling hella weed
On my way to the club
I had to wait at the club
But now I don't cause everything is on me

The drinks is on me
The bitches, the hotel, the weed is all free
Get high, I mean so high we gon' see the whole street
We fly, I mean so fly we need a whole wing

No driving, no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the dj play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long

Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party
Let's party alright

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1]
It's the champagne pourin'
Big joint rollin'
Bombay sippin'
No blunt smoking
Bad bitch gettin'
Thick and she got some friends with her
I take 'em out pourin' shots of liquor
Drinkin' out the bottle, smiling in all my pictures
The marijuana loud so them hoes follow like twitter
nigga, you know everything Taylored
Don't rush to the bar fool, if you ain't got no paper
That's the rules, high as fuck, sloppy drunk when I'm passing through
Rollin' doobies up, ya hoe who we pass 'em to
Hit the club spend this money up, roll another one, drink, act a fool
That's what I have to do

[Chorus]
See after drinking champagne all night
Never worry bout a damn thing, y'all might
Homie I'm on my level (yeh)
I'm on my level (yeah)
I'm on my level (yeh)
I'm on my level (yeaah)

So let me take one shot to the brain
And I order three more shots
I'm going in, ayy
I'm on my level (yeh)
I'm on my level (yeah)
I'm on my level (yeh)
I'm on my level (yeaah)

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 2]
Spent a couple dollars on my engine
motor roaring when I back out the garage
Gin got me drunk as fuck stumbling out the bar
Plus I'm struggling tryna find the keys to my car
Cause I be going hard, roll the camera
Life just like a movie, I'm the star
Wish you was in my position
You too broke to play the part
Of course I keep some bad women with me in the back
Sippin' Rose with some hash twistin'
All about a dollar, my team in the cash gettin'
Straight out the burb, we drinking we smash niggas
So when I say I'm balling, that don't mean that I'm playing mate
All my diamonds talkin', you can see what they sayin' mayne

[Chorus]

[Too $hort]
In the middle of the night, early in the mornin'
From the streets to the sheets with some freaks, I ain't yawnin'
I'm wide awake, we ain't eatin', we ain't sleepin'
These bitches so high man, we ain't even speakin'
We just freakin'
You rollin' with short dog baby
She was high on that pill so I fucked yo lady
Come to my house I give 'em everything they want
I might not dot it, but I give to ya women
Cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, GHB, Marijuana
She can suck it if she wanna
I got tequila, Ciroc and two freaky friends
and this a Wednesday night, this ain't the weekend

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Man I'm high as fuck
Man I swear I'm on my level
Man I'm sloppy drunk
Man I swear I'm on my level
I finna pass out
man I swear I'm on my level
A nigga get smashed out
Man I swear I'm on my level

Man I'm high as fuck
Man I swear I'm on my level
Man I'm sloppy drunk
Man I swear I'm on my level
I finna pass out

Yup, yeah yeah
Yup, yeah yeah
Oh, hahahaha
Yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup
Yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup yup
I got enough weed to last me for the rest of my motherfuckin' life
Ain't gon' ever run out
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Uh, get the cork out the bottle
Get that money up and make your style a lil harder to follow
I've been hustlin' all the time, that's the only thing I know
Now my watch is worth 30 thousand, got Cuban links and Italian
Boy I'm gettin' it
Ridin' in my ride lookin' filthy rich
Killin' these niggas I ain't innocent, my bad
Ain't paid the cost, see they just watch me then copy my swag
Say I fell off that's where you lost me
How's that when my name is in my upholstery
I'm rollin' up and goin' places across seas
Hopin' the neighbor don't smell the shit I bake
And every day I'm on another plane
I hardly sleep, but hey I wouldn't have it any other way

Now here we are, now there we go
You rollin' on to where we smoke it all today
Now here we are, now there we go, now there we go
Now here we are
I wake up and I bake up, get my things and catch a plane
But I'll be back again (Now there we go), back again (Now there we go)
Now here we are
I wake up and I bake up, get my things and catch a plane
But I'll be back again (Now there we go), back again (Now there we go)

Uh, so much money that when I pull up
Hop out and walk in the bank teller look at me funny
Know how much I get, know I'm liable to walk up in this bitch
Like Tony with big blue bags of this shit
And tell 'em, "Count it up"
Ridin' round in that ? got OG kush in my body
My nigga I keep it G and that's Gucci or that Giani
I'm gettin' dressed for the airport to pose for the paparazzi
Mo' money, mo' problems, not how I see, huh
Mo' money, mo' Roberto Cavalli, bruh
Damn, ain't it funny how time pass
Only nigga in first class

Now here we are, now there we go
You rollin' on to where we smoke it all today
Now here we are, now there we go, now there we go
Now here we are
I wake up and I bake up, get my things and catch a plane
But I'll be back again (Now there we go), back again (Now there we go)
Now here we are
I wake up and I bake up, get my things and catch a plane
But I'll be back again (Now there we go), back again (Now there we go)---Lyrics submitted by tyler hood.

[Verse 1:]
I cop me one, cop me one for my old girl
You think she my newest bitch, she my old girl
Khalifa, a younger nigga who handle his
Hoes get in my car, ask what the channel is
Boss shit, look that up nigga, I handle biz
On fire, like a candle is
Niggas be dressing off the manikin
Hmmm, and I get fresh like where them camera's is
Better yet sandwiches, bad bitch Spanish friends
Coulda been the President, rather be the man instead

[Hook:]
Now when I get paid, my checks be lookin' like phone numbers
Now when I get paid, my checks be lookin' like phone numbers
(You can talk shit bitch, I'm worth a million)
I'm talkin' millions, nigga I'm talkin' millions
(You can talk shit bitch, I'm worth a million)
I'm talkin' millions, nigga I'm talkin' millions

Time is money so I went and bought a Rolex (bought a Rolex)
Time is money so I went and bought a Rolex (bought a Rolex)
I'm talkin' millions, nigga I'm talkin' millions
(You can talk shit bitch, I'm worth a million)
I'm talkin' millions, nigga I'm talkin' millions
(You can talk shit bitch, I'm worth a million, whaaaaaat)

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I'm in the hood [?] on this something corner surfing
Float, no water, my trunk is waving, I'm polar surfing
Blowing faces, I'm shittin' on them diamond infested
Time is money, peep the wrist bitch, my time is invested
I'm still the king and I'm thugged out
Any block any club I flood it out
I ain't the one for competition I'm a blow it out
I'm going hard I don't ever plan on going out
I'm getting money, probably something you don't know about
I stunt hard, you would swear that I was showin' out
Don't tell me get 'em, I got em and I'm a throw 'em out
And back door on these hoes that I was warning out
While I'm in this machine, convert the top
Tell them that the sky is the limit
With a four of freaks, she got her face in my lap so deep you would think
That she was hiding in it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Shrimp, steak, liquor and pasta
Real shit boi, these niggas imposters
They deserve an Oscar, Kevin Costner
Oh my God sir, what?
I got this and that and everything I want like I got a hostage, yeh
Countin' 7 digits, no wonder why the money calling
Got ya bitch panties Niagra fallin'
Dollars cum like I fuck in the bank
I told them I could, they tell me I can't
They want me to trip when I'm dicking the paint
I'm poppin' champagne and puffin' on dank
Shining hard, boy, these niggas gotta see me
My dick hard, your bitch is easy
(Boi, boi, boi)

[Intro -The Weeknd]
 She's about to earn some bragging rights
 I'm 'bout to give it up like I've been holding back all night
 Girl, take pride in what you want to do
 Even if that means a new man every night inside of you
 Baby, I don't mind
 You can tell by how I roll
 Cause my clique hard and my cup cold
 My talk slurred cause I’m so throwed
 And I'm wiping sweat from my last show
 And he's TG and I'm XO
 I'm only here for one night
 Then I'mma be a memory
 Say it in my ear, so I can hear what you're saying to me
 I got cups full of that Rose
 Smoke anything that's passed to me
 Don't worry 'bout my voice
 I won't need it for what I'm about to do to you

[Hook x2]
 Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
 I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
 All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
 Make me remember you like you remember me

[Verse 1 - Wiz Khalifa]
 Old rapping ass
 Light years past the class
 Hit it, don't have to pass
 Nigga, we the new Aftermath
 Niggas after fame, I just had to laugh
 Niggas after fame, I'm after cash
 You's a fan, I'm a player
 I'm the man, you's a hater
 And I only smoke papers
 That's how you tell I'm Taylor'd
 Nigga listen
 Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen
 And not a thing goes down without permission
 Look, everything I got on I was made for
 Everything that I got I done came for
 All the shit that you see I done slaved for
 All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for
 Need I say more
 Spend so much money on clothes
 Said fuck a store, making my own
 I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along
 And know I was rolling one while I was making this song
 Pour out some shots
 You're taking too long
 Young and I'm rich
 And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Wiz Khalifa]
 I'm on some gin, you on some gin
 I'm moving slow, I'm driving fast
 I hit the weed, you take the wheel
 We lose control
 Drop the top in that 69
 And that motor roar in that old Chevelle
 Can’t say a thing, how you supposed to feel
 Stacking all of this paper, dawg
 I like to call this shit old news
 It means haters jocking our old moves
 Popping champagne cause we made it
 Back of the Phantom, we faded
 All of this shit that I did I probably won't remember tomorrow---Lyrics submitted by Aliya Smith.

(House Party Freestyle)

Nigga I smoke good everyday
I probably live the life that you wish you could everyday
You probably think I had it good, had it made
But nigg' I'm from the 'burg I was in the hood everyday
But now I'm hopping offa Jets
These people cutting me checks
And I say people cause I'm rich
And rich people show me respect (Show me respect)
This come from Atrium, he's from Collette
These diamonds I got on, they are baguettes
On DBS so all of 'em see me, used to be just be that dude on the net
Now I'm all on your TV, butler and ask what I wanna get, Bentley or Lamborghini?
Just came home and made 200 grand blew it all in Waikiki
Just came home and made 200 grand blew it all on Luigi
Smoking on 8 ounces told myself ain't often that sleepy
Realest nigga out, it ain't hard to believe me
That's why all the people that you know try their hardest to be me

Cause nigga I smoke good everyday
I probably live the life that you wish you could everyday
You probably think I had it good got it made
But nigg' I'm from the 'burg now roll up the herb

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 1] 
It's your anniversary isn't it? 
And your man ain't acting right 
So you packin' your Domiar luggage up callin' my cell phone, tryin' ta catch a flight 
You know one thing straight, I'll be there girl whenever you call me 
When you at home that's your man, soon as you land you say it's all me 
But shit ain't all G with him no more, you ain't entertained 
Since I meet you a couple months ago you ain't been the same 
Not sayin' I'm the richest man alive but I'm in the game 
As long as you keep it 100 I'mma spend this change, 

[Chorus] 
Whenever you need me 
Whenever want me, 
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly 
Don't care what your friends say, cause they don't know me 
I can be your best friend, and you be my homie 
I ain't gonna flex, I'm not gonna front 
You know if I ball, then we all gonna stunt 
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up 
Whenever you call baby I'll roll up, I'll roll up, I'll roll up 
Whenever you call baby I'll roll up, I'll roll up, I'll roll up 
Whenever you call baby I'll roll up 

[Wiz Khalifa - Verse 2] 
I try to stay out your business 
But on the real you're so obvious 
And if you keep fitting me in your plans and fuckin' up, your man's gonna catch onto us 
That white sand surrounding us 
He be handcuffing, he should work for them officers 
If you rolling I got a spot where I can put you on this medical, and send you home doctored up 
You wanna ride with me cause you say that he boring 
Wake up you rollin' weed, cooking eggs in the morning 
Ain't scared to spend this money I know I'll make more of it 

First you was in the sky, now you say you in orbit 

[Chorus] 

No matter where I am 
No matter where you are, 
I'll be there when it's over baby 
Cause I was there from the start 
No matter if I'm near 
Don't matter if your far 
All you do is pick the phone up lady 
And I'll be there when you call 

[Outro] 
Whenever you need me 
Whenever want me, 
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly 
Don't care what your friends say, cause they don't know me 
I can be your best friend, and you be my homie 
I ain't gonna flex, I'm not gonna front 
You know if I ball, then we all gonna stunt 
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up 
Whenever you call baby I'll roll up 
Whenever you need me 
Whenever want me, 
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly 
Don't care what your friends say, cause they don't know me 
I can be your best friend, and you be my homie

[Wiz Khalifa - verse 1]
And they say they ballin’ but I do it how the pros do
Where we goin next? we gon let my hoes choose
No socks and my boat shoes
Guess a n-gga eating good like whole foods
Not a couple cameras now they bring the whole crew
Bad bitch ride wit me so she pose too
See me and my guys like a plane flown through
Hella high roll up weed up like I’m supposed too
And now I’m into big things
On the building you need to know the tenant rate
Gettin paid still ridin no shirt
Let a b-tch give me brain call it home work
N-ggas try hatin’ on ‘em but it dont work

[Chorus]
Alota shit done change
New clothes new car new things
Sayin boy they used to be at the bottom
Came up thats what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the roof top
Used to not be allowedd in the building
But now we on the roof top
Slow money just better than gettin’ no money

Learn to get good show money, that’s yo money
Get comfortable with it, really know money
Rich n-gga shit, that really goes for me
Self made n-gga, well played
I’m on the plane drinkin’ champagne and lemonade
You tryna copy whats done, I’m tryna innovate
And club owners getting tired of tryna ventilate
BIG MISTAKE
I’m too busy finding places and trips to take
The more I smoke the more money my business make
Remember they used to be like “who is this?”
Now, I’m up in this bitch, they light up like independance day
When you around the real, you keep it real everyday
My n-ggas keep it real, so I hear what they say
Either you getting paid, or you paying to play
Either you on your grind or you stay out the way


[Chorus]
Alota shit done change
New clothes new car new things
Sayin boy they used to be at the bottom
Came up thats what they say


Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the roof top
Used to not be allowedd in the building
But now we on the roof top
Slow money just better than gettin’ no money

[Curren$y]
Uhh, just made a million, got another million on my schedule
The pick up on my Ferrari, you jets or you jetless
You n-ggas aint help us, on second thoughts you did
They hatin was the fuel for this shit so you wrote your own check off a hoe ass
Sweatin bullets at home, wondering if she coming back
? and she she can smell it on ya
Thats why you only see her when you buying stuff for her
We was sneaking in then it was general admission
Now we own the arena deciding who allowed in it
Our windows aint tinted, pimpin, I aint trippin’
Had showered that shit, I’m just ballin’ and chillin
We plooted this out, one night in the city
Now we Los Angeles, medicine cabinet twisting
Our habits are expensive, we gotta have it
Twit-pic’ing when we get it and they mad at us
F-ck them n-ggas


[Chorus]
Alota shit done change
New clothes new car new things
Sayin boy they used to be at the bottom
Came up thats what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the roof top
Used to not be allowedd in the building
But now we on the roof top
Slow money just better than gettin’ no money

[Wiz Khalifa]
Alotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes
When you putting in work, thats how it goes
Alotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes
When you putting in work, thats how it goes
Alotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes
When you putting in work, thats how it goes
Alotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes
When you putting in work, thats how it goes

And if the kids tryna be like me, they probably smoking bout an O.
Oh, aint my fault though!---

(Let’s go)
(It is what it is man..)
(What it was, what it wasn’t)
(Only nigga)
(Uh)

Blow it by the O’
Blow a lot of paper; I got rich when I was young.
Now the folks say that I’m famous,
If you smoke this you’ll get high.
'Wonder what your name is. 
All I do is keep it G my nigga that my second nature.

I’m in New York with the thugs.
Oakland with the scrapers.
London eatin’ Nando smokin’ weed like I’m Jamaican.

Monday all through Sunday, all this money I be makin’.
Never been a pussy, dog and never did no hatin’,
Always been the realest on my section of debatin’
Rollin’ tree, I got some kush in California waitin’

Breakfast on a plane, breakfast on a plane.
Don’t gotta eat when I land,
I had breakfast on a plane.

Diamonds in my time my nig,
My necklace is the same.
Live the way I live, you get respect just for your change.
Come through where I live, you might get checked just for your change
This industry is a bitch my dog, it’s best to use your brain

Keep a couple niggas ‘round that’s tryna do the same.
And make a couple million for you try to make a name
Keep a couple niggas ‘round that’s tryna do the same,
And make a couple million for you try to make a name.

It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn who knew all the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'll be standing right here
Talking to you about another path I
Know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up look at things different see the bigger picture
Those were the days hard work forever pays now I see you in a better place

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride

First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong and what's
Small turn to a friendship a friendship
Turn into a bond and that bond will never
Be broke and the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first then the line
Will never be crossed established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn and that line is what
We reach so remember me when I'm gone

So let the light guide your way hold every memory
As you go and every road you take will always lead you home---

That's my fam, my hold 'em down for eva
Us against the world, we can bottle whomeva
Together ain't no way we gon' fail
You know I got your back, just like a turtle shell
Nobody do it better, all my brothers tryna get some cheddar
We all want our cut like the Shredder
Me and my bros come together for the dough
Bought the orange Lamborghini, call it Michelangelo
With the nun-chuck door and I'm pullin' up slow
When we fall up in the party, they know anything goes
Check my Rolex, they say I'm the man of the hour
All this green in my pockets, you can call it turtle power

Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked

Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked

Knock, knock, you about to get shell shocked

Ain't nothin' that could come in between me and my brothers
We all around if it's going down
It's just us, all for one, yeah you hear 'em right
Our business done, we disappear into the night
Came up together, so we all down for the fight
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
Family, ain't nothin' strong as that
And I'll be posted up where the strongest at
Brothers by my side, city on my back, real heroes
That's what the people want
They ain't born, gotta create 'em
Sayin' we gone as soon as we save 'em
Thats part of the plan, by my side I'mma keep my brothers
Live or die man we need each other! Huh!

Yea, you already know,
When I walk the fuck by
You can’t act like
I ain’t the fliest thing you ever seen in your
Whole entire muthafuckin sorry ass life

You can’t say I’m not the freshest nigga you ever seen
Keep a couple grand nothin less in my jeans
That’s probably why yo bitch keep ringin’ my phone
When I pull up she can’t leave me alone
Lil’ homie I grind, no sleep
I’m good in the hood everybody know me
I got my truck on blast
Hear me when I roll through
Stntin’ like a young nigga supposed to
Stunt’n like I’m supposed to

Ridin’ with my hat cocked back
Smokin’ something good 3 blunts and I’m smacked out
All city on smash, game on padlock
26 inch rims throw ‘em on the matchbox
6 bad hoes man I can’t choose one
3 cell phones I just can’t use one
You see how often I spit
You just off bread hun
This the shit they can’t do young
Talk fly if you look ‘em in the air
Too young, you wonder were I got these Gucci pair of shoes from
A lot of ya’ll mad
To me it’s just funny
I see why ya’ll hatin man the hoes just love me
And you know I’m gettin’ shhh
Fuck it I ain’t gotta say it
The tab taken care of nigga I ain’t gotta pay it
Yea, I’m all day with it, year round
I bet if you was here now

You can’t say I’m not the freshest nigga you ever seen
Keep a couple grand nothin less in my jeans
That’s probably why yo bitch keep ringin’ my phone
When I pull up she can’t leave me alone
Lil’ homie I grind, no sleep
I’m good in the hood everybody know me
I got my truck on blast
Hear me when I roll through
Stunt’n like a young nigga supposed to

Got a fat knot, blunt rolled up
Me I ride clean
Neck froze up
Bad bitch on the side
My niggas all rich
Foreign whips is what they drive
Yea, I smell like Gucci and big money too
See them guys with me? they gettin’ money too
Ride 222s and got heat so
If a nigga try me you a big prob you runnin’ into
I smoke a lot need blunt or 2
At a time whole pounds I be runnin’ through
Yea, I got a dime bitch coming through
Cause I pimp like I’m supoosed to
Wonder how I get it like this, I could show you
It’s all leather in the whip when I roll through
This year I’m a get shit cleared
Take a look at this kid

You can’t say I’m not the freshest nigga you ever seen
Keep a couple grand nothin less in my jeans

[Hook]
Aye you probably think you know where this is goin’
But this ain’t one of them kinda songs
Somebody roll and let’s get it on
While I forget it all and get zoned

[Verse 1]
And I remember back in the day
Before I thought about gettin’ paid
The ladies ain’t wan’ give me no play
The haters ain't have nothin’ to say
They never let me into the club
The radio ain’t show me no love
Gave my all, but it just wasn’t enough
And complaining too, it’s just how it was
And now I’m just posted
With my baddest bitch and we just kick it in this villa watchin’ pictures gettin roasted
Vision gettin’ clearer yea she open
But her eyes low, never under the clouds baby we floatin’

[Hook - 2x]
Aye you probably think you know where this is goin
but this ain’t one of them kinda songs
somebody roll and let’s get it on
While I forget it all and get zoned

[Verse 2]
I started coming up in the game
And people started knowin’ my name
They tried to put me into that lane
And we had to go our separate ways
Instead of fussin’ and flippin’ out
I did my thing and figured it out
Security trippin I ain’t puttin it out
Smokin loud
And all my peoples got champagne, fast cars by the bar wasted
Potent marijuana that aroma make her wanna taste it
Horses in my car, little Louis on my bracelet
When you live just like a star it feels so amazing

[Hook - 2x]
Aye you probably think you know where this is goin
but this ain’t one of them kinda songs
somebody roll and let’s get it on
While I forget it all and get zoned

Uh high but I’m focused one thing they know is
(If you rollin wit tha gang, then you rollin up another plane)
Ok no stems, no seeds I keep it G
(If you rollin’ wit’ tha gang, then you rollin up another plane) [2x]
And them lame niggas get dissed I let that bad bitch twist
(If you rollin up tha gang, then you rollin wit another plane) [3x]---Lyrics submitted by wallstreet jr.

If You Let Me Stroke Your Keys

Lil Ma, I Got Them Pro Tunes

Beating In Your Drum
While Im Playing With Your High Hat

(Chorus)
I don’t want to be unusual
But there’s a lot of things that I can see me doing to you.

And even thought there’s probably other places we can go, 
We in my studio,, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, ohhhh yeeaaa


And No, It Aint Gonn Stop

Puttin All Them Scratches On My Back

I'm Gripin On Your Thighs
We Tangled Like Some Cables
From The Front look In Your Eyes

But I Do Something That Just Make You Do It

(Chorus)
I don’t want to be unusual
But there’s a lot of things that I can see me doing to you.

Shit 

It's Wiz Khalifa man 
This shit hot, right? 

Now don't blink cause the flow is closer, don't think 
True diplomat, no Jim Jones and no Pink 
And the city wanna know what, except that I claim 
Blackout be the gang, it's attached to my veins 
And I don't got a problem giving naps to Elaine 
Order every syllable, every rap to my name, ye 
The grim reaper came back with a cane 
That's me, spittin crack to your brain 
Niggers, they can't stand me, ladies, they demand me 
Damn your man's handy 
And I'm the mayor when I blam with them hands 
Have you seeing stars like you walk with them Grammies 
Your reign was short, I'm running it now 
Knock your teeth out for biting, now you be gunning my style 
I keep it, honey I'm selling them, I'm the blackout 
Put my sneakers to your face, you'll be running your mouth 

It's too late nigga 
It's too late nigga 
Man, it's too late 
Y'all niggas ain't early enough 
It's my time nigga 

And some say I'm contradictory 
Cause I flow nice and spit I mean, trying to get green 
Play it how I split teams 
You'll be sixteen, storming nigga sixteen 
Six two, feeling glock with a sick lean 
Big dreams, only two words, get green 
Which means never had no job 
I spit, to keep it simple, the truth like no lies 
No god, I know why 
I make it clear, there's no reason for your life 
And I make it ahead, see me speeding and blow by 

You dudes fake, I see through you with closed eyes 
And won't stop, till they can get rich 
And make pay from the rap I spit 
It ain't hard to tell, like a snitch, that I'm next on deck 
And care less about who making the pay 
Listen, it's too late 

It's too late nigga 
It's too late man 
It's too late 
Y'all dudes fake, pray for me 
It's my time nigga 

You catch rabies if you bite this hair 
Safe to say I don't like to share, ye 
You see I'm what the ladies want, so they like to stare 
I'm a beast, I eat tracks and bite the snare 
See I got blind eyes and they like the glare 
Dudes hate cause I rock shit they like to wear 
And I'll battle anybody who can fight the fan 
Spit, crack, put the pipe in their ears 
And my boys have the nigga broke down in a second 
Shots split a clown into sections 
Round your protection, I'm back at it like a crack addict 
The fact I spit crack dog, I'm ass-backwards 
I lay it down, bring a clown to his knees 
See, we be a truce in D, ye 
And niggas faking like they kicking cause they moving them keys 
But if I shoot you I be doing a deed nigga 

It's too late 
It's too late nigga 
It's too late man 
It's too late 
Y'all niggas ain't early enough 
It's my turn nigga---Lyrics submitted by Cierra.

[Intro:]
Damn, we back in business

[Verse 1:]
Uh, wakin' up the neighbors, you could hear the headboard shakin'
I'll leave all of your body parts achin'
Speedin' up the pace while I look right into your face
You tell me that's that good shit you're tastin'
And I know you like it from the side
But tonight I'mma just unwind and let you ride and watch you take it
Cause I'm tryin' to get you so wet, I mean so wet
If there's a record for this shit then I'mma break it
It's goin' down no matter the place or time I call
I got enough space
Think anything you think you want, no prob I got enough cake
All up in it in the mornin', knowin' damn well that I had you up late
Ain't buyin' it you ain't spendin' it, you keep throwin' it back so I'm givin' it

[Hook:]
You love when I get up in it
You love when I get, you love when I get [x4]

[Verse 2:]
Wake up when I bake up that's just somethin' that I do
Pick your favorite sex scene, that's what I'm gon' do to you
Up in your bed's where you probably belong
Givin' you all that I got 'til it's gone
Sexy as fuck you still got them heels on
Favorite position, we tryin' them all
Once I get in can't get out of my zone
Fuck you so good you won't pick up your phone
And when your girlfriends or whoever do call
You fuckin' with me so you tell 'em you gone
You don't smoke so I break it down, you roll it up
You poke it out, your face down so I hold it up
You don't give a shit that my money so big I can't fold it up
Plus I ain't tired 'til you finish, this ain't a race but I'm winnin'

[Hook x2]

[Break:]
You don't even gotta name a place where we can go
Cause we already goin', goin', goin'
Don't nobody gotta ask or even got to know
Baby we already goin', goin', goin'

Diamonds all on my brain, nigga
Gold watches, gold chain, nigga
Hundred thou’ on champagne, nigga
Yeah, my money insane, nigga
Yeah, I’m making it rain, nigga
When I was just on a plane, nigga
Buying gear, flying here
Fuck what you heard, its my time of year
If I’m in the club I get a hundred stacks
I’m always rollin’ up so I could laugh at that
Them other niggas stole my swag but I don’t want it back
My nigga, uh, I was on this but I’m onto that
You see it in the closet before it’s on the rack
Was at the ? Hawaii now I’m going back
My nigga, uh
I got so much money I should start a bank
So much paper right in front of me it’s hard to think
Find so many bottles it’s gon be hard to drink
But I’m still pouring up and my family here
And they rolling up so, ugh

[Chorus x2]
The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I’m throwing mine
Cause my money long
The quicker you’re here
The faster you go
That’s why, where I come from, the only thing we know is

Work hard, play hard (x4)

Hopped your pretty ass up in this fucking car
Bitch I’m out this world, girl you know I’m a star
Used to buying rounds, but now we buy the bar
Last year they had to ask, now they know who we are
‘Bout shit, walk in the building, I own shit
You can tell by who I’m on the phone with
Damn nigga, talkin’ bout grown shit
Nigga, too busy jackin’ my swag
Need to fuck around, get ya own shit
Get ya own cars, get ya own clothes
Get ya own smoke, get ya own bitch
Yeah, you ain’t reppin’ my gang, get ya own clique

[Chorus x2]
The bigger the bill
The harder you ball
Well I’m throwing mine
Cause my money long
The quicker you’re here
The faster you go
That’s why, where I come from, the only thing we know is

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Go hard, make sure you do whatever it is that you gotta do
Thats your job
And niggas gonna hate but that’s no prob’
So hey fuck ‘em don’t need nothing from ‘em
Some niggas talking but the shit they claiming don’t mean nothing
It’s straight from Cali
That’s whats in my joint
That’s what I’m puffin’
OG and been one since I was young enough that know that everybody was gonna know me
Most niggas don’t see

[Chorus]
The bigger the bill

I got all these J’s rolled up
And got all these drinks poured up
I bought all these bottles up in this club
Came here with all of my dogs
But I’m tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends
Yeah, tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends, ball

I got all these J’s rolled up
And got all these drinks poured up
I bought all these bottles up in this club
Came here with all of my dogs
But I’m tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends
Yeah, tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends, ball

You and your friends, up in my car
Rolling up J’s, flying with the stars
Don’t gotta ask the price ‘cause you already know
Watch full of ice, no light it still glow
With you and your friends, me and my dogs
Left your nigga to be with my squad
He talk a lot of shit, but he ain’t really on
He hit it too soft, but me I go hard, like
Oohy baby, when you with me you go crazy
I want you to be my lady
Girl you could bring your girlfriends, I ain’t hating

I got all these J’s rolled up
And got all these drinks poured up
I bought all these bottles up in this club
Came here with all of my dogs
But I’m tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends
Yeah, tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends, ball

I’m parked outside in a Range Rover
Coke white, so tight, game over
Coupe to the block, bop to the bang
Car full of girls in a blue Mustang
Four y’all, more y’all, caravan
V.I.P model in hand, bottle in hand
Wobble again
I make it crack in the back a Benz while cracking the frame
On the highway, just me and Wiz
With a dirt dozen, about to handle this
Was they cousins or was they twins?
I love it when they both go all in
Like that, this one and that one
See he wants the cute one, I want the fat one
Bet she pay what she weigh
I’m looking for a Jennifer Holiday in my way

I got all these J’s rolled up
And got all these drinks poured up
I bought all these bottles up in this club
Came here with all of my dogs
But I’m tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends
Yeah, tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends, ball

I got all these J’s rolled up
And got all these drinks poured up
I bought all these bottles up in this club
Came here with all of my dogs
But I’m tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends
Yeah, tryna leave with you and your friends
You and your friends, ball ---

[Hook: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?
That’s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
So what I keep ‘em rolled up?
Saggin’ my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And smoke them hoes down ’til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I’m with your bitch smokin’ grade A

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
You know what?
It’s like I’m 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin’, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I’m on the chase, Chevy
It's gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it
Dippin’ away, time keeps slippin’ away
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Up front, four blunts, like, “Khalifa put the weed in a J”

[Hook: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?
That’s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free


[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in there
There's gonna be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up

[Wiz Khalifa]
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up

[Snoop Dogg]
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang

[Wiz Khalifa]
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it


[Snoop Dogg]
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

[Hook: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?
That’s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free


[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun

[Hook: Bruno Mars]
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?
That’s how its supposed to be
Living young and wild and free---Lyrics submitted by denniz ramirez.
